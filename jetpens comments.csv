justin0979,"January 29, 2011","From the perspective of a university student, this pen is excellent. From
working out mechanisms in organic chemistry to just simply writing (notes or
essays), this pen does an outstanding job. Compared to the Uni-ball Signo RT UM-138 (0.38), this pen is better built, has a
slightly more comfortable grip, has a much larger volume of ink, and writes with
the same ""thinness"" (but with a darker black). The RT's black ink always have
looked faded to me and they all definitely run out of ink way too rapidly or
even a mediocre writer/drawer/whatever. The RT has the ""clicker"" ability (which I originally wanted this pen to be and
would buy another one if it were a ""clicker"") but the cap removal process isn't
a big deal. I've actually started to like the look of the cap and the way it
snaps on makes it feel like it's a high class pen.  Overall, this pen is one of the best that I've used."
keessago,"March 28, 2014","i bought this pen expecting to be able to ink drawings for watercolor since it
said it was waterproof, but this pen smears SO easily i'm incredibly
disappointed.  also, as others have said, the ink flows out of the pen very smoothly, but the
actual design of the pen makes it a bit uncomfortable to write with. it may just
be that it's a bit wider than im used to "
Suzy,"March 21, 2016","Not sure what's going on with the black ink lately.  I have loved these for use
with watercolors for a long time now.  Purchased some black and black-brown pens
as replacements for ones that had run out.  The black-brown ink is just fine, no
bleeding or smearing.  However, the three black pens I purchased (.5, .38 and
.28) are reactivated by water like most other pens would be.  I'll keep them for
use with dry media, but now have to find a gel pen I can use with my
watercolors."
mookiemorjax,"September 1, 2011","A marvelous everyday pen. This pen is my favorite. I have been ordering other
pens to try them out and I always end up coming back to this one. I have gone
through 11 of these pens so far and plan to continue using them. Some may find
the line too thin, but I like it. The rubber grip seems to wear out and get a
bit loose over longer periods of time (after replacing the inkwell once or
twice). The cap also becomes a touch loose over a similar time period. I always
put two or three of these on any Jetpens order I make. At the risk of making
these pens be out of stock more frequently, I would recommend this pen to anyone
looking for a hardworking, high quality, everyday pen. "
Moebius,"June 11, 2011","The best everyday pen sold by JetPens. Can be used for writing and for drawing.
Waterproof. Mitsubishi (Uni Ball) makes fantastic products. My favorite brand."
laura.a.soria,"September 17, 2019","I got this pen to use with my zebra highlighters after seeing the ""Best Gel Pens
with Mildliners"" video, and though I love the weight of the pen and it writes
with ease...it smudges like mascara on a rainy day."
Zuri,"July 28, 2022","I didn't believe the hype for this pen but it was love at first write. Smooth
and pigmented, I carry mine everywhere and plan on being the full set."
avalaurv,"February 25, 2022","Really love using this pen to cram a lot of information onto notecards or sticky
notes. Writes smoothly and neatly, and allows for a lot of detail."
kav1,"February 14, 2022",one of the best gel pens hands down
rachael,"February 8, 2022",Perfect for my bullet journal 
Pen lady,"February 8, 2022","Love this pen, it doesn’t disappoint, color is vibrant and smooth"
tinmanfrisbie,"November 17, 2021","Such a great pen!  Never have to worry about it not working and the lines are
consistent throughout the lifespan of the pen."
heidiheidi160,"August 7, 2021",So smooth
devonannasmith,"September 25, 2020","It's a lovely pen to write and draw with, but mine started leaking after a month
of gentle use - ink just dripping out of the nib. I have a very light hand so
I'm certain I didn't damage it. Maybe I just got a dud but I'm really
disappointed. "
princess cordelia,"June 29, 2020",really smooth!
wallijonn,"May 27, 2019","Excellent results with Maruman Mnemosyne paper. Very good consistency with
Rhodia paper.  Scratchiness can be felt, and heard, on 20 lb. copier paper.
Writing slower minimized the scratching sound. So, this pen is well suited to
methodical writers. It is easy to write two sentences clearly within the
Rhodia's 5mm graph spacing. Capitalized cursive lettering is outstanding,
distinctive, almost Calligraphic. The DX 0.38, Black, lays down a nice wet, very thin, crisp, dark, black line,
but its ball tends to create a middle-of-the-line depression in every character
written with moderate  pressure is applied, resulting in a sheen, with sporadic
glitter, which exacerbates the contrast differential of pure white paper and
black ink, the overall effect being that the dark ink distracts when reading
back. (Best seen under a magnifying glass.)I sometimes got dropouts in the middle of a curve, like when script writing an
""S"", ""I"",  ""Q"", and ""G"", but as I acclimated to the pen its frequency
diminished. I find that I must keep the grip pressure consistent, otherwise I
get inconsistent results. Sometimes I got a little blobbing on cursive loops.
The lighter the pressure applied the more likely that dropouts occur. I got some
letter beginning and letter end pooling, which means that I left the nib tip on
the paper too long or I didn't keep the timing consistent. I didn't get any
letter-beginning drop outs, like one is likely to get with a ball point pen,
where the ink doesn't lay down as the ball starts to roll.Initially the DX 0.38, Black, was scratchy on Maruman Mnemosyne paper, and,
surprisingly, the more pressure I applied the better the results. Applying very
light pressure is not this pen's strong suit, but that may be attributed to the
pen body, and my technique. yymv. Not possessing the expertise of a draftsman
(but I do fine detail work under a magnifying glass), my straight lines
sometimes have variable density. Meaning that I probably twisted the pen away
from me the further I wrote. Using a thin steel ruler alleviated that problem. No fault of the ink, but with the UM-151 and UM-153 pen bodies I find that I
have to grasp the pen right under the rubber barrel. The further up the barrel I
held it, the scratchier it got. So I had to vary the pressure and rotate the pen
until I got to a point that the writing didn't scratch as much. The cap is very short, about half of the length of the UM-153 cap. Posted it is
longer than the posted UM-153. The barrel rubber is longer than the UM-153.
There is more distance between the rubber grip and the start of the metal tip
than the UM-153. The UM-151 body is slimmer than the UM-153 body. It's not the felt scratchiness that bothers me, it's the sound of the nib as it
scratches. Which means I have to use smooth coated paper. 3.5 stars. "
jmlove,"May 20, 2018","These are quickly becoming my favorite pens for my journal. They write so
smoothly and are so fine but very dark so you can write small but it's still
legible! I bought a big pack of colors but there was no black in it!! Glad to
pick it up here at jetpens and I'm looking forward to ordering all the rest of
the colors I didn't get in my pack!"
elle,"December 30, 2017","love this pen- writes super thinly, which i enjoy both. only issue would be that
i once had dropped one of these pens and it began to act up :/. just don't drop
it and it will work perfectly! (also rec the pilot juice black pen in 0.38...
writes darker but is also a favorite alongside and cheaper!) "
gatorvill3,"April 26, 2017","I am in love with these pens. If you wait a min before placing watercolor over
the lines, it doesn't bleed...unless you are looking for that effect. "
Yvonne C,"December 6, 2016","Great pen, but no longer waterproof. UNI has made their name partly for their
great smooth waterproof ink - not the case anymore  - like many mentioned, the
Brown-black is the only one that still seems mostly water resistance (minimal
smearing and if you wait for it to dry it is waterproof) - but the black pens
totally disappoint - there is no way to use this to sketch and then watercolor -
if yo want a disposable waterproof pen for sketching you should look for the
Uniball Vision/Eye series or the 207/307, Stick,  Impact, Air, Deluxe. I imagine
other UNI pens might also be waterproof but the ones I listed are the ones I
have tried and saw no smear from the *black* ink - I have not tried the other
colors."
RAPIDPUNCHES,"October 4, 2016","I used this pen for a third of the pages in my art book with heavy hatching and
it lasted all the way to the end. The ink chamber was spotless. I'll be buying
refills for it for a while. "
jakkofclubs,"September 15, 2016","I love how black the ink is and the thickness of the tip, but I've been using
this pen to take notes at school for 3 weeks and my goodness does it lose ink
fast. I estimate I have probably 2 weeks of regular use left in it; I've never
had a pen run out of ink this quickly."
howardbstein,"June 15, 2016","Nice pen, although I understood these were waterproof — not so,  a bit of
moisture from a summertime hand will smear the ink, so cannot imagine what might
happen with a spilled glass of water. So Micron it remains for me though am
always on lookout for a better pen. It's important to note paper used — I use
Clairefontaine paper, excellent for Microns and just about every other pen. A
toothier paper in a journal will make Micron writing slower, less flow. But a
waterproof pen is essential, as is permanence of course."
Annette,"March 4, 2016","These are great pens: precise without being scratchy. They are my go-to pen now
when I am too impatient to use a fountain pen."
dorn9503,"November 12, 2015","With this pen's fine line I was able to fit easily 5 lines of text in a standard
rule line of a notebook.  It took little time to dry on a 'semi gloss' type
workbook paper, to avoid smudges.  I fully enjoyed using this pen and it has
made the short list of the 10 different pens that I am testing."
casan.you,"October 30, 2015","I was upset because I selected the wrong pen at checkout apparently but this one
is amazing. I am a pilot hi-tec fan but this is officially my favorite pen right
now."
Hank Sinatra,"October 9, 2015","Perfect for annotating charts.I need to make notes on sheet music, and the Signo UM-151 has a nice fine line
and a variety of colors.The 0.38 is a little thin for reading at a distance. The 0.50 mm is the best
balance between a fine line and legibility"
jhan544792,"September 9, 2015","I've used about 10 pens in four years. Ink writes great, smooth rolling and good
weight and grip. Only gripe about it is that about 4 of those pens dried up when I had about a
fourth of ink left, and no matter what I did it did not alleviate the symptom.
Could be because they were in the 10 pack box that I got, but I find it hard to
believe that this dried up whereas my Zebra Sarasa never has even if it's in
storage for 6+ months."
NewDayCC,"August 8, 2015","All of the 0.38 Uni-ball Signo pens are wonderful. Not too fine - not too bold -
absolutely perfect."
eugenebl,"June 27, 2009","I might be in love. I bought this pen as well as the Pilot G-2 Gel Ink Pen (also 0.38mm). The Pilot
is okay. This one is much better. For my purposes (illustration), it is perfect.
Not only does it give a great line, but there are NO SURPRISES. It doesn't stop
making a line if you tilt it to the side a bit, only to suddenly give a big
thick one when you press a little harder. If you tilt this pen sideways, it
still always gives a great line, but a thinner one. So you can use it both for
light pen-sketching and for thick, unwavering lines. There really have been no downsides. This is professional-quality."
laura.9653,"December 29, 2022","I loved this pen! It was great because I didn't see ink blobs when I began
writing, maybe after a while I would see one or two but then I dropped it. It
hasn't been the same ever since. Don't drop it!"
mayer,"December 26, 2022",Very smooth writing pen. 
harmonyh,"December 7, 2022",A great gel pen if you want something very fine. 
aimeeryan,"November 15, 2022","I buy all the time, a favorite of all time pen!"
withadventure,"September 22, 2022","I really do like these pens, but I find that they skip often and that gets
really annoying. Even the slightest bit of anything on the tip will make it
impossible to write with this thing. I got these to make annotations in my textbooks and in the margins of my
research papers, but even on regular paper it picks up small fibers and starts
skipping. If you want to be patient and keep wiping your pen off then these are great, but
they didn't do well for what I wanted. "
pendragonpost,"September 5, 2022",Wonderful pen and writes like a gel pen very smoothly :)
Ma Elena,"August 20, 2022","My favorite pen for writing in small spaces - the ink flows smoothly, and the

Seth B,"June 14, 2022","Personal preference, the 0.38 is too small for me, as well as the grip is SUPER
uncomfortable. Not enough weight to feel good in the hand."

Pilot Tec C4 on my desk."

mrader3,"April 3, 2022","I ordered four different colors, and most of them write pretty well. But some of
them (not many) won't write well at all. It's like no gel is coming out. That's
a little frustrating. Overall, I really like these pens. Black writes the best."

germanissac,"August 16, 2021","Great pen, glides pretty well on the page. Has a bit of a scratch if you tend to
hold your pen more flat compared to page. It does not bleed much. The ink does

this batch of new pens, or perhaps second after the Platinum Preppy fountain
pen.Black is always my favorite for general writing, although the Blue-black from
the blue-black pen sampler and the Bordeaux Black are very nice too. I'm using

scravey,"January 23, 2020",Really like everything. Will be ordering again
elCajon,"January 23, 2020","This is the semi-official choice of JetPens for a reason. It is a uniquely
satisfying writing instrument. The dark color of the ink along with its smooth
and precise feel are not matched by many more expensive pens. I will say the
0.38 mm size is very fine and can be a touch scratchy on some surfaces. However,
the ability to write finely makes changes my handwriting a little. As I said,
this thing is quite unique and I am impressed. I am currently trying out some
other widths to see if there one that I prefer over the 0.38."

todd.holscher,"January 11, 2020","outstanding if you want an incredibly thin line.  my son uses these in school
tests where the teacher let's you bring ""one index card full of notes"".  Amazing
how small he can write and keep it legible."
missCoco,"January 9, 2020","Got these for my BF's birthday - the cheapest ""best gift"" I've ever found. He was using ball point pens, with a major scratch factor and issues with ink
consistency (ok, I bought him new pens because I hated when he loaned me his . .
. ) and yesterday he took all his old pens into the break room at work for other
people to pick up! I also bought him a few of the other dark colors, which he likes because he can
take color-coded notes without the red and blue overwhelming the look of the
page. "

tomincroix,"June 7, 2019","I got one of these to try.  I have some Pilot G-2's in 0.38 so I'm familiar with
that size point.  The point on this one is scratchy, almost like a calligraphy
nib.  And the ink doesn't seem to flow very evenly - almost acts like the pen
has been dropped on the point.  I like these ultra fine pens & will try another
brand next time."

rtdurr,"May 31, 2019","I was most excited about getting this pen and it is very nice. I'm using a Pilot
G-2 .38 mm on my bullet journal and I am happy with it. I am thinking about
whether I like this pen better. There is no doubt that this pen makes some
really nice vivid high contrast marks on both my cheap notebook paper and my
Rhodia dot pad. But there are two things that keep it from being 5 stars. It
feels small in my hands compared to the G2. And it has a cap. I kind of like
clicking the pen. I'm sure I will use this pen going forward but as good as it
is for me it was not a perfect 5 star."
DelCampobrown,"May 25, 2019","The Signo UM-151 (aka Signo DX) has been a long time favorite ""go to"" pen for

Tangle List,"September 9, 2018","This review is for those who can't decide between the 0.5 and 0.38 versions of
the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen. The 0.5 simply glides better across my
journal. That's perfect for fast, free-flowing writing, but my penmanship
suffers as a result. The 0.38 version, in my opinion, has a better balance
between smooth writing and producing neat penmanship. I prefer the 0.38 for
journaling because it's looks nicer while rereading old journal entries. The
smaller writing also saves a considerable amount of journal space.   The bottom line, though, is that they're both excellent, 5-star pens and worth
every penny. Buy one of each and see what meets your personal needs better. "

masher023,"July 3, 2018","Nothing about this experience was good. I'm a fan of the signo brand and i own
multiple types of signo pens, this one is the worst pen I've ever owned, the

Emerald,"June 2, 2018","I was enticed by the many good things I've heard about the UM-151 and decided to
order one. I was incredibly disappointed by it's performance. Many people have
told me how great and smooth it is, how it's waterproof, and how it's incredibly
cheap for how awesome it is, but none of those things are true. Though it's
smoother than some other fine-point pens, it can't compare to a Pentel Slicci or
Pilot Hi-Tec-C. One of the main reasons I bought the UM-151 was to see how well
it would work with watercolors, but the ink isn't water resistant in the
slightest. It's also a very expensive pen for it's quality - a Pentel RSVP works
better than it for a fraction of the price. I would not recommend this product.
Save your money, kids."
SUEJACK,"June 2, 2018","I use this pen and the 0.5 and love both, but the .38 has become my go-to pen. 
I first learned about it--and about JetPens--in a New York Times article from
2015, where the writer said ""The Signo, for me, hits the perfect balance between
surgical accuracy and lubricating ink flow; there’s enough ink to help the pen
glide smoothly along the page with grace, but not so much that, as I’m a
lefty, it smudges."" Agreed!  Here's the link:

xtaforster,"February 17, 2018","Honestly, I'm not sure if it's the quality of the paper I'm writing on right now
(Mnemosyne notebook by Maruman) or if it's this pen, but the nib does not always
distribute the ink equitably on the paper. Sometimes the flow stops or skips as
I'm writing. I tend to think it's the paper quality, as I loved this pen before,
but I was writing on a different foolscap: that of the Kokuyo MIO notebook. In
that case, I LOVED this pen, which is why I bought it again."

Jasmine,"February 7, 2018","The Uni-ball Signo DX is the best pen that I have tried so far. This pen's ink
is very smooth and consistent, and also allows you to write at a variety of
angles without skipping. The tip of the pen makes really precise lines, which
can be rather unforgiving if your handwriting is not great. However, I would
recommend this pen to people with small handwriting. The body of the pen is
sturdy and the grip isn't uncomfortable. Keep in mind that the grip is rather
high up on the pen, which could pose a problem if you grip your pens close to
the tip like I do."
william.lee.hemphill,"February 6, 2018",The reviewers are right!  These are the best rollerball pens!

of course more sturdy because conical not needle"

trainor,"September 8, 2017","Because of this review I ordered this pen.  It writes great but the tip is a
little too fine for my taste.  I was immediately disappointed that it wasn't
retractable as I use my pen at work throughout the day, and who wants to worry
about re-attaching the tip after every use?  Gave it to a co-worker who was
instantly impressed with the way it writes."

anymore."
etiernan597,"August 28, 2017","This line is much thicker than expected. However, the writing is extremely
smooth. I don't have any complaints, but the line does not match other pens near

gasergeant,"March 28, 2017","I prefer retractable pens but these are every bit as excellent as they are
talked up to be. Smooth writing, the ink doesn't flow endlessly if you pause but
maintain contact with the writing surface. The point is elegant, and accentuates
how garrish my handwriting is. Most importantly, the pen always writes,
immediately, without hesitation, which is great if you're trying to take
something down quickly the first time."
lolobrown00,"March 21, 2017",Very fluid
hannahbear120,"March 14, 2017","The pen is very good as far as comfort, color, and even application. However, it runs out of ink very quickly. I used about a third of the cartridge
within two days of note-taking (I do take a lot of notes). Additionally, within
the past week or so (I've had the been for almost three weeks and I use it only
for a daily to do sheet and writing things on post-it notes) the pen has been
scratching a bit. It's not as bad as some pens, but it's still a disappointment
for such a new pen, especially as it still has half of its ink left. The final
complaint I have with it is that the ink smears when highlighted. It doesn't
smear from my hand dragging across the page as I write (I""m left handed), but
even hours after I've written something, when I highlight it using my
mildliners, the ink is moved slightly.Overall, I think that this is a good pen for the price, but if it is used for
vigorous note-taking or things where a highlighter is used, I would probably
look for a different model. For other daily use, it's a great buy."

shunyaoflaherty18,"January 29, 2017","I really liked this pen... when it worked. I was using it and I put it back in
my bag, and the next day, it stops working. The ink is super light, it's really
skippy, and there is still about 3/4 of the ink still in the barrel. Attempting
to fix it, I think I broke it even more, which didn't help either.  While it was
working, I thought it wrote very smooth, but with enough control on it that it
wasn't slipping everywhere. If only it was more durable... also it connects some
of your letters if you don't lift your pen all the way off the paper between
letters"

Zorwick,"July 19, 2016","I am a college professor and I spend TONS of time grading every year.  These are
my favorite pens in the world because there are lots of colors with nice
contrast (emerald and mandarin are favorites) for marking, and because the fine
point means I can get more comments into small spaces.  I love these so much
they are pretty much the only pens I use - and, I have probably used 30 in the
past 4-5 years until they ran out of ink.  These pens are so good, I never lose
them or forget about them to they get dried out - I use up every last one.   
These are my favorite office supply - thanks jet pens!!"
EdwardDillinger,"July 6, 2016","This is the best black pen I have ever used. The ink flows very freely and
requires almost no pressure at all; I used it to take notes for a class that
lasted 1:15 per session and my hand never cramped or felt uncomfortable, and I
take extensive notes. A word of caution for those with small handwriting,
though: the line thickness of this pen in a .38 tip size is comparable to a G-2
in a .5 tip size. I'm thinking this is because of how well the ink flows with
little pressure, so I'm not complaining, but if you like a finer line, I'd size

wouldn't really write but the other one I bought performed very well laying down
a crisp saturated black line. This is definitely a solid pen and the ink comes
out so smoothly that writing fatigue does not come so quickly, definitely a
repurchase!"

hernandezvm94,"March 15, 2016","This is my favorite pen to use for note taking because the ink flows well, it's
rich in color and dries fairly fast for a gel pen! My only sadness from this is
that it does smudge a bit when using a highlighter right away (if you're the
type that gets upset over the ink showing on the edge of a highlighter like
myself). other than that I highly recommend this pen for all writing needs!"

objecterror,"January 21, 2016","I am a fan of fine point pens. the sharper the line the better. I am the type
that would dry out a gel pen so the ink drew a finer line towards the end of the
shelf life. the UM151 is great. I have not written with a 0.38mm pen until 7
years prior and I haven't looked back. the sharp point feels amazing on all
sorts of paper and smoothly glides along without too much tearing during the
writing process. the point is almost always smooth -- writing is a breeze and so
much fun. a great everyday carry pen, precise and smooth."

lucezul,"August 14, 2015","The best pens I've ever used. For years, I've been trying to find the right pen

pamfuchs11,"June 21, 2015","I love this pen...and what a bargain! The .38 nib is nice and thin--but not too

what they've been missing! "
Roy M,"June 20, 2015","I don't understand the appeal of this pen at all.  It does dry quickly, but it's

use this for note taking (University) as well as jotting down little notes here

extra fine) fountain pens. I will probably always just add one or two to an
order, even if I am already above the $25. Just give one a shot. Highly

to dry the second it touches the paper. "

often though."
veeveevo,"June 29, 2013","I love this pen. it writes smoothly, its super sharp-just how a 0.38 should be.I have problems with the ink cartridge though. I bout 2 pens and a pack of
refills.ALL of them stopped working half way through. I tried everything from rubbing it
on erasers to soaking in alcohol. Nothing worked. At first i just though it was
a defective but now i doubt it.it wouldnt show any signs, just writing
beautifully and then all of a sudden it stops working. From ink to no ink. I
really want to buy this pen again for its small size and all but for now I`ll
search for other 0.38 pens from JetPen."

kdsato2,"February 21, 2013","My go-to everyday pen. For my small handwriting, this is the pen for me. Ink is
very black, writes smoothly, and the viscosity is great (the ink does rarely
feathers, depending on the paper). I'm a student and this pen has made a huge
difference in how clean my notes look."
amialungo,"January 30, 2013","I love this pen, I've probably ordered around $50-worth in the last year.  I'm a college student in engineering so I take a lot of notes; I'm also left
handed and this is the only pen I own that consistently doesn't smear. The .38
is great, it makes my old .7 mm G-2's look like markers!  Sometimes when I write the tip tears a bit through paper but I tend to press
really hard when I write. Definitely worth buying in black and pretty much every
other color.  "
kdeng,"December 13, 2012",Best everyday pen! All time favorite
kim31227,"August 16, 2012","I am a gel ink pen fanatic and use nothing but gel ink pens. This pen is really

ink flows really well, and there is no smudging, leaking etc... at all!  Best pen ever!"
stevedoxas,"June 16, 2012","Really nice pen.  Smoothest gel-ink pen I have ever written with.  So smooth,

the Zebra Sarasa (0.3mm.)"
briandavis1978,"February 8, 2012","This is my absolute favorite pen. I picked up a bunch without much consideration
when I lived in Japan a few years ago. After a few months, I realized just how
amazing they were. It was the first time I had ever said to myself, ""wow, what a
great pen."" Then after moving back to the states I realized they were impossible
to find outside of Japan. Not even art supply stores had them. I finally found
them on Jetpens-what a godsend! They're the best!"
ashleyspurlin,"January 5, 2012","I will admit, I have been a Pilot fangirl for a very long time. It wasn't until
I became bored with my typical Pilots that I decided to venture out. And boy am
I glad I did! I will admit without reserve that I am very quickly becoming a
complete fan of the Signo line. I've never been a big fan of needle points and
was slightly disappointed that the smallest non-needle point offered by Pilot
was a 0.38. After branching out to other manufacturers, though, I'm finding
plenty of alternatives. Now if only I could make a UM-151 fit my Pilot
Cavalier..."
aknewhope,"December 29, 2011","This is my first one of a few pens purchased from Jetpens.com. I heard of this
site on a podcast. I am a long time Pilot G-2 fanatic because it's what is sold
here in retailers(USA). The Pilot G-2 was the best I knew, but they normally
always carry the 0.7mm which is a bit too large. After reading many reviews, I
decided to try the Uni-ball Signo DX UM-151 in black in sizes 0.28, 0.38, and
0.5mm. I am very pleased. They write very smoothly compared to my Pilot G-2
0.5mm pens. Also, if the fact that the ink does not bleed with water, it makes
them that much better. Of course people will probably argue that taking off a
cap is too time consuming but, to be honest, I think it keeps the tip from
drying out much better than  retraction. I also purchased a few other Uni-ball
products and I am hooked on Uni-ball. I work in the manufacturing sector, and
everything I see from Uni-ball is high quality, at very reasonable prices.
Thanks jetpens, now I'm hooked and will never buy from office depot or staples
again. :)"
tiffanykiok,"October 7, 2011","Excellent pen...I was originally unsure of whether to buy this pen or the 0.28mm
version. I am glad I chose the 0.38mm thickness because it's very thin (but not
too thin) and doesn't skip. It writes clearly with sharp precision, and the pen
itself feels comfortable to write with. Black pigmentation is good and doesn't
appear faded."
deathkiller79808,"August 3, 2011",The pen was everything i could have hoped for. It writes perfectly.
hippocheese14,"June 9, 2011","First things first:The pen writes incredibly smoothly and the tip is a lot more durable when
compared against other lines such as the popular Pilot Hi-Tec-C.The rubber grip makes extended writing a little more bearable, but it is not all
that effective, and I feel that the grip is placed a little too high for my
writing style. Now the problem:No matter how orders of this pen I make, the pen begins to skip after merely a
few days of usage. I try my hardest to avoid getting anything stuck within the
tip of the pen to cause any skipping, but the problem seems to be inevitable and
it's quite a nuisance. It's a huge problem, so it detracts one point from my
review."
bugscottiebug,"April 1, 2011","This pen is amazing. Compared to some other .38s that barely write, this pen is
incredibly smooth and amazingly sharp."
kjiempreecha,"January 5, 2011","Excellent writing quality when it works, but as the previous reviewers
mentioned, if you drop the pen onto a a hard surface, there is a very, very high
chance that it will not work as well when you pick it back up. The tip appears
to be easily damaged or something because if you try to draw a spiral with a pen
that you dropped on the tip parts of it will consistently not show up. The ink
glob problem can also occur after you drop the pen. It's a great pen if you are
careful."
hippocheese14,"October 24, 2010","Short:This pen writes incredibly well. Long:Out of the three pens I ordered (Hi-Tec-C, Signo DX), this is my favorite to
write with. The grip works with my fingers well, the pen tip doesn't skip or dry
out, and it's my favourite one for my Lab Notebook in Chemistry class; the other
two I fear may tear the paper if I write hard.I'm sad to say that I lost the cap while walking around on a field trip, but as
a pen-lover, I ordered another Black and a Blue compliment it."
ebenfatto,"September 2, 2010","This has already become one of my favorite pens -- even compared to many of the
high-end fountain pens I also use. (Blasphemy, I know. But these Signo's are
just that good.) My Hi-Tech-C pens feel quite scratchy in comparison. Also, my
Hi-Tech-C's tend to have ink build up at the tip and then glop onto the
beginning of a pen stroke. I've -never- seen that happen with my Signo's. I was
quite sorry that I'd put my money into a collection of Hi-Tech-C's before trying
these."
chris.pantoja,"August 19, 2010","I love the way Uni-ball pens write! This pen is simply a great choice. I tried
my friend's Hi-Tec-C and although it wrote good, the Uni-ball's tip is what
keeps me coming back. This pen is great for sketching and taking notes."
zhou_shelly,"December 2, 2009","This pen is AMAZING! But, there is one downside to it. Because I'm a student, I
am constantly highlighting the important details in my notes. And, these pens
just came in today along with my Kokuyo Beetle Tip Highlighters. So, I put these
pens to the test (since most of my pens whenever I highlight, the ink smudges
the direction I highlight) and sadly, it this ink smudged too. And also, I
waited about 10 minutes or so before I highlighted. Other than that, the barrel
is amazing and so is the quality of the ink flow!"
idriveajeed,"October 28, 2009","Absolutely delightful. Very smooth, very crisp. Nice sturdy tip. I would
otherwise be using a Pilot Hi-Tec C (ever so slightly darker and smoother, in my
opinion) if not for their needle tips, which bend after being dropped. Okay, so
maybe I shouldn't drop my pen, but sometimes, it can't be helped. If you're looking for quality writing to be coveted by all (people keep
snatching this one when I'm not looking), this pen is the promised land. Pick up
a pack of 10. These disappear quickly."
bluemagister,"September 1, 2009","I brought home a box of these in 0.38mm and 20 refills from Japan. They are the greatest pen the world has ever known. A PERFECT gel line, dark,
solvent proof and permanent. Smooth, easy to handle and the tip is MUCH sturdier
than the finicky Hi-Tec C line. 0.38mm is perfect for me and I will always carry one wherever I go."

tyleraspect,"September 13, 2008","This is a very nice pen. The black ink is rendered thin and precise with no ink
blotches. The pen glides well on paper, considering its 0.38 mm size. The
rubberized grip is hard, but functions acceptably."
hartzog2000,"August 28, 2008","I like these pens. The ink is nice and black and goes onto the paper evenly. The
have a nice tapering nib that makes for a strong tip. They have a rubber grip
that is not to soft and feels good in my hand. The cap is short and when on the
back of the pen does not rest in the web of my hand. The pens have good balance
allowing for long writing periods.  The 0.28mm nib drags the worst of the 2 sizes but leaves the thinner line. The
0.38mm nib writes the smoothest but produces a darker line. The 0.38mm nib is
perhaps the better of the two as an every day pen. It writes as smooth as any
other uni-ball 0.38mm gel pen."

jennyzhu2005,"April 12, 2013","I really love this pen. The ink is very dark and smooth and it writes more
comfortably than similar pens like the hi ted c. However, i am giving this low
points because the pen is more fragile than it seems and breaks with the first
drop. I have had several of these pens and none of them are working anymore
because the nib of the pen has been pushed in because of a little drop. People
think that this pen is less fragile than the hi tec c with the really thin nib
but that is not true. The nib of the hi tec c is actually quite sturdy. Although
the nib on the signo may seem sturdier because it is thicker and heaver, the
heaviness of it actually causes it to be more easily broken when dropped because
of the weight it puts on the tip. I have dropped my hi tec cs multiple times and
even if the tip because crooked it still works better than my signos that barely
let out ink anymore."

paper.On ""cheap-er"" paper like those composition notebooks you get from Walmart, the
pen starts to feel scratcy and it won't write."
limnidytis,"February 25, 2010","Nice pen. Good in the beginning but then fades. Very smooth. Ball seems loose
though, as if you leave the pen pointed down, a blob of ink will collect and
then when you start writing it will blob out on the paper. I fill out
pre-printed forms, and the balls seem to be abraded or damaged by the printing
on the pages. Sometimes between 1/2 and 1/3 use, the ball will jam and I can't
get the pen to write again. Paper on the forms does seem rough. Refills seem to
have more problems along this line, but maybe I'm just imagining they are more
fragile. If you drop the pen on the point, it will definitely kill the pen."
restlesscourage,"October 7, 2015","I bought this pen for longer writing sessions, the sort where long pauses had me
shaking my other pens to get them going again. I figured the retractable nib
would be better for this than needing to remember to cap/uncap the pen.The verdict: I love this pen so much! I was on the fence for a long time about
getting one (mostly because of the cost), but I have to say I have zero buyer's
remorse now that I've had it a few weeks. I loaded it up immediately with some
Pilot Iroshizuku Yama-Budo, and it writes like a dream. There's a little
feedback, but not much -- certainly not enough that I'd call it ""scratchy"", by
any means.If you've got the cash to spare, it's definitely a worthwhile investment!"
Mai Anh,"May 26, 2015","This review is written off first impressions and a full day of use. I will
revise this review if extended and continued use changes my opinion. Let me also
qualify my review. This is my first fountain pen. I cannot compare it to other
fountain pens. I CAN, however, compare it to other fine writing instruments. My
favorite, to date, has been the Pilot Hi-Tec C Cavalier pens. Japanese pens tend
to be the only ones fine enough to accommodate my handwriting, so I have stuck
with them. Let me first speak to the appearance of the pen. The matte black is
very contemporary, sleek, and attractive. I can see how it might scuff easily,
but I have not had that problem as of yet. the pen comes with the rhodium nib
which is a gunmetal gray color.Now, to the real meat of the review. This pen writes BEAUTIFULLY. The flow is
continuous but efficient. It neither skips nor blots. You DO have to be very
gentle with your pressure against the paper, but my opinion is that all fountain
pens must be this way, given the nature of the ink delivery. The clip is in a
reverse position, which is a subtle but great design to help with function and
to prevent potential leaks (of which I have had none). The pen is a GREAT
weight. I do not like plastic pens. I like a heavier pen that pushes your
strokes to be more deliberate. That being said, this pen is not too heavy. I
don't get tired holding it for extended periods of time, and it is wide enough
that gripping it doesn't cause my hand to cramp too quickly.I switched the converter out for the CON-20, a squeeze converter. I like this
converter quite a bit. I filled it with Diamine Blue-Black, which I find flows
well, has yet to dry on me, and with a rich color. It has not clogged my nib
yet. The price point for this pen is quite high, but if you write as much as I
do or enjoy writing as much as I do, then you will find this very worth the
money. You can instantly tell it is made of high quality materials, and was
designed with a great deal of thought. I love that the nib is retractable.As it compares to Hi-Tec C pen refills, easily the most popular pen in Asia, the
Extra Fine nib is on very close to the 0.3mm, but it is not too scratchy. The
nib is JUST a hair thicker than the 0.3 (close to 0.35mm?). The pen is
approximately 4.5 inches long when retracted.I am exceptionally happy with this purchase. I will be trying the pen with Pilot
Iroshizuku Bottled Fountain Pen Ink, Shin-Kai - Deep Sea AND Deep Azure,
Noodler's Midnight Blue, and J. Herbin Black."
FP dilettante,"July 3, 2015","Let me first qualify I'm new to fountain pens and this is my second one.  My
first pen was a Kaweco Sport Classic EF.  When they say this Pilot is EF boy is
it ever!  It's like writing with a pin needle.  I have small handwriting so I
like the EF nibs but this one is just a little too fine.  The Kaweco on the
other hand writes beautifully.  I did some reading before buying the Pilot and I
understood the difference between Western and Japanese nibs.  Now I know first
hand the difference 0.2mm can make.  I was originally contemplating this Pilot
with a fine nib and I regret not going that route.  The pen itself is
beautifully crafted but just throwing out a warning on this super extra fine
nib.  If I could got back I would opt for the fine nib.  "
jasimhaw,"June 7, 2018","This pen serves me very well as the main companion for my Hobonichi planner.
It's the finest nib I've ever used, yet it's smoother than some larger nibs
(like my Lamy EF). I used it for a while with a converter, but I've found I like
using it best with a Pilot cartridge that I refill with a syringe.I ink it with Noodler's Polar Green, which is a tricky ink to work with. This is
probably one of the few nibs that lays down just enough ink so that it doesn't
bleed or feather through the Tomoe River paper in my planner. (Disclaimer: that
won't be an issue with any other kind of ink. It's just because that particular
ink is designed to be very absorbent, even on fountain-pen friendly paper, in
order to be fast drying.)Best of all, I love the feeling of this pen in my hand. It's sturdy and has
excellent weight distribution, which allows me to barely grip it to get ink on
the page. This gives my hands a nice break, since I tend more towards a natural
death grip. I've had no issues whatsoever with the clip being part of the grip.
I've actually found that it helps me pick up the pen and spin it to the proper
writing position without looking, which is great for fast notes in meetings or
while studying since I don't need to break my concentration. I think I've found my holy-grail daily writer. "
layaansajid,"May 19, 2016","I have to say this is an excellent pen; it's incredibly smooth for such an extra
fine Nib.  I only use Levenger Circa Notebooks and order my papers from them, so
I have no idea what it's like to extensively use this pen with a different paper
quality. Also, this pen is paired with the Iroshizuku Ink by Pilot, in a
Yama-budo color. The ink flow is even, consistent, and dries instantly with no
smudging; the nib is always fresh even when I leave it overnight, and yes, I use
highlighters over the ink, and it does not bleed (sweet!).  I have to admit, the
experience is incredible, and will recommend this to anyone looking for this
type of fountain pen.  I am an auditor and the extra fine Nib allow that I
document precisely in very tight spaces, it is a dream, the only challenge is, I
need to keep the other auditors away from it, at this price tag, they will need
to get their own, sorry no sharing!"
roshan.k.sinha,"December 20, 2015","I've only been using this pen for a couple of weeks, but so far, this pen is
amazing! Extremely smooth and the nib really is extra fine. Also, the pen
doesn't leak at all. One thing to note is that the ink in the cartridge that
came with the pen didn't flow. I tossed it and have been using namiki cartridges
that have been fantastic."
taozi,"December 23, 2021","ordered this in 2016, it's lasted me throughout all of college. it runs
smoothly, and the weight is very comfortable for notetaking. the clip seems like
it would get in the way but actually it's helped a lot with my grip and it
doesn't feel awkward at all."
salotta59,"December 29, 2015","Phenomenal pen. Owned one for more than 15 years but had to replace through an
unfortunate incident. I won't consider another brand. great for sketching!"
vkatelynh,"March 8, 2020","I love this pen! It is my go-to now.I love the finish, the weight, and the nib. I got the EF and it feels like
writing with a needle, which I prefer. The clip isn't bothersome for me when
writing.I bought a decimo before buying this (I'm female w/ small hands), but I honestly
wish I would've gotten this one first as I prefer it over my decimo. My only complaint is the CON-40 converter. The converter doesn't work (won't
pull up ink) on my VP nor Decimo, but that is a Pilot issue, not a JetPens
issue. I have to use a syringe to fill the converter. "
EBSmail2,"March 28, 2016","I have to say that at first I was second-guessing my purchase, because it took a
rather significant effort to get the ink flowing (I was using a cartridge, not
the converter it came with), and I never had this problem with the medium nib
Vanishing Point I already owned.  Once the words appeared on paper, however, I
was more than pleased with this pen's performance.  The flow is clean and
steady, allowing for crisp, precise writing. I may need to purchase the fine
point as well, to round out my collection!"
loewiness,"August 31, 2015","This is hands down the best pen I've ever had my hands on. Smooth, hardcore,
awesome! "
ATAT,"June 21, 2021","MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE FOUNTAIN PEN! ...to write, to scribble, to doodle, to
sketch! Very reliable mechanics, does not dry out easily and if it once does
so,... no problem to clean the nib,...but be careful when opening it; the coil
spring may shoot the nib out just like a dart arrow, ... I already ""lost"" one
that way"
techbf0914,"February 26, 2017","Wow, beautiful pen. Slightly lighter then I expected, writes with a slight
amount of feedback, but the extra fine is definitely very fine, better suited
for people who like to write small and precise, the line is very thin. I own a
twsbi vac mini and some lamy pens, so this was a big jump in quality for me.
This is the most versatile pen I own now and I will use it for most of my
writing. Being able to click it open like a ballpoint makes it the pen I pick up
most of the time and want to write with. Quality is exceptional and the finish on this is so good, I will baby this pen
when taking it with me. A glossy metal finish would be easier to use if you want
a more rough and tumble pen. I haven't even noticed the grip being in the way
when I pick it up to write, and it corrects your grip on the pen sub consciously
to position the nib right. No cons, except potentially if I wanted to use this as a pen I carry in my jeans
pocket. I have a brass kaweco for that, I would carry this in a case or put it
in a jacket pocket for more protection.   "
tracy.punshon,"May 23, 2016","I bought this pen with the intention of using it as a drawing pen for my line
and wash drawings. And I was excited to have a pen that would fly under the
radar as a fountain pen. I usually buy extra-fine nibs, but this is certainly
the finest extra-fine I have (I own Lamy, Sheaffer and Faber Castell pens).
Miraculously, it delivers the kind of line width I hoped for. The nib is smooth
with a perfect moisture level. I have small hands, but the size and grip were
very comfortable. I did several line drawings with it yesterday and it was
outstanding. No skips, no hard starts, and the nib stays wet for far longer. I
am now looking into waterproof and fountain pen friendly drawing inks to put in
it. "
josephnoteboom,"May 17, 2016","I really love the fact it retracts. It keeps me from capping my pen 20 times in
a meeting. It is a little light and feels small in my hands. The clip at the
bottom will take some getting used to, but it's a good pen overall. Also, this
pen in XF is very fine, like .25mm to .3mm, but flows excellent with no skips. I
did use the Pilot Iroshizuku Tak-su I Ink with the supplied converter."
huppy3000,"April 26, 2022","This is my absolute favorite pen! The nib writes very smoothly, even though it
writes very fine. "

point in my collection."
acceber2184,"May 15, 2021",I purchased this pen and love it however I purchased black and got blue ink 
squintyemonster,"March 27, 2021","My pen started out scratchy at first but after using it regularly for a few days
it smoothed out and I enjoy using this Fountain pen so much. The extra fine
helps me write really small which is perfect for my hobonichi. Definitely
recommend this fountain pen but make sure you know what size nib you want/enjoy
writing with. The extra fine writes like a .3mm pen."
Cassandra Mortmain,"November 11, 2020","I got my first proper fountain pen in high school (Sailor/from a Japanese
friend) - Since then I have owned several Waterman, a Lamy, a Pelikan, Cross,
Parker— but the BEST fountain pen I have ever owned is my Vanishing Point- I
got my first one in the 90s & have never looked back: ink flow is consistent,
they never leak, the nibs are never scratchy— and come on! How cool is it to
pull one out a meeting? And not dealing with a cap? Find the best nib for your
writing style and you will never look back— it will be a constant. And they
are beautifully designed objects, top of the line."
BZMacL,"October 27, 2020","This is the best stealth fountain pen.  The nib is fine enough to fill in forms
with undersized blanks or to draw fine detail.  The the retraction mechanism
means that the ink almost never dries out. The matte black metal finish feels
good in the hand and even looks stealthy.The ultra-fine nib does produce some resistance and sound on most paper.  If you
don't like any noise from a pen or you want extreme smoothness, this may not be
the pen you want.  I, like some other reviewers, have found that the filler
mechanism in the converter does not entirely fill the ink chamber.  I use the
converter anyway because the line is so fine that the pen goes a long time
between refills.  However, I wish Pilot would use a more satisfactory converter."
nilufarkamdar7,"October 9, 2020",Love this Pilot fountain pen. I love everything fountain pen. 
nils.michals,"July 29, 2020","Finally a fountain pen that is truly extra fine! Writes very thin for my small
handwriting. "
KTinNYC,"November 23, 2019","AMAZINGI adore this pen. It is SO comfortable, cleverly designed, and GORGEOUS! I
haven't figured out how to use it with refillable cartridges, but it works quite
well with the disposable ones. I learned the hard way that if you haven't used
it in awhile, you do have to wash the whole thing out before putting in a new
cartridge or it won't work due to the tip being gunked up- but that's just the
way of fountain pens. So far, the only downside is the price- which is actually
reasonable given the engineering and gorgeousness. But, considering I lose such
things occasionally, it is slightly painful to pay that price again- which I've
done, that's how much I love this. It's still not my go-to pen for daily
professional writing, but that's also just the nature of fountain pens, as they
don't work well on regular paper. "
mauricioseiti,"February 12, 2019",one of the best pens of my collection. i have several of these... 
lexigerv,"June 6, 2016","LOVE ITTTTTI know my opinion may be a little skewed since this is the most expensive pen I
have yet to buy, but I love it. The matte black is a nice, smooth finish, that I
am told may chip with time, but for now remains pristine (truth be told I would
not mind a little chipping)The nib is smooth with some line variation and flows well even when reverse
writing. I am buying a leather pen case to protect my new baby and the whole
retractable feature is something I craved since the beginning of my fountain pen
journey.Buy it!"
markusmuelller,"August 3, 2022","I bought a special edition Guilloche Link matte pen quite some time ago. I
believe this pen to be a total misconstruction. It is beautiful and the
mechanism is fascinating but only if you do not intend to use it. As I rotate
many pens and even more pencils one has to take into consideration that if you
do not use this pen constantly, have it rest a couple of days, you basically
have to invest at least an hour to get it to function again. It dries up and
there is no ink-flow unless you rinse, fill up etc. etc., again and again. A lot
of blue fingers and no fun. Wast of money and again it just does not do the job.
My Pelikan, Lamy, and Kaweco have no problems performing."
dianabosworth,"February 1, 2012","This is an edit of my previous 4 star review.  After doing a bit of research and testing other VP products, the converter is
indeed supposed to leave a bit of air, and is working correctly.  I have been using this as my primary writting insturment for months and love it
more every day. The quality is impecable.  The only issue I've had was some minor (I mean just a few drops) leaking when I
flew on 4 different airplanes with a full converter. I would expect this from
such frequent changes in pressure, and now just put it in a plastic bag with a
tissue around the nib end or empty the converter before a flight."
johnmullins,"July 5, 2012","If I was going to be sensible (which I'm not), I'd stop buying fountain pens
right now, because this one is perfect for me. Writes smoothly, ready to go in
an instant, looks fantastic. A bit of advice on the converter...I found that the
Pilot CON-20 squeeze type converter works better for me, and is well worth the
couple of extra dollars. I get a good fill with no hassle every time."
ecarracao,"May 29, 2013","I have been using this pen for a few weeks now, and all I can say is ""wow"".  The
nib so smooth, and it never skips... it almost seems intuitive as it glides
across paper.  As handsome as it is, it is a performance pen! The body is metallic and dense, and so there is a helpful amount of weight in
the pen to help balance your hand as you write.  And the retractable nib is a
marvel in its own right.  The push-button nib clicks, extends, and contracts
like a cheap disposable pen would, but with the Pilot, it almost feels like your
pressing the launch button on a space vehicle, as the nib comes out of its
shudder with such pleasurable ease. The matte black Pilot VP is so elegantly designed, and so functional, that it
seems like more than just a pen.  To me, it is a small treasure."
dianabosworth,"October 25, 2011","This was a birthday gift from my mom. It is a beautiful pen. It writes smoothly
and is well balanced. The point is very fine. I would estimate that is is around
a 0.4 I took off a star because the converter is not air tight so it only fills
partially with well ink; and putting on the cartridges takes a bit of muscle.  I anticipate this being my go to pen for years to come because of the one-handed
operation and the quality. "
Jimmysquarefoot101,"December 27, 2015","Take a fountain pen nib and a retractable mechanism = the ultimate quick draw
reusable stylish pen. I don't know why this took me so long to finally get- oh
wait now I remember. The position of the clip, but honestly after a few lines of
writing, I adjust and then I don't seem to really notice the clip hump.  But seriously for quick (or long) notes on hand, this is truly ingenious. 
Especially if you're taking notes and you have breaks where you're not writing,
this is nice because you can quickly retract the nib when needed to jot
something down.   The nib...I thought I'd try, this is really one of my first
fine Japanese nibs, since I usually write with broad nibs, I thought for this
I'll try a fine nib...and it's not bad.  Very smooth and wet, it has a nice
consistent flow, but I am thinking about getting a broad replacement, just
because I do prefer broad nibs.But really straight out of the box, the fine is
quite nice and surprisingly smooth.  Glad I finally got this and especially like
that it came with the ink converter.  Worth every penny."
tweedy708,"January 5, 2016","This is by far the best fountain pen I have ever owned.  It is great for daily
use.  I was a bit cautious at first due to the clip being at the end where the
nib is for writing, but I found that the clip actually helps greatly in grasping
the pen when writing.  I also like that A.) it does not leak, even when dropped
and B.) it doesn't dry up when left over night or for a couple days without
writing."
smithl325749,"January 15, 2018","Love the Pilot vanishing pens.  My only complaint is that the casing begins to
look crappy.  I carry all of my pens in a leather case, but when I put this next
to one of my other metal fountain pens the black matte finish began to chip;
thus, the pen looks crappy but works perfectly."
d.ryan.mckinney,"June 6, 2016","Most amazing purchase! Shipped in the allotted time, came impeccably wrapped,
two layers of bubble envelopes. This is my first fountain pen purchase, and I
use it daily. Stealth, but if someone recognizes it, they will comment.
Cartridge that came with it was a bit leaky, but nothing to fault thepen for at
all. Once my coworker showed me the refilling ease of the included converter, I
was hooked. Writing for no reason at all. Exaggeratedly pulling out from my
chest pocket just to get that satisfying click. Using it to sign credit receipts
at bars, even when provided with one. Also, the price I got this pen for,
including two-day shipping across the country, was cheaper than any other brand
new Matte Black VP I could find, especially in a fine nib. Speaking of nibs, it
works fine for me on all but the cheapest papers.  My advice, if this pen has
been tempting you, bite the bullet. I have no doubt in my mind I will carry this
pen for the rest of my natural life. PS - The clip will not get in your grip's way at all. "
sumertiwari,"March 15, 2019","WOW!If you could ever buy 1 fountain pen, make sure it is THIS!Gold nib is definitely a big step up from Steel nibs for me. There's just something about it (other than being 7 times expensive). that makes
it special. No matter how fast I do my signature, this pen doesn't breath. No
scratchiness whatsoever.I was contemplating between this and LAMY 2000. I read a review on LAMY 2000
that it felt scratchy. I wasn't ready to spend this much to feel the same
""scratchiness"" that I feel with LAMY Safari.  I decided to go with Vanishing
point and I am so glad I did.I am spending my weekend writing with this pen. "

lyndal,"August 12, 2016","I LOVE this pen. I bought this pen to use at work with a waterproof ink, and
after a few months of use dropped it on the nib.While I waited for it to be repaired, I bought a standard Lamy which gave me
nothing but grief when paired with waterproof inks (I used Diamine, Noodlers,
and Mont Blanc). Constantly clagging up after a minute of use.Once the Pilot returned it's been smooth sailing, with only the occasional
hiccup needing the ink to be coaxed to flow again.Perfect pen for everyday use, worth it for the money."
jenel,"March 18, 2016","Love it.  Use it every day and everyone I show it to wants one too.  The fine
nib is VERY fine, but it is smooth, so even though a bit finer than I expected,

out-performs my $500 Montblanc, so I guess that says it all."
paulsaini,"April 22, 2015","A-W-E-S-O-M-E.  This is my first fine pen and it write like a dream.  At first I
was regretting getting the fine nib, but as the days passed, I started to
appreciate its precision.  I work in finance and have a lot of client facing
where I need to take notes.  This helps set the tone for the professional
meeting (everyone stares at it).  Works well for taking notes, but I would get a
medium nib if you plan on writing anything more.I've read that the matte finish can suffer from scratches, so I baby mine. 
Hoping to avoid any major dings!.I'm already trying to decide which Vanishing Point I get next! ;P"

better on shikkari paper and others on sarasara paper)."
xtaing,"January 3, 2023","This sampler was perfect for me as I wanted to get some new fine tip pens, but I
didn't know which ones to go with. Loved being able to try out various brands
and sizes even if I didn't end up enjoying them all. The Pilot Hi-Tec-C Gel Pen
- 0.3 mm - Black ended up my personal favorite!"
PBODYMLI,"September 24, 2022","The Pilot G-2 0.38 has been my favorite pen for years and I’m always stocked
up on them. This set just opened up a whole new world to me because I’ve never
seen gel pens in 0.38, 0.35, let a lot 0.3! How am I ever going to just pick one
as my new favorite? My first impressions with them all is beyond what I
expected! "

MelT,"June 7, 2022","I definitely would re-order this set again.  This Sampler allowed me to try
different pens and sizes I never thought I'd love.  I usually stick to 0.5mm but
now my favorite is 0.38 uniball signo and 0.4 juice up pens. I ended up buying
all the colors"
MarieL,"May 18, 2022","I didn’t like some of the pens in this sampler pack either.  Some of them had
points that were too thin that made it hard for me to write with. "
sandypadron91,"April 12, 2022","Although these are fine tip, the ink flows every nicely and smoothly. Sometimes
when using fine tip pens, the ink sometimes doesn't come out right and the

stormdottir,"January 26, 2022","I was searching for a replacement for a Japanese fine point pen I could no

favorites out of the selection I was sent. If you're not sure what kind of pen

cegraham14,"March 11, 2020","I loved all of the pens in this sampler aside from the Sakura and the Frixion.
The Sakura skipped over multiple different paper types and was not a pleasant
experience. The Frixion is much too light to be called true black ink, and I
love rich black ink for writing.Otherwise, I have loved experimenting and trying out the different pens in this
sampler!"

now but enjoy writing with them and have them stashed around the house for
everyday use. I found a couple of pens that I really like so far and those may
be the ones that I buy again. Overall this was a great value for trying out

personal preference on how “scratchy” these pens feel. "
lescase,"May 27, 2021","The majority of pens in this sampler were not to my liking, despite glowing
reviews.  I found one decent pen (though still not as good as the pen I already
use).  The rest went straight to the trash can.  I understand that one of the
points of sampler packs is to learn what you DON'T like, but I was hoping to
find a few more that were tolerable."

jaynezh2003,"June 1, 2022","This is definitely a pretty pen hence 2 stars for the look. But the rest is
disappointing. I bought a Kaweco Sport EF in green before and it writes
smoothly. It's one of my fav fountain pens. So this time I wanted to try Kaweco
in Fine. I have to say I am disappointed. It feels scratchy and dry. Ink flows
unsmoothly and unevenly. I tried different kinds of paper surfaces but none of
them worked well with this pen."
FrancineHibiscus,"March 30, 2022","I will be honest, I got this for the iridescent finish.  It does not disappoint!
 The resin is translucent, and the color change is subtle and lovely."
Love Tomoe River,"April 5, 2022","Beautiful pen.  I am so happy I was able to get my hands on this as it sold out.
 The fine is a bit scratchy.  Still getting used to different nib sizes in the
fountain pen world.  Perhaps next time I'll try a medium nib with this brand.  "
sarasaland,"May 13, 2022",i am a proud owner of this beauty... makes me happy just looking at it
jastone108,"April 8, 2022","This was my first Kaweco fountain pen but it won't be my last. I'm in awe that
this pen was so inexpensive. It's incredibly beautiful, but it's all about
performance. This pen writes so smoothly, the ink flows quickly after the
cartridge was inserted. I haven't used this for very long but so far it's
impressive. "
mscandicegale,"April 29, 2022","I had to have this pen just like many others from Kaweco. The color is beautiful
and the quality never misses. Jet Pens has quick shipping so I didn’t have to
wait long for it to be in my hands. This is currently my purse pen."
kjperp,"November 26, 2022","Looks and feels kind of like something you would win out of a claw machine. Some
folks might like the featherweight feel of this pen but it's not really for me.
This may sound silly but capping and uncapping the pen brings me no joy. The
good news is the nib writes nice and smooth. I can see why people like these
pens but this will most likely be my first and last Kaweco Sport."
Bella Marie,"October 2, 2022","Super pretty! If you look up any videos of it you will see how it moves in the
light. I really like the nib's writing quality, feels really smooth and lets out
wetter inks really nicely! I also like that I can exchange the nib size and
clean out the feed. I'm rating it 5 stars because it's a high quality pen that
writes well, feels nice, and looks beautiful!I have some cons that are personal for me but maybe would be useful information
to others:~ I hold my pens the ""lateral tripod"" way so the threading at the grip digs into
my finger and doesn't offer the support I'm used to feeling in capped fountain
pens.~ This pen is a bit small and I usually fit in medium sized gloves so it's just
a little short for me even with the cap on the end."
salemstreetbb,"September 13, 2022","I like my new Kaweco pen. It's similar to one I already had, but it's smaller or
rather shorter, so it doesn't fit in the hand quite as nicely. It works the same
and writes smoothly. "
kqnnguyen0,"September 4, 2022","Bought one of these for myself and I'm using it along with my Hobonichi Techo,
and it is an absolute delight.  One thing I didn't realized was how small the
pen was, but now it makes sense why so many people recommended it to me as
something I could carry around in my pocket!  I also got one for my friends and
after trying this out, I am sure they'll love it as a gift as well!  "
JC Lee,"September 3, 2022","The Kaweco Liliput (EF) was a recent purchase for my small travelers notebook,
and its performance was pleasing enough that I wanted to try this iridescent
pearl sport pen (F).  Alas.  The one that I received has ink flow issues, dry
starts, and is tiring to write with - it does not glide across the paper (Rhodia
notepad and Traveler's Co. Notebooks) - one really has to think about finding
the correct combination of angle/pressure for the nib. It is a functional
fountain pen, but far from a pleasure to use for note-taking. I've cleaned it
twice with water and a bit of dish soap - no improvement. Today I wrote a page
and was relieved when I capped it and put it down.  I'll keep trying to break it
in, but will avoid Kaweco in the future.  The inexpensive Pilot fountain pens
just seem more consistent."
wrathandwriting,"September 2, 2022","As a writer Im obsessed with all types of writing implements. I also love
iridescent so this was a no brainer. It's compact and cute. It reminds me of one
I bought and lost on a trip to England years ago so this find makes me happy.
Lately Ive been using my fountains for drawing and I'm happy to add this and the
lavender one to my collection.  It writes well. I usually like thicker nibs but
I wanted the fine and extra fine so I can concentrate on smaller lines. I love
it."

LaLa,"July 13, 2022","I got the Kaweco iridescent pearl F nib and I absolutely love this pen. My first
Sport and it is gorgeous! The color is stunning and the nib is perfect size for
writing in my Hobonichi Weeks. I have small hands and this is a very comfortable
pen for me to hold. I think I would like a slightly thicker nib though, so
another Sport with a M nib might be in my future… I also have a Kaweco Perkeo
in F and I feel like my Sport F writes just a little bit thicker and smoother
than the Perkeo. I use Kaweco ink cartridges. "
jastone108,"June 18, 2022","This is a such a pretty little pen and writes beautifully. The price and quality
are incredible. I like writing with this pen as much as some of my pens that
cost 6-10x the price. I have small hands, so the size is great for me, but for
someone with smaller hands, size could be a drawback. "
madd,"June 14, 2022","This pen is super pretty (even more than the pictures!) and writes smoothly with
only a little bit of drag when compared to a medium nib."

drawingalot,"June 8, 2022","I own this pen and I recommend purchasing a clip for it. After using it for a
bit--it writes like a dream. If you're used to Japanese pens like me you might
prefer the fine though. I am considering buying an EF and swapping the nibs. It is slightly translucent as pictured. But not totally.This is a ridiculously shiny pen. I have definitely pulled it out at meetings
and had people look at it, haha. I bought it because it looks purple and blue at
the same time and put diamine turquoise in it. Lovely!"
bujo.doctor,"June 1, 2022","I love this pen! I didn't plan on getting one at first but I kept seeing
everyone's reviews and I just had to have it. The fine nib is a nice change from
the EF which I usually prefer."
joanntsuge,"May 1, 2022",It writes really smooth. 
emilylovan25,"January 10, 2023","This is by far my favorite fountain pen. It writes so smooth and is very easy to

much smudging as I do with some pens. And the iridescent body is beautiful!!! I
want to take this everywhere with me! "

asherr.ren,"October 26, 2022","I had originally purchased this pen for the look and to use as a last option-

one of my everyday pens"
queenm2770,"June 8, 2022",See review for Cyan pen.
JC Lo,"August 16, 2018","It’s time to reveal the big secret.This pen takes MANY kinds of refills. You don’t have to use the included
Jetstream ink. Chances are if your favorite refill looks like what’s included,
you might get it to fit, either directly or with some minor tweaking.Compatible refills include:1. Uni SXN (Jetstream)2. Zebra JF (Sarasa)3. Pentel LRN5 (Energel)4. Pilot BRFV (Acroball)5. Uni UMR-85 (Signo)If we were all as accepting as this pen barrel then there will no longer be wars
on this planet.Definitely check the dimensions before you buy these alternative refills though."
trvsdnhm,"May 11, 2011","I just received mine and I love it ^^ Here\'s some pros/cons of the pen: Pros:- Jetstream = super nice for a ballpoint pen- alpha gel grip (it takes 1-2 days to \""break in\"" but once it\'s broken in,
the grip will feel like the grip from the alpha gel original series.same texture
and squish- refillable: i definitely wanted a pen which i could refill. why pay for a pen
body if you can\'t refill it ~shrug~ anyways...the refills cost $ and reviews
say that the blue refill sucks soooo we\'ll see. I bought an extra black refill
just in case.- METAL! xD feels good. the end/body of the pen is skinnier than expected. Cons:- Grip\'s a dirt/fuzz magnet more so than the other grips. (see below for a fuzz
rating xD) I put a touch of hand cream on the grip and rubbed it in. I do this
for all of my alpha gel grips because it helps to break the grip in faster and
keeps the grip slick enough so that dirt/fuzz doesn\'t cling to it.- it\'s a ballpoint....but one of the better ones Side Notes: - The Zebra B2A1 is a nice full metal (duel color) ballpoint as well. I actually
prefer to use the zebra to write on binder paper over the uni jetstream.- This being said...the $$ really?.... -____- whatever- I also bought the full-rubber grip jetstream and in my opinion, from a visual
standpoint, the rubber jetstream looks a ton sicker than the alpha gel one.
It\'s not how the pen looks laying on a table...it\'s how it looks in your hand
when you\'re writing w/it."
weir.jared,"July 4, 2011","Excellent Pen!  I sadly had to reorder it as mine went missing, and I only hope
the new owner appreciates it as much as I did.  I was already in love with the
Jetstream ink, but the marriage with Alpha Gel makes it that much better.  I
can't stress enough how much I love it!"
bspotts,"March 6, 2013","Just ordered this pen, and as usual Jet Pens delivered on time as ordered. I am
delighted with this pen, find the comfort and balance to be ideal, particularly
for long writing sessions. I am a prolific note taker in business situations,
and this is now my go to pen. Upon receiving the pen, I changed the refill
cartridge from the .7MM that came in the pen to a 1.0MM that suits my style
better. Standard Uni-Ball refills work just fine, and they are excellent to
write with. The gel grip is very comfortable, and suits my writing style very
well. It does tend to be a lint and dust magnet, but I rubbed it down with a
laundry dryer sheet, and that removed the static from the grip and cured the
lint problem. Overall, this is an excellent pen, a little pricey but worth the
money in my opinion. Highly recommended."
unitedbiscuit,"February 14, 2021","I bought this pen at the same time as a Jetstream Premier to compare the two.
This pen is entirely worth the money, especially compared to the flimsy,
cheap-feeling Premier. It's got a beautifully weighted metal body, a luxurious
gel grip, and a satisfying click. I traded the 0.7mm ink tip for a 1.0mm tip due
to personal preference (both felt quite smooth, but I like the look of a bolder
line)Something to note: it's true that the gel grip is a bit of a lint magnet. It's
so freakin' comfortable, though, that I'm willing to overlook it. To me, the
overall aesthetic of the body is so nice that it doesn't really matter. This
immediately became my favorite go-to pen, and I would absolutely consider buying
it again in the future. "
Seth B,"January 2, 2021","Love the body of this pen- in theory. It takes many MANY refills, and I HATED
the Jetstream one that came in it. Took me a very long time to use it up, but I
did move it to a different body. The body of this pen, specifically the gel
section, slid around too much to get a grip on the pen. I would find myself
holding the pen up further than usual to get around this. also the gel would
sometimes slip under the machined part, causing an edge. Not my favorite
overall. "
Ali H,"August 3, 2020","Love, love, love! I have always been a fan of the alpha gel series (I also have
purchased pencils with this grip) and Jetstream is the only ballpoint pen that I
can use without frustration, but I really enjoy being able to use other ink
refills with it. I've tried it with both the Pentel Energel and Zebra Sarasa,
and the fit is perfect!"
trvsdnhm,"May 22, 2011","Just to update my previous review...This has become the top ball point pen in my case. After you get the ink
flowing...it works really well. The grip (after being broken in) is exactly like
that of the alpha gel original series (pencil) cept it\'s just a bit firmer
which is very nice.  I still think the price is a bit steep but ~shrug~ what can you do."
Hovera,"February 17, 2022","Very smooth writing. But gel is quite slippery and thick so my thumb and index
finger will end up pinching the gel (like you are pinching a layer of skin) and
lost the hold of the pen."
davidshead,"January 18, 2022","This pen almost makes me resent other pens.  It feels weighty, it feels solid,
it looks impressive.  I made the mistake of trying the Uni Jetstream Premier but
that pen felt too light weight and the materials did not impress.  With this
Alpha Gel you get a comfortable writing grip, nice materials and textures, and
even better – a large compatibility with refills.  While I enjoy the jetstream
ballpoints I can swap it to a Uni One pigment refill or perhaps a Uni Signo gel
refill.  For me an additional highlight is that the clip is compatible with the
pen loop on the Hobonichi Safari 2 cover; many pens stick up too high and extend
outside of that cover to my annoyance.  Oh, and I like how it clicks."
heidiheidi160,"August 7, 2021",Such a nice grip nice to hold love it 
riew,"April 24, 2021","Excellent pen. Very soft and stable. The only issue was the ink - after using it

richard.rabideau,"April 6, 2021","I am really selective about pens. I write left handed and thus, suffer the

Tuesday,"November 7, 2020","- the ink is super freaking smooth- the pen body has a metal feel to it when you touch it, and it's light- but the squishy grip part collects dust easily"
haesung.yoon,"February 3, 2020","So comfortable to write with! Only downside is the inconsistent ink. I’ve used
3 refills plus the one that came with the pen...all begin to go bad even with
60% plus ink left in the cartridge. "
Yoyochanny,"February 10, 2015","I'm really enjoying this pen! Has a nice weight from the metal body, a
solid-feeling click mechanism and clip, and the gel grip makes it comfortable to
hold for extended periods.  The refill also stays in place so there is no
wobbling or clicking when you're writing.  The grip is indeed a dust magnet, but
just swipe a piece of scotch tape over it to remove any fuzzies!The jetstream refills are buttery smooth for ballpoints, and really are a
pleasure to write with.  I find that the 0.7mm usually has a bit of skipping, so
I'd recommend going for the 0.5mm which feels just a tiny bit scratchier but
usually lays down a more consistent line.Really great overall, and I even keep some of the jetstreams with normal plastic
bodies on hand if I need to loan someone a pen!"
sjager,"November 20, 2014",Writes very nicely and smoothly!
jakedzz,"June 13, 2013","Great if you're looking for a perfect black-ink writing pen. Make sure to get
the black ink refill - the blue it came with skipped so bad it made me want to
toss the pen out, regardless of its price. Glad I didn't!"
Lovegoodpens,"May 29, 2013","Hands-down BEST BALLPOINT ever!!!  I love Uni Jetstream pens but with the Alpha
Gel grip, ultimate pen to have.  I had couple of Uni Alpha Gel HD Ballpoint Pens
the original and thin, but they don't compare to this one.  Jetstream's ink is
smooth and dark, so no need to press down hard.  The ink glides...  And the grip
is soft so my fingers are not tired.  Although the price is up there, it's worth
every $.  Highly recommend."
onevipstar,"February 15, 2013","I really love this pen! The weight is nicely distributed and it's lighter than
it looks like. The alpha gel grip isn't as nice as the other ones (this one is
quite hard), but it still is really nice and comfortable. The ink is very, very good. Really dark and smooth. Cost is a tad too high, but it's totally worth it. "
bossa.tiger,"December 25, 2012","Build quality is superb in fit and finish, metal parts throughout with no feel
of cheapness or play. Barrel has a nice finish and the grip is the shinier but
slightly firmer alpha-gel grip. Refills are the usual Jetstream: great inkflow,
decently smooth. However I'd say that the pen is overpriced and not really worth
it. "
angelplay2,"December 20, 2012","One of my go-to pens -- I like the weight distribution of this pen and the dark,
rich, consistent ink flow. It is basically waterproof (seeps a little yellow
under water but ink does not blur at all). Also I have not noticed excessive
lint on the silicone grip that others have pointed out. It's all around a good
luxury pen and one that I keep my eye on."
j.a.mill130,"January 18, 2012","This is the best ballpoint pen I have ever used. It is true to the uniball
jetstream line, writing just as smooth and easy. The reason I like it more than
the other jetstream pens is because of 1) the grip and 2) it's metal. The grip
is soft yet firm, making it easy to use for long periods. Being metal gives the
pen a nice, professional look. I have it everyday in my front pocket of my dress
shirts. Also, because it's metal it gives a nice weight to the pen, making it
feel more solid and I feel like I write with less force because of it.  A concern I had before purchasing the pen was the weight distribution. From the
pictures it was hard to tell if the larger, grip end would be heavier or the
slimmer, metal end. Having used the pen now, there is no need for concern. The
pen's weight is evenly distributed. If you tried to balance the pen on a finger,
your finger would be on the metal part of the pen, immediately after the gel
grip, in the middle of the pen."
williamscaleba,"January 14, 2009","This pen has excellent build-quality. Nothing seems like it is plastic, or it is
a very persistent knock-off of metal. The pen does not seem as heavy as it looks
in the pictures due to the excellent grip. The ink lays down smoothly, and still
looks like a ballpoint pen."
audreyhwang5,"January 12, 2023","This pen is great for a number of reasons- it writes smoothly, can be refilled
with different sizes, has a good weight to it, and has the perfect grip! "
jacikbrown,"January 2, 2023",The grip is lovely. Uni jetstream has been my #1 ballpoint for years. 
krm2050,"December 27, 2022","Lost this pen and purchase another one.  I really like the pen but I did read
review about the ink drying up fast.  I hope is just a bad batch."
reemas23,"December 25, 2022","This is a great pen! I love the squishy grip, but it does pick up a lot of lint.Also, the 0.7mm included with this pen has a similar line width to the 0.5 mm
Pentel Energel, if you're a fan of that."
kateybabii3,"December 22, 2022","This is pen heaven! I love it, so smooth and satisfying. That’s the best way I
can describe it. "
gabybiscuits,"December 16, 2022","I'm not a big fan of the machined body, as it has a scratcher texture then
expected that makes less comfortable to write with. The pen itself writes fine
but is a little heavy. The alpha gel is on the squishier side of the firmness scale which is quite
comfy. As reported by other reviews tends to collect dust. Unfortunately, I grip
my pens pretty close to the tip which doesn't work great on this model, as the
gel grip doesn't extend far enough forward to support it."
adrie,"December 2, 2022","Bought this as a gift for my left-handed boyfriend to encourage him to work on
his penmanship and it WORKED. He loves it, he ended up ordering 2 more on his
own to keep at home and at work."
Darius Farris,"November 11, 2022","Has become my favorite pen ever I love how smooth it writes.The grip is amazing
because as a person with a lateral grip this makes it so much more comfortable
to write with. The material of the pen feels premium, this has become my daily
writer"
calvaroseann,"November 1, 2022",Smooth and I love it. Will surely order this again. 
poultry.emu_0f,"August 29, 2022",The BODYYYY so squishy and comfortable
georgeh,"July 7, 2022","I was searching for a ballpoint pen and tried a few out. This pen was my
favorite, so much so I ordered a second. The gel grip is larger and very
comfortable. It does not slip in my fingers when writing. The Jetstream in flows
perfectly for me."
Zuri,"July 5, 2022","The BEST ballpoint pen I've ever used, don't think I'll ever use another brand
and model again!"
35usaf,"June 21, 2022","This pen is my deal pen when I sell cars and take notes when speaking to
customers. It is very durable and writes consistent and sharp. The durable
construction was the biggest selling point for me. Japan makes the best pens! "
piptometry,"May 16, 2022","Really excellent weight for my grip type, I only wish I'd found it sooner."
Finn The Human,"May 14, 2022","This is perhaps the best ballpoint pen I've ever written with.I mean it's got the Jetstream refill which I don't even need to mention how good
it is. The metal body is nice and weighty without being too heavy and the silicone grip
is just as amazing as the Premier Signo. Actually this pen is what I wish the
Premier Signo was even though I love that pen.If you want a solid ballpoint pen that you can write for hours with, I can't
recommend it enough!"
vsupervia,"March 24, 2022",can’t go wrong!
alej,"March 2, 2022","I couldn't ask for anything more. The pen itself is great and stylish. Love the
grip, of course--that's what you buy the pen for.The pen works fine with a larger gel refill, if that's what you prefer."
swnk,"February 24, 2022","It works well for people with tight grips on their pens. It makes writing more
comfortable."
torans,"January 29, 2022","Currently my fav writing implement with Pentel Energel 0.5 in blue black.  Yes, this pen fits more refills than listed!"
stinkybug3,"January 26, 2022","I ordered this because I really love the squishy grip of the Uniball Signo 207
premier, but didn't want to get the same exact pen. Now I use this one to
journal, and the other to study. I prefer the Signo premier for studying because
it's lighter, but the weightiness of this one make my journalling sessions feel
more deliberate and fancy. Since these squishy Uni pens came into my life, I
have not used any other pen. The ice cream on the pie is that it is compatible
with many refills, so I can still use my Energels! I'm happy. :3 "

erin,"August 26, 2021","Nice pens with comfortable grip, but I ordered two pens (with lots of refills)
and both ended up breaking within a couple months of use. Now I am stuck with
useless refills and two broken pens. The top of the pen popped off so the pen
won't stay together, this happened to both pens of this model. NOT WORTH THE
MONEY!"

o.jazmin25,"March 20, 2021","Probably my new favorite pen. The grip is very comfortable. I thought the pen
was heavy towards the end but it kinda balances nicely. Pen body is sturdy. Ink
is really smooth "
scottjosue,"March 20, 2021","Love it! I use it at work because I'm constantly writing and all my co-workers
want to take it away from me. It's super comfortable. However, I have to keep it
in a pencase because if I put it in my jean pockets the gel will get dirty. But
I don't mind because I can keep a regular pen in my pocket for quick and short
writings."
scott.alan.anderson.2,"March 18, 2021","This is the most comfortable pen I have ever used.  The grip, the ink, the way
it glides across the paper, all of it is fantastic.  The only thing they could
do to improve it would be to sell it with the 1.0mm ball.  I did order the
replacement insert to swap out.  Buy this.  It is as good as they claim to be."
fmurphy02,"March 10, 2021","MY Uni Jetstream Ballpont Pen writes like Dorthy Hamil used to skate;

antoinettestar,"March 8, 2021","Nice pen, but the Grip attracts all the dust and is hard to keep clean."
Cozen,"February 2, 2021","The only ballpoint pen Ive ever liked. Very easy to write with for long periods

easy to write lines with no skipping or scratching. "
649676388,"January 18, 2021",Really low friction!
andrew01stevens,"January 2, 2021","Okay pen with good balance and awesome ink. Gripping position felt awkward and
causes my wrist to cramp. Grip is nice and squishy, but is a lint magnet. Some
of the paint chipped away at the tip and revealed what looks like brass."
Linschultz,"December 21, 2020",Exactly as described.  Very happy with purchase.
Lucy,"December 21, 2020","I would have potentially given this one star, but it is very comfortable to hold
and write with this pen. However, it blobs ink on every first stroke and in that
way, it doesn't seem much better than what used to happen in the old days of
using a BIC pen. Disappointed."
janemccurdy,"December 11, 2020",Love the look and feel of it!
Laurenvanderkraats,"November 26, 2020","This pen is well-made and weighted well in my hands. I wasn't as impressed with
the ink. It's nice, but I'm don't love how my handwriting looks with this pen,
so I'm gifting it to my boyfriend who's eyes lit up when he saw I had ordered
it. The gel on the barrel feels so nice on my finger as I write. I would try
other Uni JetStream pens as I am overall impressed by the brand, just not this
particular pen. "
henrywvoro,"October 25, 2020",The rubber grip is nice and it writes good. 
ashley.3.e,"October 24, 2020","My new favorite pen for class notes, letters,  & creative writing! Dries
quickly, very visible, super smooth when writing on a Rhodia. Erases as close to
perfectly as a pen can. Not particularly fine, so I don't use it for planners or
forms, but perfect for all sorts of longhand writing."
Mellanie.audrey,"October 4, 2020",Love this pen! 
kian,"October 1, 2020","This is the pen I've been longing for. It's not perfect, but it definitely was enough to keep me very satisfied. The
only flaw I really see with this pen is the grip attracting dirt, only because
of the gel material used, but it doesn't bother me at all.I am more focused on the ergonomic feature, because I have the death grip! It definitely relieved some of the tension that builds in my hand over time and
the soft grip is something I really wanted to go for, which exceeded my
expectations. Ballpoint pens are my personal favorite types of pens, so the ink
flow was fairly smooth, no skips, and was intense enough for my liking. The body is made of this brushed metal and I love it. Weight is right for me."
magrestaphd,"September 8, 2020","Very comfortable and easy line. I bought this pen bc I felt the beginnings of
carpel tunnel and the grip seems to help by making pressure on the paper
unnecessary, by its light weight, and by keeping my grip loose."
cesar.alberto.vg,"August 19, 2020","This is by far the SMOOTHEST pen I've ever used, so comfy to hold. This is my

jess.dev,"August 10, 2020",Its like writing on air! So ergonomic and lovely.
allysonpenadeniz2005,"July 29, 2020","Amazing grip, but I don’t like the ink. I use another pen for the ink instead
and it works perfectly! "
narthan,"May 24, 2020","The pen itself writes nicely and has a good build quality. The gel grip is very
comfortable. The real kicker here is the brushed body. It feels very gritty in
the hand and is not enjoyable. hopefully with time it will smooth out and not be
as much of a nuisance."
ordonioa,"May 20, 2020","I purchased a couple and I tend to have a death grip. I feel more confident in
writing long periods of time. I'm personally a fine line writer so, I swapped
the .7 for a .28 and a .5 SXR. The .7 is very smooth but, .28 and .5 is a dream.
"
jasimhaw,"May 8, 2020","I've been using this pen for about a year now, and it's become one of my
favorites. The metal body feels very premium, and is a good weight for writing
without the need to press on the paper. And, obviously, the squishy grip is a
dream for long writing sessions. My only wish is that the gel went a little
farther down towards the tip of the pen. I've needed to adjust my grip slightly
higher than what's natural to me, but it hasn't been too much of an issue that I
don't use it. My main concern when buying it was that the gel would collect all
matter of lint and dust, but I haven't had any problems with it. A single cat
hair will occasionally grip to it, but I can just brush it off with my fingers -
no washing or wiping down necessary. "
ega63,"March 21, 2020",Extremely smooth and comfortable.  I need to write book with this pen.
birdybro,"March 9, 2020","Amazing deal for the money. I recommend this to everyone. The weight
distribution is perfect, the ergonomic grip is probably the 2nd best I've ever
used (Pilot Dr. Grip being #1), and it's just all around a pleasant writing
experience with this."
mr.vicly,"January 13, 2020",love this pen as my everyday pen. personally i use the pentel energel infree gel pen refill 0.7mm on this barrel.as i prefer bold inky lines.
haysb,"December 19, 2019","I write a lot--I wrote my book longhand--then this is a great pen.  The grip is
about as comfortable as you will find.  I'm not a huge fan of ballpoint but the
Jetstream is the best of them with a gel ink look and feel.  It comes with a
.7mm size but you can swap in a finer size or other refills.  (I have a .5
Pentel Needle Point Gel refill in mine now.)  My only complaint is that the grip
is a bit sticky and gathers dust/dirt so the pen is not one to carry around. 
But it is a great pen for your writing desk."
cakepizzaster,"November 17, 2019",Writes smoothly and grip provides extra comfort for me. 
Glenn,"October 24, 2019","Honestly my favorite pen.  Has a nice weight and writes extremely smooth.  The
grip makes writing for extended periods more relaxing as well.  "
diwadaily,"October 10, 2019","I bought this and two other Uni Jetstream ballpoint pens to test out after
having these in my JetPens wish list for so long. Each one wrote super smoothly
without skipping or ink fading, which I'm thankful for because these were
purchased last September 16th. I just tried writing a full page with the Alpha Gel ballpoint pen and my hand
didn't ache as much as it did when I'd use other pens in my stash. The gel grip
really helps me hold onto the pen and maintain the line as I write. I still
consider the MUJI ballpoint pen as one of my favorites, but the Uni Jetstream
Alpha Gel pen is definitely on that list now. "
rlbond86,"September 18, 2019","This is a really comfortable pen with a premium metal body! The alpha gel kind
of gives it a weird shape that makes it hard to fit in a pen loop though. I use
it when I need to write a large amount. "
Papi,"September 15, 2019","I don't usually get rollerball pens because I think them inferior to gel pens.
But this has quickly become my favorite pen that I own. It's super smooth,
slick, comfortable, and just overall great. My only issue is that after about 1
month it started skipping with the cartridge still ~60% full. "
wangniannian2001,"May 17, 2019","Extremely comfortable, and the Alpha-Gel grip is quite good. Good weight and
size. The black grip makes dust more obvious, however, so if that bothers you
the white grip versions may be better. "
tobi,"May 13, 2019",Comfortable to use and a pleasure to write with
eal1,"May 10, 2019","This is a great pen and even better with Pentel energel refills, which fit just
fine.  Nice solid metal body with pleasantly squishy grip.  The only downside is
that I keep losing them, am on my third, but that's because I carry it around
because it's such a nice pen."
Kitty,"January 27, 2019","The best ballpoint ever! I don't want to put it down because it is so squishy
and comfy. I replaced it with a .38 refill and it is my favourite pen now."
smjones0128,"January 24, 2019","The pen itself is nicely weighted and the grip is really nice and comfortable,
but after about a week of use, the ink will not write consistently and die out
randomly. I checked the ink cartridge and its still basically full but it is
almost as if there is air bubbles that prevents it from producing consistent
lines."
Tsum Tum,"December 24, 2018","The pen is quite nice with a metal barrel.  The grip is, as always superb, with
a grippy and comfortable feel.  The ink inside the pen writes very smoothly and
has a very dark pigment. I would recommend this colour more than all the other
ones because of its sharp, sleek look, and the grip will be much cleaner."
ADR in NY,"November 26, 2018","Good weight, the gel grip is comfortable, the brush metal gives it a sleek look,
and the hybrid ink is a great alternative to gel (darker than a ballpoint,
oil-based ink and smooth on paper). I agree with some reviews I've read that
said the gel grip being so far from the tip makes holding it somewhat
uncomfortable. It does feel like you're quite a distance from the tip. I believe
those that tend to grab closer to the tip may find this pen awkward to hold.
Still, a really great pen!"

Caesar Tjalbo,"October 7, 2015",2nd review.The pen is still fantastic but the ink runs out too fast imho. 1 star down.
lightning spaniel,"June 30, 2015","This was my first experience with a Jetstream pen.  I sprung for the Alpha Gel
grip because...well...it looked sexy.Jetstream pens are right in-between the thick oil ink of a ""traditional""
ballpoint pen and the solid/liquid hybrid ink of a gel pen.  So, I guess you
could say they're a hybrid...of the hybrids?Anyways, they are definitely a lot smoother than ye ol' ballpoint pens.  You
don't have to press hard at all to get consistent line quality.  I also picked
up the .38 size refill and swapped it out for the .7 and was surprised at how
well the .38 held up.  Not scratchy at all and the consistency was quite good
for such a finer tip.  I'm probably going to grab the .5 tip and give it a go.The squishy grip is my favorite part though.  It's not stupid squishy to where
it's distracting, but it's not as hard as a rubber grip.  I think it's just
right.  That, and the fact that the pen has a little weight to it, makes it a
really fun and comfortable pen to use.I'd recommend one, even if you don't spring for the fancy grip."

natashaingrid7,"June 4, 2015","Love this pen.  I had to hide it from everyone in my family, but eventually it

page smoothly with no skipping. I would recommend this pen to anyone who writes
a lot."
livetruesight,"February 3, 2015","I really love the grip on this thing. It's durable, and will last forever. The
ink is the only thing that gets me on 4 stars. It tends to break lines if not
completely perpendicular to the table, but then again, it probably might just be
the refill. I'm sure other inks would do this pen really good! "

firstpackage,"August 31, 2011","OH MY GOD. I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY FOR BUYING A PEN OVER 2 DOLLARS. IM NOT. THE
ALPHA GEL IS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY. WRITING IS SO INCREDIBLY SMOOTH. It
almost feels like it glides on the paper. Sometimes I look forward to doing my
assignments because of this pen. :)"
michakaufman,"April 22, 2011","This pen is absolutely awesome. The carbon area looks and feels great and the
gel is a nice gimmick. One this tho, the gel area is located a little high in my
opinion, so the grip is only perfect for those holding the pen at a higher
point."
stratoduck,"April 3, 2011","One thing about this pen, and Signo 207 gel that isn't mentioned is the balance.
My penmanship is better because of it. It also enables me to write exceptionally
small. Really an terrific pen for people writing all day on carbon forms which
require a ballpoint."
cuninjadriver,"March 29, 2011","Nice weight and feel to this pen. The cushioned end makes it easy to write for
long periods of time. This pen is worth every penny."
stella,"March 23, 2011","I bought 2 uni-jetstream pens,one is pink ( not from jetpens) ,the other is
black( from jetpens).I'm so obsessed with these good handwriting with good apparence pens . Among all
the pens I've used, this pen is the best pen!The pen is of high quality, the ink is bright and smooth. The rubbery grab part
is very comfortable .Using this pen, writing became an enjoy thing. You can never miss this perfect
pen if you are a person who addicts to pens just like me."
PenaciousH,"March 1, 2011","Always love the ink (prefer the 1.0). Like this one because grip is squishy but
less so than the gel premier. Overall though I like (though am bored with, design/color wise) the Premier
Jetstream (available in mainstream stores)...Maybe JetPens can get the JS
Premier in other colors? Very good pen!"
pilar.at.work,"February 11, 2011","This pen is fantastic! The weight is very nice for higher-gripping writers, the
gel is mega comfortable, and it is very solid feeling with a nice, strong action
in it's mechanics. The fact that Jetstream refills fit is a great asset as these
refills are nice and smooth. If you have the extra cash, I would say this is an
excellent pen for everyday writing. The only downside is that the gel attracts fuzz, so don't be surprised if it
feels 'gross' out of your pocket. Other than that, I love this pen."
lpmusicmanlp,"July 28, 2010","Nice construction. Should note though, it works better if you like writing with
your hand higher up the pen (given the positioning of the grip). It is quite
heavy, but most of this is concentrated at the bottom due to the grip, so it's
actually not very noticeable when you're writing. Considerably thick due to the
grip obviously, so if you like slim pens, you might want to think about that
(squeezing the grip can sorta make it feel like it's not as thick as it is,
though). In any case, I don't find the dimensions of the pen to bother me at
all. Ink is nice, of course.  I doubt you will be disappointed with the quality of the pen as a whole, just be
careful that it suits your writing preferences. That being said, it's nothing
you can't get used to. I bought a large range of pens recently and this is my
favorite ballpoint, so I recommend it."
choyan,"January 2, 2010","Love the feel of the aluminum and the alpha gel! The smoothness of the jetstseam
goes without saying. Worth every penny!"
maryjuliajett,"December 28, 2009","I like this pen a lot. Comfortable, metal and sturdy, weighted but not super
heavy. I took a refill from one of the less professional looking or sturdy 0.5
pens and it writes fantastic. My only complain is that the grip seems to collect
lint and other things. a little water cleans it, but it picks it up quite fast.
otherwise it's a good pen, though i am not sure and a good casing for the
fantastic uniball jetstream refills."
thorisoka42,"October 21, 2009",I love them! Please you have to restock :(
xieniii,"May 12, 2009","This isn't the exact model that I have, but Sanford/Uni-ball's Jetstream series
pens are THE BEST pens I have ever written with. EVER. Smooth ink that doesn't
smudge or soak into the fibers of the paper. The ink almost seems to hug the
paper. I dunno how to describe it, but it's great. Once, when a professor
borrowed my Jetstream pen and forgot to return it, I went to great lengths to
get it back. It's that good."
musiconly.louis,"April 19, 2009","This is so good, if i could, ill buy 100 of them!"
mindybatt54,"November 9, 2008","My favorite ballpoint pen ever. Love the Alpha Gel Grip and the jetstream ink is
like a cross between ballpoint and gel ink - darker than normal ballpoint ink
but doesn't have the finish like gel. Well worth the $15"

lucida,"February 27, 2017","This is my 2nd Alpha Gel Grip that has stopped writing.. I don't know what is
wrong with the pen refill.. I'm using the one that came in the pen.
Disappointed.. "
vnhknguyen,"January 16, 2014","I did a lot of research and I was a bit disappointed when I used the pen. I am
too a pen addict and I am very picky in terms of which pen I use. Overall, it's
a great ballpoint pen. I thought the ink would be more like pentel v5, which is
still my favorite pen as it is ridiculously affordable yet its quality is
superb. I read someone's review that you can also refill this pen with 0.38 mm
and have no problem with the pen tip being scratchy. So I ordered this pen and
15 0.38 mm refills. Now that I replaced the 0.7 mm with 0.38 mm, it isn't all
that great. "
2dogs5catscrew,"July 8, 2012","I'd like to try this pen. The grips look really comfortable which is very
important to me. I am also interested in the Jetstream function. This pen looks
really great!"
caraannedublin,"January 8, 2020","Such beautiful inks! As I said in my review of the other Sarasa vintage color
set, I'm typically a fountain pen girl, but when I want a more versatile daily
pen, these are my go-to. I use them in my day planner to color-code certain
events - the cassis red is the loveliest raspberry color, and the camel yellow
is the only yellow pen I have ever seen which writes dark enough to show up
clearly and legibly on all paper. Smooth writing, quick-drying, non-transfer.
Highly recommended!"
quivalasaynow,"September 26, 2019","All Zebra pens are always wonderful writing tools. I love lots of pens so that I
have a variety of colors. These Vintage color pens have colors you don't see
often. I have only seen these by Zebra. I call them my ""harvest colors"" because
I love fall and like to write with these colors during this time of year, The
price is Great and you will be getting pens with a large supply of ink. Delivery
was very quick, also. "
mycupofteax23,"October 14, 2019","I absolutely love this set! The colors are gorgeous and I love the point size!
They're super smooth and dry quickly! "
harmbruster,"October 12, 2019",Love these!  They write so smooth!  
mpalapostolos,"September 23, 2019",Beautiful fall colors and Sarasa smooth good quality ink. So pretty.
Joe C,"August 31, 2021","Officially my favorite pens. Smooth, comfortable, and each one is absolutely
gorgeous. The ink actually has some character to it as it dries, which isn’t
always the case with gel pens. "
luha700,"September 24, 2020","i already loved the sarasa clips, but the antique color selection is even
better! i love how they changed the design, too, with the cream and gold clip.
they write as smoothly as you expect from any other sarasa! "
pinkkinsanity,"August 4, 2020","These vintage colours are so pretty. I have the other set as well and these
colours complement each other beautifully. The yellow is like a deep marigold
which is still visible and does not feel like you're straining your eyes. The
colours are just different enough from the basic colours yet not wildly neon. I
love these!"
Pseudonym,"June 14, 2022","I've had a Zebra Sarasa Clip pen (specifically 0.5 in black) in all my pen cases
since I started elementary school. I've tried what seems to be a million pens
throughout the years, and this is one of the few pens that I can't replace. I
love the Sarasa line, and this beautifully colored set is no exception.Before I critique these pens, I would like to mention two things. Firstly, I've
repurchased refills for my vintage Sarasa pens several times over many years,
but I only decided to write this review now. Secondly, I have used these pens on
a variety of papers. From thick to thin, from smooth to textured, colored, and
every kind of ruled paper. I'm basing this review on my overall experience with
what I noticed from using them on a variety of writing surfaces, but every pen
will work best with the surface it was made for. These pens have extremely smooth ink. It dries quickly and has no bleed-through
(almost no shadowing on thin paper). I have used many highlighters with these
pens, and I haven't noticed any smudging after letting the ink dry for a few
seconds. Promptly as I finish the sentence, they are dry enough to highlight. I
have never gotten any transferring or fading of the ink. The ink flows easily,
with no skipping. The amount of ink in these pens is incredible, especially for
the price. I write a lot, and I only need refills on the colors I use the most
once a year. The colors are gorgeous, easy on the eyes, and fairly unique.I have very few negatives with these pens. I love the design of the barrels, the
creme-colored clip with the muted colors, and the gold accents. But the grip
isn't the best. It's comfortable, though if you have a strong grip or write for
long periods of time: I would recommend purchasing more comfortable grips to put
on the pens or getting the refills and putting them in your favorite pen
barrels. I use the 0.5 tips, but I have purchased the 0.4 in the past and found
them slightly scratchy. Overall, these are some of my favorite pens. I love these colors for
note-taking, journaling, and everything in between. If you like the Sarasa line
and love these colors, I recommend purchasing them. If you have never used a
Zebra Sarasa pen before... beware: you might end up with every color they carry."
Tyler,"November 6, 2020","Beautiful colors! Writes very smooth and gives a unique color to your pen set.
Zebra sarasa pens always deliver and I would recommend these to anyone. The 0.5
tip is also very versatile and the pens don’t take forever to dry. "
En Passant,"December 17, 2019","Finally, I have it!!! Very happy, great interesting colors. Good writing as
always with Sarasa.Thank you JetPens!!!"
Mamaumbra,"October 20, 2019","Loved the sarasas that came in my pen sampler pack that I went ahead and
purchased the 2 vintage sets.  Smooth to write with and colors are unique!"
thaumbody,"October 9, 2019","I love these colors. They are beautiful and I hope very durable (too soon to
tell on fading). Being Zebra Sarasa they dry very quickly and flow nicely on
cheap lined paper and copier paper. I'd love to see a vintage-style teal, orange
and magenta, but I'm quite content with the these. I'm putting them on my
reorder list, so I can have more ready when these eventually run dry."

Thespianlifestyle,"December 19, 2022","I've never used these colors before, but I'm familiar with the Sarasa line of
Zebra gel pens. And I was just as impressed with these elegant, vintage hues. I
feel very fancy writing with them. Sketching with them is better though as a
couple of the colors (notably the grey and red) skip at times. But still a solid
choice in my book!"
contact.shevcs,"November 25, 2022","Im not usually a fan of muted or vintage colors but I think this set has
completely turned me around on that. These pens are a real joy to write with"
TrekMomK,"November 23, 2022",What's not to love. Beautiful colors and writers and the price is right.
aerwin23,"November 19, 2022","Zebra Sarasa is one of the few brands I trust in the stationery world. And, once
again, I've placed my trust in the right set of autumnal pens. This vintage
collection has lovely jewel-type tones that write fluidly and add a pop of
warmth to a page. I'm very thankful this shop had this fantastic set in stock!  "
aprjoy,"October 23, 2022","Sarasas are my go-to gel pens. I particularly like these colors, because they're
unusual but subtle enough for work planning. Great for color coding!"
emilybeeating,"October 23, 2022","Love this line of pens, and these colors are good to mix and match for everyday
use. They do take a bit longer to dry than the 0.4mm and 0.3mm varieties."
caithenry56,"October 11, 2022","These are my favorite non-fountain pens. The colors are easy on the eyes, the
ink flows well without skipping, they also work well on poor quality paper. And
for the aesthetics, I appreciate the monochromatic bodies more than having a
utilitarian clear plastic to show how much ink I have used. Pretty sure JetPens
also sells individual pen refills, so this set is a no-brainer for anyone
starting school or a new job that requires a lot of writing that needs to be
distinguished by task. Plus, this set has the more traditional ink colors like
black and red while having some fun pops like the camel and purple. "

cataraw,"July 5, 2022","I love these pens! This is my first time using this brand and these colors. I
usually like a thicker tip, but these write nicely and a they are juicy. They
don’t seem to smear at all when writing. My only complaint is that the
purple-ish pen has stopped writing smoothly and skips when writing. There is
still plenty of ink left and I haven’t had the pens for very long. The others
seem to be writing fine though. "

the packaging to organize the pens in my pen case. They also write pretty
smoothly. Definitely recommend. "
Bran Howe,"June 19, 2022","All the colours in this set are gorgeous and luscious. I was especially
delighted with the camel yellow. It does lean a little bit more towards orange

vibrancy of the colour. I'm in love."

Anonymous,"December 8, 2021","I've commented on the first set of the Vintage set, and I don't really have too
much more to say about these pens, except that if you're on the fence about
them, please try them. My favorites from this set is the Bordeaux Purple and the
Camel Yellow. The Camel Yellow shows up beautifully on the Tomoe River Paper,
and it's a nice color that can easily be seen on white. I will get these pens
again, and I highly recommend getting the first Vintage set as well, since it
has even more colors!I'll post the cliffnotes of my first review here, since a lot of the same
comments I have for the first set apply to the second set.Pros: These pens' Ink flow can easily catch quick strokes and slower strokes. It
writes consistently, and makes it easy to write and continue writing. The Ink
Storage for these pens is tremendous. After 6 months of use, I'm still on my
first pack of pens. I'm in awe of how much ink there is in this. There's a lot
of fun color choices here. If you're someone who likes understated pen colors
over the glow of neon, you may like these pens. Reading written works with these
pens is easy on the eyes - it's not neon bright, but it's good for when I don't
want my writing to stand out as much, but still have some color to them.Cons: These pens are gel pens and do require a little bit of time to dry. They
dry pretty quickly, but they're not instant. Let them dry for a few seconds,
otherwise you will get smudging and ink dots. In addition, these pens aren't
well labeled. It's less a problem with this set due to the variety of colors,
but certain pen barrel colors tend to look similar in a dark environment. I'm
glad that I have some different pen barrels for the Sarasa (I bought them years
ago), but without a label to tell the colors apart, it can be pretty hard to
tell."

Rena V,"November 11, 2021","These pens are surprisingly fabulous. They write smoothly and evenly, which I
love about Sarasa pens. I was intrigued by the ink colors, but wondered if they
would be as uniquely compelling as I hoped. They are! I thought the camel yellow
would be my least favorite, but it has turned out to be the color I reach for
the most. Simply wonderful!"
jaze,"November 8, 2021","I bought both sets of the vintage colors because I have never tried to Sarasa
pen line and was really wanting some new, darker 0.5 ink colors. The colors are
nice but I personally don't particularly enjoy the writing experience as much as
I do with my tried and true Pentel energel, I find the tip to be more scratchy
and the ink less fluid and smooth, even though it is a conical tip. I still use
them and probably will end up repurchasing, at least until I find darker shades
in the energel line up, but I do wish the ink was smoother. (Additionally, I
really really enjoy the bodies of these pens and do prefer them to the energel
pen body!)"

The ink lays down very smoothly and dries pretty fast.  Highly recommend."
justadabwilldo,"March 27, 2021","I bought these cause I really liked the vintage colors. You didn’t see too
many colors like these until Zebra Sarasa came out with them. They write smooth
and the colors match the pen. They do feel a little light in your hand because
the casing is  plastic. The clip works well, and it keeps your pen where u want
it. "

Francesca,"February 6, 2021","I bought this set after buying a few open stock pens of sets 1 and 2 to see if I
would like the colours, which I did. I wanted to buy some of the same ones I
previously bought and found that getting the set was the better deal. As with
the Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel pens of the regular lineup, this Vintage Color 2 set
this not disappoint me. My favourite are Camel Yellow, which looks like a dark
mustard, Sepia Black, which is a very dark brown, and Bordeaux Purple, my top
one of this lot. The dark grey reminds of graphite pencils and the Cassis Black
is a bit too red for me. All write smoothly, and I’ve experienced no skipping
or scratchiness, even on textured paper. I like them all, really, so much so
that I already bought the refills for each pen in this set."

to grip."

koinijikoimizu,"January 4, 2012","Honestly this is a really, really fabulous pen for whiting out areas in need of
correction. I've tested at least three other gel pens against it and in order of
similarity, some either held up well or just did not match the opacity and flow
of this pen. http://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Gelly-Roll-Regular-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.4-mm-White/pd
/531  Held up marvelously in terms of opacity and flow and to be so cheap I was
really surprised by how well it worked in compare to the Uni-ball.  The Uni-ball
is fantastic if you have to spot correct a semi largish area but the broadness
of the pen tip makes it harder if you do very fine spots so the 0.4mm of the
Sakura is a good twin to the 0.8mm of the Uni-ball. http://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Gel-Grip-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.8-mm-White/pd/50 0
this one was just not as great as I had imagined it would be. For the cost which
is close to the Uni-ball Signo Broad, I really did expect for this pen to be
just as opaque but the ink was actually rather thin over the pens and I tested
this against a variety of inks. It just did not do as well as the Uni-ball and
Sakura. http://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Sunburst-Metallic-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.7-mm-Silver/pd
/1309 Using the silver as a kind of aid for anyone considering on buying the
Pentel Sunburst Gel Ink Pen in White should JetPens ever bring it in stock. 
Still medium tip and much like the Hybrid, it was just not as thick as it could
have been.  Repeated layering doesn't seem to be a huge problem but I like being
able to put down a coat of white from the onset. In summation, if you draw, stick with the Sakura or the Uni-ball.  Pentel is a
great pen company but they just need to thick up their white or make it more
opaque."
LizardbethArt,"February 27, 2011","For some reason white is a hard color for most gel pens to get right, but
Uniball is the best I've tried (and I've tried a LOT). It's smooth and bold, and
doesn't have have the ""I'm acting like I'm dry even though it's clear I'm full
of ink"" issue a lot of gel pens seem to have. If you're looking for an excellent
white pen, this is it!!"
crescentcreations,"August 28, 2011","I'm kind of disappointed with these because I can't use them for what I really
wanted them for, and I bought 2 :\ The white that comes out is a thick white, but the width of the line that the
pen makes is too thick for the kind of detailing I wanted to do.Also, there is a peak/ball wherever you lift up the pen. For the most part it
settles down. It's not a huge deal, especially if you're just using them for
writing, but you see the little dot at the end of a line... I'm a little picky
because I'm using them for artwork.  It just depends how picky you are if this would matter to you or not ^_^; If I had bought these in a retail store, I probably would end up returning at
least one of them to get something else, since I think it will take awhile to
use up just one for what else I can find to use them for on artwork.I wanted them for a fast and more convenient way of making line details, but
they can at least be used for a quicker way of doing dot detailing ( quicker
than my dip pen and white ink ) So, that is just my opinion based on what I was looking to use them for.It's not a very expensive item, so if you're looking for a nice thick white ink,
I'd recommend trying one ( but only if you're already buying over $25.00 worth
of items to get the free shipping :) "

Erin,"November 14, 2016","I use white pens to write on dark surfaces, cards, and letters as I bought some
dark stationary a while back that I like very much.  However my search for a
white pen, that doesn't write like a correction pen or white out has been
futile, until now.  This pen works!  The ink shows up extremely well on dark
paper, cards and other surfaces, such as writing on photo's for notes or
scrapbooking.  Excellent pen, ink, thickness, etc. I can't say enough good
things about this pen.  It would be an understatement to say that I have spent
over a hundred dollars to find a white ink pen that just worked.  From Jelly
Roll's to correction ink pens, white paint markers, I've tried them all.  THIS
IS THE REAL DEAL!"
LilMissFangirl,"February 15, 2013","I draw manga and occasionally color them, so a good white gel pen is handy to
have. This, is not. For small shines in the eyes it's alright, the flow of the
ink is generally okay, but it seems very runny. I have to use multiple coats to
get it pure white over dry marker ink and God forbid I try to use it to make a
minor touch up. It takes forever to dry, which is problematic seeing as you need
at least two coats for opaque white ink. Overall, I wouldn't pay $2.50 +
Shipping to get this again. Not worth the effort to use."
well they work,"October 9, 2018","I got this pen bc the reviews here were all positive. Maybe I was just unlucky
and got a bad one. :( From the first day i tried using this pen, it didn't work.
It made double lines (two white lines and blank in the middle), the flow was
uneven and the pen squeaked. I tried repeatedly over time, even tried to make
the ink holding section warm up but no avail. It was such a disappointing
experience, that i forgot about this pen at all until just now because i'm
looking for a new one. "

rithomas33,"January 30, 2012","Writes on glass if you get it started on paper first. I got this pen for writing
on dark objects, such as raised lettering black on black plastic. On water based
fountain pen ink the bleed through is about 50%. On Pilot G2 gel ink about 33%,
but I was not looking for a correction pen, so that's OK with me."
betolung,"July 17, 2016","All sketching kits should have a white ink gel pen for making corrections and
adding highlights to ink drawings. The Uni-ball Signo Broad UM-153 white ink gel
pen is a good choice for these tasks. My old one already got used up, and it was
well past time I replaced it in my primary sketching kit. The white ink is
smooth, opaque, and easy flowing."
Robbyn,"July 3, 2016","I purchased this pen to address kraft paper wedding envelopes for my friend's
wedding.  I also bought the Sakura Jelly Roll (it wrote too lightly).  This is
THE pen for writing on dark-colored or kraft envelopes.  I'm ordering more for
another round of wedding envelopes.  The writing is smooth, the right amount of
ink is dispensed, and the ink holds up well on the envelopes."
zovinar,"September 23, 2021","THE choice for art and crafting when you need the most opaque ink out there! the
line is so this and juicy, it's a joy to use…most of the time. the ink is a
bit *too* thick and soft at times and will railroad (split) when you write out
actual sentences with it. for most things I'd rec this pen, but for writing letters/lettering on dark
paper I'd go for the Pentel Hybrid Gel Grip Gel Pen - 0.8 mm - White. It's not
as opaque but it doesn't railroad and has a nice, natural, matte look to it.(this pen is still the one in my case though! for art it can't be beat)"
embers,"October 18, 2019","I really wanted to like this one, it's very pretty and I heard great things so
maybe I got a dud but I hate this pen.it clogs constantly, the ink seems to dry AS I'm writing with it and gets all
gummy. it always leaves a streak in the middle of the line bc of this, the
ballpoint scraping the paper and only the outline of the line actually laying
down any white, so I don't get a nice opaque line. Gonna try it in the finer
points and hopefully it goes better."
Tangle List,"December 19, 2018","This is a warning to anyone purchasing this pen with the intention of adding
highlights to their artwork. The Uni-Ball Signo white ink does NOT work well
when drawing over wax-based colored pencil such as Prismacolors. When drawing
over wax-based colored pencil, the ink comes out uneven and globs up. The end
result is that the highlights don’t look as bold and clean as expected.  Use a
white paint pen for your highlights instead, or apply white paint with a fine
brush. I learned this lesson the hard way.I’ll still give this pen 4 stars because it produces a beautiful bold white
line when used directly on paper. The white ink looks amazing when drawing or
writing directly on black paper. For other uses, though, a white paint pen might
be better suited for your needs. Do your research—ink vs. paint—before
buying.        "

Mailee,"August 4, 2018","Very nice quality, but after using it a couple times, the ink got kind of
scratchy and streaky.   If you're trying to get a nice clean white line, you
have to write quite slowly.  The ink is pretty good, but wouldn't use as white out especially if you're using
black pen,  even in the black ink dries and you write over top of it, it blends
with the ink, or looks transparent.  Definitely not made to be a white out pen,
but pretty good for small additional highlights or details in drawings and such."

steve,"April 4, 2012","If not THE absolute best, certainly one of the very best in my book! I have
tried many of the white gel pens in a search for the best one that I like the
most.  This one is superbly brighter white... with practically zero
transparency.  Uni-ball has certainly gotten this one right... a sure winner! 
The pen glides effortlessly and very smoothly across the page as if it was on
glass.  Leaves a nice wet and definitely broad/bold line. Drys quickly. If I
absolutely had to choose some sort of negative about this pen, it would be that
they don't last quite as long as I would prefer. They tend to run out of gel a
little earlier than your normal, everyday gel pen.  I am guessing, but it is
probably due to the gel itself being a little thicker in order to exhibit the
smoothness & and boldness it has... well worth the trade-off. I am simply enamored with this model pen!  In fact I was so thrilled with the
performance of this white version, I ordered several of each of the other colors
of the UM-153 and now use them for everything! The gold and silver are
incredible on a black background also!  I even use them at work now, also.  I
use the Blue/Black one as my favorite signature pen.  At just $2.50 a piece, one
can afford to pick up a stockpile of them.  Thanks Uni-ball and JetPens!"
picoangelal,"February 22, 2012","Great for adding highlights and details to your drawings! The white ink is
pretty opaque and even comes out on top of black surfaces or ink. It's not
really meant for filling large spaces since the ink doesnt always smooth out and
look uniform. The best use for this pen is to add small details to your finished
drawings to make them pop."

leaf,"October 17, 2022","Bordering on goopy, this is the opaque, white ink-on-the-go that dreams are made
of."
maggiefeng_94,"September 26, 2022","One of the best if not the best white gel pens out there to write over dark
colors - it shows up perfectly on top of dark paper and/or dark lettering to add
your touch of highlight or detail. Perfect for all of those things and note
taking on dark paper. "
Henry,"September 19, 2022","Best white pen. It's really hard to find a good white pen for minor fine
corrections, or for use in art. This doesn't have the issues that other white
pens have. The ink isn't too thin. The ink comes out consistently, and doesn't
act like it is clogged, or skip spots. The only other white pens I've tried that work as well are all way thicker
lines. I would compare it to the Sailor Mini Correction Pen (1.0mm), but with a
thinner line. Both have excellent coverage, though the ink can be visibly thick
(when you leave a dot of ink and it dries, it does not lay completely flat, and
can be scraped off on accident if it is freshly dry). You might have to add additional layers over very black ink to get a bright
white, which is why the thickness of the dried ink may matter. It isn't perfect, but considering how hard it is to find a white-ink pen that
works consistently, I'd say it's close enough."
magerhans,"September 16, 2022",Excellent product to write bank checks & prevent theft.
yihaa,"September 6, 2022",Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Very opaque 
kataholik,"September 4, 2022","This is my go to white pen when making marks on my journal pages. It rarely if
ever skips and is a nice, bright white. "
mimharpist,"September 1, 2022","Writes beautifully on black paper.  Dries quickly enough to be suitable for a
lefty.  But, for $3.00, this pen runs out of ink very quickly.  I can only write
a couple of letters with it before it runs out.  I can't justify the cost for
myself.  This pen is perfect for accenting your drawing or correspondence, but
not for large projects, nor for writing long missives.  "
withadventure,"August 29, 2022","This is hands down the best white pen I have ever used. It's opaque, the line is
thick enough to see, and I never had to worry about it skipping or not wanting
to write. "
amberweeks1210,"August 25, 2022",I prefer this over the gelly roll white pen.
Cammy,"August 11, 2022","This pen just isn't for me. I bought the pen so I can to write on colored/dark
printout and while it does it, It's not without some struggle. For the pen to
work best, you need to write in an almost upright position, and slowly but not
too slow. It's great if you want to put little decorations stuff. "
thessalyrose,"August 10, 2022","This is my new favorite white ink pen. The stroke is wide and opaque and feels
like a gel pen should feel when you use it. I will be trying this in all the
other colors too. "
jasonrkr,"August 3, 2022","Very nice white ink pen.  Lays down a nice line of white ink and isn't too broad
for smaller lettering.  Would definitely buy again."
edwardsbill1,"July 26, 2022",Works great. Impressive opaque white ink coverage.
KatePDX,"July 23, 2022","Best White pens!!!  I buy several at a time as I use them in artwork and for fun

Ceme,"June 9, 2022","Can I give this a 10! If you want to correct mistakes while journaling, grab
this pen. If it came in a .5, it would be perfect for writing, but the 1.0 makes
the line thicker. I’m loving it for my pantry jar labeling too. Thanks
JetPens! "
Brian,"June 6, 2022","Seriously the ""ne plus ultra"" of white opaque ink pens. The gel ink is nice and
thick and is more opaque than every other white gel pen available. And even some
paints! Beware though: Even after 5-10 minutes of dry time I've had some alcohol
inks bleed into the white gel ink and discolor it. So swatch test before final
art! :)"
Kaede,"June 4, 2022","I found this pen recently and discovered it still works: I don't recall how long
ago I got it. For illustration purposes, however, it's less opaque than a white
Posca. I'm also having issues, on some paper, with a dark line down the center
of the white line it draws, when drawing on dark paper or an area which has
first been colored with alcohol markers."

like a fine tip white out pen. Exactly what I wanted."
rmagana144,"April 18, 2022","Love the white ink on dark paper, but it doesn't really roll well on top of
airbrush paint. Also, if you go over your line more than once, it scrapes off
some of the previously laid out ink. I think I would only use it for writing
notes on dark paper."
mjp854,"April 11, 2022","Great for highlighting on top of my Karin Brushmarkers. Jet Pens delivery is so

nikkeyseeairuh,"March 31, 2022","Great for small white accents on art work. Takes a few seconds for the ink to
dry after applied, but looks beautiful and the pen writes smoothly."
onigirigirl56,"March 25, 2022","This pen is my best tool when I draw eyes of people or animals or anything that
needs a superfine highlight in white. After you draw the white on top of your
painted area to highlight or correct, I take a sharpened colored pencil, if it
needs to match the background, or be a highlight slightly lighter than the base
color. I can use it for defining snow on trees, as well. Love these pens, and
the only place that sells them near me is always out. That alone should tell you
something about the quality. Be sure to let it dry, before you do anything else,
and usually it has to be the finishing touch on the work. "

hnredmon,"February 28, 2022","This is the most opaque white ink pen I have tried. It writes smoothly, but you

white paper. Love it. "
billynickey,"February 15, 2022","The absolute best white ink pen but you can watch the ink go down as you draw.
Also, you need to give the point a wipe after pauses to get the little scab of
clotted ink off. I just have reached a point in my life where every empty pen in the trash can
feels wasteful, like conspicuous consumption. I'll stick with Higgins Super
White in a brush or on a nib. "
Sarah S,"February 11, 2022","After being disappointed in my white Gelly Roll I gave this a try. I’m SO glad
I did. It writes a thick white line and is great for addressing dark envelopes

cat.lobre,"December 5, 2021","I purchased the Uni-ball Signo Broad UM-153 Gel Pen - White Ink to cover lines
in my planner and write on dark paper. It works very well. It does have a
tendency for the ink to bead on smoother surfaces (like on mt Solids Washi Tape
- Matte Black - 15 mm x 10 mby mt), but I just go over the letters a few times and by adding more ink it
helps to reduce the ink from beading. The ink does take a bit of time to dry,
but it's worth it. This is the best white ink pen I've tried so far, and I plan
to purchase more in the future. "

super smooth. I definitely prefer this to the white Sakura Gelly Roll. It does

amazing on black or dark colored paper :)"

Rotsterne,"September 6, 2021","I bought this pen, hoping I could use it to correct tiny mistakes that brush-on

fairly well for that. Some inks will bleed through a little bit, but that
doesn't bother me much, as I'm mostly aiming for improved readability, not
absolute perfection."

and they stopped working even though I can see ink in the barrel."
len293,"June 30, 2021","I've loved every other Uni-Ball Signo gel pen I've used, but this one was just
okay. The ink itself is great-- opaque and a good consistency, like the other
Signo colors. I use it to highlight/accent watercolor paintings. But the
rollerball is so finicky and gets clogged with ink. It doesn't ruin my art, but
it's annoying to repeatedly unclog the tip and redraw lines. Tips: store with
the cap side down, keep scrap paper nearby for scribbling if the ink stops
flowing, wipe dried ink off the tip if necessary, and try slightly changing the
angle of the pen while drawing."

CleverCanine,"November 22, 2020","This is my first time using a white gel pen, and I'm still trying to figure out
what it does best with.  When I used it over a block of thoroughly dry black
Lamy ink, it leached the color up and turned grey.  Going over it multiple times
just made it gummy.  When I used it over dry Noodler's Baystate Blue, it stayed
white and vibrant. It writes very smoothly--despite it being called a gel pen, I
was expecting more of a paint pen experience, so was pleasantly surprised. It
can be a little scratchy if you don't hold it just right, particularly when
doubling up on your strokes.  Give it a try.  It's a versatile little pen and
fun to have in the collection."

The Uni-ball Signo's white gel ink would smear with the ink I was trying to
cover up. Then, after a while of using the pen (more than a year, I think) when
trying to get the ink flowing, the ball either pushed in or came out. (I did
store the pen horizontally)"

is useless. I’ve tried many hacks to get it started. Nothing worked for me.

Not impressed,"August 19, 2020","I was hoping for a lot better results than I'm seeing.  I gonna try some of the
other white gel pens out there to see if I experience the same thing.  These
just seem to require a ton of ""shaking"" and discarding when there's obviously
plenty of ink left in the cartridge....  I'm writing on conventional copy type
paper, the only difference is it's black paper, not the regular ""white copy
paper"".  It should be clogging the tip like a coated paper might do, but I'm
just not having much success on anything."

rebekahrjryan,"June 15, 2020","It's a good pen if you are going to use it to write on dark paper. I bought it
to use as ""white-out"". Many of the reviews said it worked for them so I thought
I would try it. For me, the ink didn't have enough coverage over black or white
ink. If it were marketed as a ""White-out"" pen I would give it one star... but as
a white writing pen it's a solid 4. Takes a long time to dry but it's smooth
enough. "

justnick,"May 16, 2020","These are a top seller for a reason. They work so well. Yes, it might blob a

Myrima,"April 7, 2020","This is Empress Dowager of all white pens! I keep several around for fear of

flatw00ds,"January 10, 2020","Excellent correcting pen for illustration. I prefer this pen over comparable
ones, such as the jelly rolls, because the generous ink flow and broader ball
point don't pick up tacky inks as readily and turn the whiteout to gray. Depending on your preferred paper and ink setup, you might not need that
feature; very absorbent papers or thin, quick drying inks seem to do just fine
with my jelly rolls. But I really prefer to ink with a pentel pocket brush on
bristol board. I'm frugal and flip the paper over when I make a mistake, drawing
on the 'wrong' side that's a bit shinier and makes the ink dry take longer. If
you like papers with a slight finish like that, I'd say you owe yourself this
pen. It can correct a line within a minute of drying as opposed to a half hour
on this type of paper.My only negative is that jetpens doesn't sell refills for these! Jetpens, please
stock white refills; I hate the idea of even more plastic going in a landfill. I
cannot recommend these pens without reservations because of that one aspect."

very smooth and white, as it should be, but if you're looking for a more
fine-tipped pen, this wouldn't be it, since it has such a wide tip."

Nico Robin,"October 30, 2019","I like it! Super effective! Two issues I noticed: One, it's not very easy to rewrite over the white jell, as
it rises from the page. So only for after finished corrections or for outlining

older drawing."

Anonymous,"August 24, 2019","This gel pen is okay. My go-to white gel pen has always been (and still is) the
Sakura Gellyroll. I tried the Uni-ball Signo due to its popularity among the art
community. It's OKAY. The ink is a bright white and flows nicely, I admit, but I
find that it doesn't stay that way long term. On top of Copics or watercolors, I
find the ink picks up the color underneath it and loses its brightness quickly.
Although the Sakura Gellyroll isn't as bright of a white at first, it at least
retains its color better over time and doesn't stain or discolor as quickly
compared to the Uni-ball Signo. I also used this in a black paper notebook and
the white ink rubbed and transferred to the adjacent page upon closing and
reopening the notebook. This was not another problem with other gel pens, just
the Uni-ball Signo. Yeah... not my favorite unfortunately. I will continue to
stick with the Sakura Gellyroll instead."
speadskates,"August 9, 2019","Best white pen, great ink flow."

having it now I’ve got to say it’s one of the best gel pens I own. Maybe
even my staple art supply from now on. The white pigment is so rich and it flows
so smoothly on paper, I’ve never had a better white gel pen for detail. It can
make large dots and even small touch ups, it’s absolutely amazing and I adore
this pen"

charleah,"May 25, 2019","Makes a good-sized white line that I use for details on my drawings and for an
outline on words in my bullet journal! Takes a bit to dry in the areas where the
ink builds up, but that's expected. Makes a pretty solid white line, but for
darker colors that it lies on top of, you'll need to go over the area again for
a clearer white line! Overall, I love using it!"
DNICE,"May 23, 2019","Okay for using over acrylic painting, but when used to draw fine white lines
over watercolor, the line is ""raised"" because there is a thickness to the ink,
similar to white-out."

Roman,"January 10, 2019","Almost a correction pen. The ink in this pen is very opaque, enough to cover the
black pigment ink, but it is also very thick resulting in an elevated layer of
white when dries up. Unfortunately this layer is not very durable and can be
scraped easily leaving not-so-opaque marks. Also it has a little bit of a pear
sheen in it."

Pedro AKA vhbaske,"August 30, 2018","These pens are useful for artists or people who have to correct fountain pen
mistakes. Also, for giving white touches for drawings and art in general. The
ink is very heavy, strong and durable. It also dries very fast. Good also for
left handed people like me, who need a very fast drying ink. I like them very
much, so I ordered three of them in my last purchase. I have many uses for these
pens in white, soon I will try other colors, because the many things that you
can do with these pens is almost unlimited. Of course, for the purpose that they
were manufactured for."

baby bonsai,"August 18, 2018"," So I saw the reviews for this pen clocking in at a 4.7 star review, and upon
checking the reviews I expected a good decent pen for the price. I gotta say,
I'm pretty underwhelmed.  When I bought the pen, I was very excited to see if the pen was as good as
people said it was. I have another name brand white pen that just didn't look
good at all, it was extremely milky (besides the point). So I was expecting this
one to be a step up. While it's not really a step up, maybe a small hop with one
foot, it just was... lacking in its performance. When I wrote, not only would it
leave a very noticeable white mark at the end of every stroke (very noticeable),
it would also have this issue where it would occasionally leave a clear mark in
the middle of the stroke (where the ink wasn't applied and instead went to the
sides), which was a little annoying. As I said, it was a slight improvement but I probably am going to next buy the
Sakura gelly roll and see if that's better than this. TLDR: Pen was okay. Nothing amazing as I would've expected of 4.7 stars. Had
two major issues, and the pigment of the white didn't really impress me. Won't
be buying another, I really wished this was a good pen and I could've left a
better review :/"

Arika R,"May 17, 2018",Great pen to add detail! Very opaque!
dhrabik,"May 15, 2018","I like the way the white ink is so opaque making a nice contrast as a liner on
watercolor."
jhicks61,"May 10, 2018",The best 'white' pen out there. Use this one all the time.
jo.noble,"May 3, 2018",Love this pencil! It is amazing for highlighting!
sabrina.fielden,"April 17, 2018","Works, but not very pigmented. Still will show well enough though"
clee525,"April 9, 2018","These are the juiciest “paint-like” white pens I have ever used.  Love 5em. 
Totally worth trying!  Look great on Black Paper. Can be used for watercolor
touch ups or highlights. Excellent. "
MWIllustrations,"April 4, 2018","First time trying the product and I have to say it's really smooth. I got the
gold pen earlier and this white one is great for highlights too."
cmerinoart,"April 4, 2018","A nice pen to write with on dark surfaces and even on top of watercolor
paintings."
lisacurryabc,"April 3, 2018","The Uni-ball white gel pen is really the only white pen anyone would ever need. 
Solid opaque saturation with great ink flow. I use it over acrylic paint and
spray inks as well as on black card stock. It’s a staple for any crafter."
maureenbearden,"March 30, 2018",Lots of dark envelopes to address with this oen
shanaeh31,"March 28, 2018","The ink flow is really good and it's not transparent like other gel pens that I
bought before"
florie,"March 25, 2018","My favorite white pen of all time, perfect for highlights in drawings! I run
through these alot and they always leave bright, clean white marks! I've tried
several others and none get the job done for me like this one does. Highly
recommend!"
veckizyt123,"March 19, 2018","Very smooth and opaque, has a good amount of ink inside of it and is great over
copics and watercolor. "
Nic with the pens,"March 17, 2018","I saw some wonderful reviews about this pen, but unfortunately, I found it less
smooth than I thought. I may have just gotten a bad pen. I still love Uni-ball
Signo pens, and I'm not going to give up on their white pens! "
moose,"March 9, 2018","My favorite white pen to date. It doesn't skip over pencil marks like many that
I've tried do and doesn't smear when erased. Nice and bright and perfect for
highlights on coloured art paper."
Athena PN,"March 6, 2018","I tried both this 1mm white pen, and Uni-ball Signo's .7mm pen for addressing
black envelopes and this UM-153 is definitely superior to it's .7mm little
brother. This pen lays down a lovely, dense white line: it can take a bit of
time to dry depending on the paper you're using, but it's worth it. Particularly
when addressing dark envelopes or writing on dark papers, this white ink pen
will not disappoint!"
leandraedelson,"February 26, 2018","Very inky, but it's still pretty opaque and smooth."
alesvfullerton,"February 23, 2018","Fades a bit after it dries down, but I don't hate it!!"
abzhao100,"February 23, 2018","Before this white gel pen I bought the one from ""Ranger"" in Michaels. Honestly
that pen disappointed me and I felt nervous trying out the uni-ball, but after
buying it I found out that it's great! The only thing is that the ink was
thicker than I thought (almost 1mm) , but not mentioned anywhere in the
description."
dcounce,"February 6, 2018","I highly recommend the Uni-ball Signo Broad White gel pen!!  It's the best one
that I've tried.  I use it in journaling and watercolor and craft projects."
dreamer0201,"February 2, 2018","My very first gel pen. A friend recommended that I get a white gel pen to use
with my art journaling. I had been using white china markers and white colored
pencils, so didn't think I needed more. But, I was ordering one of the pen
samplers and thought, what the heck, just add the gel pen. I'm hooked now! And
the quality is amazing. "
tentcomm,"January 31, 2018","Really opaque, wonderful quality! Perfect for the projects I needed it for."
j.icecubz,"January 31, 2018","This white gel pen is the best white ink gel pen I have. I have the pilot juice
pen but its more see through. This pen is more solid and a more concentrated
color."
lorimara,"January 30, 2018","The very best white gel pen! Smooth and covers well usually with two coats.
I’d like to have a white glitter or metallic though. "
isabellarose1211,"January 25, 2018",Writes very smooth 
deirdre.woodard,"January 13, 2018",an excellent choice. very white opaque color.
randomgirlxrulz,"January 6, 2018","The hype is well deserved. I didn't think such an opaque white could exist
outside of paint!"
brushpenaholic,"January 4, 2018","This pen is either overrated or I have the worst of luck when I buy them. I
believe I've bought around 3 in the past and all of them had awful ink flow that
was never consistent. It would always skip or the ink become more thin and not
cooperate with me. It also sucks up alcohol ink from Prismacolor markers,
turning the gel ink into that color, entirely defeating the intended purpose. It
looks nice on paper on its own, and it looks nice when you first buy it, but
it's by no means a workhorse of a pen. I recommend them with caution for use on
their own but not for art. Maybe try buying them when they're first restocked in
order to get a fresh batch?"
astein,"January 3, 2018","I wanted to love this pen. (I love the gold and silver and navy blue!) But this
white pen clogged up during first use and I haven't been able to get it to write
since."
bridagibbons17,"January 2, 2018","i use this pen like white out for really small details!! it’s great for
perfectionists like me and it’s super pigmented and convers completely!!"
adreanaline,"January 1, 2018",Excellent opaque white ink. More opaque than most similar white gel pens!
alexandria_bermudez,"December 30, 2017",I'm happy that the ink is so bright. It stands out where I need it to.
artorelse,"December 29, 2017",A must for adding highlights to your work. Amazing!
crosales,"December 29, 2017","I love, love, love this pen.  It was my first intro to Signo UM-153 Gel Pens and
still my favorite for my greeting cards.  I buy them in multiples."
pennerd,"December 26, 2017","It's pretty good in the beginning, but once it's half out of ink it starts to
become less smooth and opaque. You can't really highlight over Tombows or
watercolors unless you let them dry for several days without having the white
ink get tinged with the base color. "
Thomas,"December 21, 2017",amazing white pigmented pen. very smooth and always consistently and flowing 
Anixancy,"December 19, 2017","A wonderful white ink pen that so creamy and opaque! I use this pen often for my
ink drawings and watercolors and it never disappoints. If I could complain about
anything about the pen, is that there is no white ink refill and that Uni has
yet to release a smaller or needle tip size of this pen! "
disturbia0509,"December 15, 2017",Everyone loves this for a reason! Great white pen! 
Quichi,"December 15, 2017",Good pen. Will see if it clogs like my other white gel pens.

with it to get it to write."
Sara,"November 21, 2017",BEST WHITE INK PEN EVERRRR!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!
Thinkerstonpie,"November 20, 2017","This is a beautiful gel based pen. It is certainly an all time favorite. It goes
over every medium, so far, it is certainly worth the money spent if you can't
find it anywhere in stores."
Usagikid,"November 18, 2017","This pen is great if you're an artist and want some portable white ink that you
can just toss in your pencil case!"
mcarmeli,"November 16, 2017",very opaque. would be nice if they made a light and mid gray version
Nelsoart,"November 13, 2017","It's good but, it's a diva pen. the white out is good and the line is good but
can mix easily with layers below so make sure everything is dry. wouldn't really
recommend if your doing comics or illustrations. Good for sketches but not
professional work. If you want a good pen to use on finished work, look to the
Uni Posca Paint marker. "
Zaac,"November 10, 2017","This is my favorite white pen or white ink, hands-down.  The glossy texture
makes it really fun to doodle on post-its while at meetings or waiting for a
program to load at work, and I've been satisfied with every ink drawing I
highlighted with this guy."
Zane,"November 9, 2017","Im very impressed. I have seen alot of hype about the this pen and WOW is it
opaque. Its like white-out in a pen. It even writes well and smoothly on
plastic. I would HIGHLY recommend."
caterpillarella,"November 1, 2017","The ink doesn't dry and ""sit"" on the page like it should, but rather seeps into
the paper. I continue to chase the creamy opaque gels from the early-00s."
pjsiehs,"November 1, 2017",I love this pen!!!
lhern,"November 1, 2017","skips a lot, but when you get it to work, the ink comes out thick and vibrant"
Missy,"October 30, 2017",Best white ink pen I've ever used!
nekofiredragon,"October 26, 2017","They work just fine for me! Make sure to check the size if you tend to work
small though,as it's not a SUPER fine tip (such as a small micron), so the
highlights might be too big. "
wendellxe,"October 21, 2017","Terrible as a correction pen and poor for general purpose writing. I wanted a
white gel pen to use as a detailed correction pen. From reading many reviews,
the Signo seemed to be the best option, but it actually does not work at all for
covering gel ink. It picks up the ink from the paper, leaving a colored blob of
goo on the paper and a stain on the pen tip. Also, the white ink never
completely dries. Even after letting it sit for days, it feels soft and white
paste comes off on my fingers. This is my first white gel pen, so I don't know
how much worse other white pens are and why the Signo is so highly rated. But
considering it just as a correcting pen or general purpose writing instrument,
it's awful."
s.smilanich,"October 18, 2017","Just exactly what I was expecting from the 5-star reviews and online writing
samples."
sonia.wagner,"October 17, 2017","Our company uses these pens to write on black rubber products and we have never
found anything comparible.Have ordered multiple times and always receive quickly and in working order.
Thanks for taking great care of thiscustomer."
chupchup,"October 15, 2017","the best white gel pen i've ever bought. I tend to do a lot of ink drawings and
like to use a bit of white for highlights and this is perfect. The ink is
consistent and smooth."
nicolechin197,"October 12, 2017","It’s a good, solid white gel pen; I can use it as white out too"
candysphynx,"October 10, 2017","My go to white gel pen for touch ups and highlights on illustrations. Very

morphis40,"September 16, 2017",Great white pen
mbashford,"September 14, 2017","Smooth ink, bright white pen!The ink flow is the main draw of this pen. It writes with ease on many types of
paper without much drag.The ink reservoir does appear to be running low only after a small amount of use
so I feel like this pen will not last too long if used a lot.Beats the Sakura Gelly Roll in my opinion due to the smooth ink flow."
28pwilson,"September 11, 2017","If you write very slowly you get a consistent line quality. The broad tip
provides a denser white line."
MdgColorado,"September 8, 2017","Nice for what it is. (3 stars is what I give for a product that performs as
expected). Does not work as a whiteout pen for fountain pens, but I did not
downgrade for something that is not its intended use."
Near Zero,"September 8, 2017","Not as good as some people claim.  I belive the Sakura white pen is better.  I
have issues with this clogging all the time.  "
snitchykitty,"September 7, 2017","Gorgeous, I'm really happy with this pen! The ink comes out thick and opaque. If
you're looking to do fine details this probably isn't the best. The ink also
pools a bit, especially at the end of a stroke so the consistency can look a bit
funky depending on your usage. "

pens couldn't handle!"
skywilling,"August 22, 2017","Very broad tip, but also very opaque and the tip hasn't dried up on me unlike
the other ones I got, so this is my favorite white gel pen so far."
peachbutter,"August 17, 2017","I don't know if I got a defective pen, but the ink in this skips so much and
creates a ""line"" in the middle of the ink (where the ballpoint is basically
rubbing off the ink). It drives me nuts. The ink itself is very opaque, but since the ink doesn't come
out properly it's pretty much useless! "
mireke,"August 17, 2017","Covers other colors well, but requires patience to get a smooth steady line. "
peggysomers,"August 15, 2017",great - adds nice highlights
essipark,"August 11, 2017","Great for thick, opaque white lines. It's not as white over water-based markers

markers."
marvista66,"August 4, 2017",Love this pen!  I use them in my art journaling and mixed media work.
susantaylorbrown,"August 4, 2017","My go-to white pen. I use this almost every day so I have to keep a nice stock
on hand. It writes a nice opaque white over just about everything."
amaicha1237,"August 1, 2017","I absolutely love this gel pen! I had been using the Sakura Gelly Roll as my
white pen of choice, and while it's tip is finer, I get a much better result

this to anyone, especially if you don't mind the larger tip size."

Fish,"June 28, 2017","I like how thick and rich the white in these pens are. They're the most opaque
of all the white I've tried, but they also tend to dry out fast, so it gets 4/5.
Still worth it for a handy on the go white."
ruoxuanshao,"June 28, 2017","The best white pen I've used! The only gripe I have is that sometimes the ink
will react oddly if I write over water-based brush pens - this might have
something to do with waiting a while for it to dry though. "
patchworx13,"June 26, 2017",Best white ink pen out there. 
angle13_13,"June 26, 2017","I bought one of these years ago, and hated it, because it never flowed smoothly.
The cartridge that one was mixed with yellow gunk, and must have been faulty.
I'm glad I took a chance and bought a new one, because this is the best, most
opaque white pen I've ever used. I'm annoyed I spent so long using Sakura Gelly
Roll. My only complaint is that the ink on this broad nib version flows out very
quickly, making it impossible to use for small details, besides dots.  "
kellysmom2,"June 23, 2017","This is an awesome pen!! I used it to highlight around wording on wood and it
worked amazingly! I will definitely be ordering another..Thanks!"

dcnewman52,"June 12, 2017",Love these pens for mixed media work!
Awakened1,"June 10, 2017","I was desperately in need of a white gel pen for two reasons: 1. to have the
white in my artwork truly stand out, and 2. as a color eraser for those
UN-slightly coloring mishaps. Using as a dry gel ink tend to be a bit too bold of a white and was a bit chalky
at times (once dried), but seemed a lot smoother; not so harsh when used with
water and applied with an artist brush application; the blending had a much
softer achievement and dabbing excess water first made it dry in half the time.
The finish results, flawless.  As a color eliminator I didn't achieve as much success as I wanted; thinking to
use a white marker with a larger tip size might work best. The size of the tip is a nice size; and allowed me to have much more control,
than a larger size tip head. It produces a truly nice shade of white (light hand
vs a heavy hand) and the pen itself is of great quality; it doesn't come off as
being cheaply made. The pen has a comfortable grip to it, so it won't slip while
applying. I have not used as a white pencil alone; that wasn't my intention upon buying. Cons: The gel ink does tend to bleed a bit, but not too heavily in order to control.
Will definitely smudge if not completely dry. I kept accidentally leaving
imprints of ink on the side of my hand which bled onto the page and my design
background; not an happy experience in deed, I assure you-you will learn quick
not to keep making this mistake.    ** I am a colorist, not the original illustrator. Addt'l Pros     Easy to use    Has a nice comfort grip to one's writing/coloring    Glides Smoothly    Smudge when not dry    Erases good but not perfect"
Karlenia,"June 2, 2017","It is a good white gelpen, but if you plan on using it with copics, note that
when you use it with very dark or even very saturated colors it is slighty
transparent and not fully opaqe white."
Candasfreeman,"May 31, 2017","This is THE BEST white gel pen out there!! I've tried LOTS!! If not all of them
and I keep coming back to this one.Why??The ink flows, it's not gloppy, splotchy, or stop and start-y, it doesn't dry up
in the pen, the point is perfect every time, the price is right, on paper the
ink dries quickly, it's a bright white even on black paper, not some watered
down milky white, and it's comfortable in my grip.This is MY favorite white gel pen, BY FAR!!"
KimberlyInOhio,"May 29, 2017","I got a few of these in different colors as I need to write on folders that have
dark colors like purple and navy. The ink seems to flow slowly, so it's hard to
get a good line on those folders. I have to really slow down my writing, but at
least I'm not writing black-on-navy!"
keithcieplinski,"May 26, 2017","This was just what I was looking for! Totally awesome. I needed a pen that could
fix minor mistakes and dot my eyes (drawings, of course) and wow! The ink is
smooth and bold and a little textured. I also use it for lettering on colored
paper. It's a great pen that I would recommend for anyone."
cosettehope,"May 23, 2017",Goes on most surfaces very smoothly
nermal,"May 18, 2017","This is a totally awesome pen I bought to use for highlighting drawings and
stuff and works perfectly for that no complaints, except that I end up using
more than I realize so ill be buying more soon. Something else is in school its
a fun prank to write white on white and hand in a worksheet or pass notes. I
ended up having to rewrite the entire worksheet in pencil but the look on my
teachers face trying to read it was worth it."
greg.shale,"May 18, 2017","Great for drawing on a dark painted surface. A lot easier then using a brush,
more precise."

to go with it."
rgmorgan01,"April 5, 2017","Always good to have white ink for that time when readability is critical again
that darker-than-dark photograph, watercolor, or mixed media creation!!"
montfortmum,"March 31, 2017",Very nice opaque white pen. I use it on red envelopes very effectly.
marshmallow_pie,"March 29, 2017","I use this pen every time I doodle. I can add patterns, details, or highlights
to anything I want and this particular pen has not given me problems that other
gel pens have in the past - the tip does not get clogged up, and it
progressively moves the ink down to the tip as opposed to some cheaper gel pens
that you will find. I happened to receive one of these in an #artsnacks box and
was overjoyed, as my original was getting close to the end of its life. I will
say that when I finish using this pen each time I use it, that I will make sure
to get any excess ink off by rolling the tip onto a scrap piece of paper, and if
there is any excess any higher on the tip, I will wipe it off. If you keep up
this habit, this pen will work wonders for you! "
Bonheur874,"March 24, 2017","These are the best white ink pens ever!  I absolutely love them.  They work
better than white out and I use them when making greeting cards.  One has to try
it to see the difference between this pen from others.  Amazing!"

kdayne614,"March 17, 2017","A very nice inky pen! I never feel like I'm wasting ink. It also came right on
time! My only ""complaint"" that I have is that the ink doesn't come out like how
I thought it would but I believe that's because of how I'm using it. A great
purchase, totally worth it."

I've been coloring.  This pen has come to my rescue several times!!"
elementalskkb,"March 8, 2017","This is the best white ink pen on the market, in my opinion.  I have ordered
from other sources in the past and someitmes the pens arrive with half of the
ink dried up in the barrel.  I have NEVER had that problem with JetPens.  A
wonderful compnay to do business with."
YuYuDance57,"March 7, 2017","I love this pen, it is so much better than the sakura gel pen. It is so opaque
and when it dries its still opaque. It writes very smooth and flows
effortlessly. Just make sure you have a good angle. It does however freeze up on
me. Yet, when it does, it's extremely easy to get it writing again. With the
sakura gel pen I would spend close to three minutes trying to get the ink
flowing and when it did it would stop working on me. With this pen it takes
three seconds, you just have to write it on your finger print and that's it. It
is a little too big sometimes for thin lines, but if you're trying to get  small
dots you don't have to worry about that."

rbos1963,"February 14, 2017",I love the uni-ball signo pens.They are great in art projects.
himebuns,"February 9, 2017","Great white gel pen, very opaque and lasts a long time. This is my second time purchasing it, because I have already run out of my other
one. Also, JetPens has an amazing price for it, compared to the $6 I spent on it the
first time on another website. "
Mickeyilue11,"February 4, 2017","My favorite brand of white gel pen, after Sakura. I find that this glides on
smoother than Sakura's white. Takes a bit longer to dry, but it's awesome on
black/dark paper."
reneexuereb,"January 27, 2017","Excellent pen.I have been searching for white markers and pens in order to
enhance my artwork for awhile. I am so happy that I purchased this item and will
highly recommend it to my artistic friends!"

This pen is second to none when it comes to the job!"
Spenser Fornal,"January 23, 2017","I definitely prefer these to the Sakura gelly/jelly rolls (? sorry if spelling
is incorrect) and am glad I picked this up!"
srbbass,"January 19, 2017",Bleeds through marker sometimes. 
karayogi,"January 19, 2017","All-time favorite white ink. You don't need to go over areas multiple times to
get fully opaque white lines."
pattrashiver,"January 17, 2017",Good quality!
Ilinca Mitchell,"January 15, 2017",Best white pen I've used so far for my ink/copic drawings.
Coonae,"January 14, 2017","Love this pen. Very thick, opaque line! The grip is incredibly soft and feels
great in my hand. I can see why this would be one of the most popular items on
here."
lori.bradford,"January 13, 2017","This is the best pen for white ink but it still will quit before it's empty.
Dont buy in bulk and expect them to work months later."
schilcote,"January 9, 2017",Nice broader stroke white ink pens being used on black paper tiles.
Laura,"January 7, 2017","The ink splays out a little so I can't do fine details on my art with it. The
ink also takes a little while to dry. I've been using fast drying pens for a
while so I forgot I need to wait a bit with other pens. Its still a good pen
that writes smoothly though."
rhondaroebuck,"January 3, 2017",Probably the best white pen!  Makes wonderful drawings on black paper.
magnum.wedding,"December 30, 2016","This is the best white pen I've ever gotten, I use it to highlight spots on
finished art. "
2crowes,"December 27, 2016","Works just as the JetPen review stated - flow is nice, needs time to dry.  Very
good purchase."
marybeth1942,"December 21, 2016","This pen by far is the white ink pen I need as it is opaque, goes on smoothly
and is a bright white."
Artsy13,"December 18, 2016","This is a perfect gel pen for anyone who needs a TRUE opaque white ink. I've had multiple Sakura White Gelly Roll pens, and all of them had consistant
problems with ink flow, lack of opacity, and scratchiness. The ink in those were
basically invisible, making the pen useless for art.Then I recieved this pen. The thick tip may be a problem for some, but for
manga, comics, or any drawing in need of highlights, this pen can not be
matched. It's amazing! I have had no problems with this pen and would reccomend
this to anyone."
evapishalski,"December 15, 2016",very pigmented and writes smoothly
Umbrella,"December 14, 2016","The ink is astonishingly white and opaque. It does have its moments when it
doesn't stand out as much or flow as nice but overall, it's a great pen. I'm
definitely buying it again."
Nico,"December 11, 2016","Clear, precise white that is opaque and wonderful. "
cayt27,"December 2, 2016","Nice rich white! The flow is smooth and the lay down is great. Sometimes I feel
like I could use it as a correction pen! I use it on my watercolors and my
drawings. It is the perfect white gel pen! Make sure you give it a moment to dry
so it stays perfect. :)"
zlin,"November 27, 2016",One of my favourite product by Uni
mcoote1,"November 13, 2016","This pen lays down a thick, smooth white line, and writes on almost anything. "
pickledproblem,"November 9, 2016","I'm absolutely in love. I've been dabbling in other gel pens, but none of them
seemed to have a solid substance to them. I saw reviews for this pen and thought
i'd give it a shot, never felt better to have done so. It is a full and solid
white and perfect when i want to add the finer touches in my works. Can't wait
to get more."
Maudie,"November 5, 2016","I bought one pen as a test. Usually I touch up drawings with a white gelly roll
pen but they can clog up or the color doesn't come out as vibrantly as I'd like
it to. Another artist suggested this pen and after trying it I can see a big
difference! It feels smooth when I use it and the color comes out nice and
bright. I'll definitely buy more in the future!"
llim,"October 29, 2016",Pros:*very vibrant on darker shades of paper*smooth consistency when writing 
Bepis,"October 29, 2016","It's a great pen and can make thick lines but it has a pasty look that just
isn't for me.I found it turned pink when I used it on red copics and sometimes
it was a little too see through for me.Other than that it's still pretty great
it dries really fast."
100 Friendly Bees,"October 11, 2016","it flows way better than my gelly roll does, and the ink is wonderfully bold and
thick : D if you're using a white pen to highlight over coloured drawings, this
is the one you want. gelly rolls absorb pencilcrayon and ink, so they just make goopy gray blobs.
this pen is great and very very white!"
RAPIDPUNCHES,"October 4, 2016",Super opaque. The only downside is it's not refillable.

Fierce dragon,"August 11, 2016","love the creamyness of the pen,no streaks like the sakura kind."

0099chan,"July 30, 2016","Such a minimalist and cutesy pen! You can feel the smoothness when writing and I
love it. It doesn't dry so quickly, so you gotta give it a minute to dry
completely :~)"
sharilynn.morse,"July 30, 2016","Bought this to do little accents in drawing and handlettering and it's the
perfect white gel pen for it. Flows smoothly, great pigment on top of other
colors. "
KimchiKicks,"July 25, 2016","I use this pen to highlight and white out ink and marker illustrations. It works
fantastic and has the perfect opacity for my art. I've learned to layer it and
allow it a minute to dry between strokes. Dries to a perfect stark white or a
veiled white for highlights. You can also use the ink on a bit of a brush too.
Spread nicely and easily forms into gaps/dents in paper too. "
jaws revenge,"July 21, 2016","very nice, i use for white out"
kierenalvarado8,"July 19, 2016","very good for fixing minor details, or adding little accents, but it will smear
with certain pens, which can be a bit of a pain."
iguanart,"July 11, 2016",Good covering ability. 
cynthiajane,"July 6, 2016","the color of this pen is so opaque. it's really nice for correcting mistakes but
that can sometimes change the color of the pen (making it greyish). other than
that it's a really like opaque white pen"
MarioMVDURY,"July 1, 2016",Finally I have a white ink pen that actually makes the ink flow. LOVE IT
Amarnaphiliac,"June 30, 2016","I got this pen after watching how well it worked for other people, but I find
the ink flow to be too slow when doing small objects rather than long continuous
lines. The ink does flux flatter than my other white gel pens."
origamikid,"June 29, 2016",So good. Writes over top most things. Very opaque. 
elisedavies1,"June 29, 2016","Some blotchy ink here and there. Good for highlighting areas. Also quite good as

good life for such thick lines."
jenice268,"June 23, 2016","Excellent gel pen! The best out there! Works well with my art journals and
letterings! Ink does not skip. If it does, all you have to do is gently tap the
tip of the pen against your finger and it will work nicely."
donnaicurtis,"June 11, 2016","I brought this pen in 4 colors.  I love the nice smooth writing.  It looks great
on black card stock. I want to order more to have extras."
roostermom1,"June 9, 2016",had fun writing all over an old denim jacket that I have.  Looks totally cool
vsock,"June 9, 2016","An average gel pen. Doesn't cover dark ink/pencil 100%- but for that you should
just go to the office store and grab some whiteout. Doesn't make blobs of ink on
the paper unless you really try for it."

jgregorybarton,"May 12, 2016",Great coverage. Just what I needed. 
Forest Y,"May 12, 2016","I bought this to use as a correction pen. The ink flow is awesome, but I have to
wait quite a while before I can write over it (I usually use a Uni-ball Signo or
Pilot Metropolitan), otherwise the undried ink will clump all over the tips of
my pens and prevent them from writing. It gets a little irritating having to
always wipe off all the clods of white ink. :( I think I might just use
correction tape rather than correction fluid... However, as an ordinary pen for writing, it's absolutely amazing! I can totally
see what all the hype's about! :)"
Zaac,"May 12, 2016","I love this pen. I bought it to fix a very specific mistake in a black and white
pen and ink illustration, and found that it worked really well.  I also find myself doodling victorian dress designs and wallpaper styles on
post-it notes with it at work.  The thick ink creates a smooth finish, and
linear designs on paper are very appealing not only on sight but also on touch.
I also find that the ink only goes exactly where I want it regardless of the
paper I'm using, which I was very worried about. All in all, I absolutely recommend this pen, either for
white-on-black/white-on-gray/white-on-color illustration or for corrections in
black ink work."
asdf,"May 11, 2016","I bought this pen after seeing so many instagram artists use and rave about it.
I figured I would try a different white pen since my sakura jelly roll died on
me and I had faith in this pen. At first, the ink seemed to glide more smoothly
than the sakura one, but I noticed it was not completely opaque and required
several coats. After looking back at my older sketchbooks using this pen, I
noticed that the sketches made with coloured inks' highlights turned into a
lighter shade of the ink color. My sketches with my purple pens' highlights
turned into a light purple colour. Most of my sketches are made with pens and I
never tested it much with copic markers, but the thickness of the tip and the
transparency led me to toss this pen.If you're looking to add highlights to your PENCIL sketches, this is a great
pen. If you use coloured inks like me, try a different one."
lucia,"May 10, 2016","Super opaque and a nice smooth line, but it runs out so fast! Maybe I just use

delivered  fast."
mecanders,"May 5, 2016","Works well, smooth use, flows evenly, doesn't stop up. Mostly opaque, though a
little color can show through, looks a bit dull on black. the moisture can
reactivate watercolors, which can be annoying, but it solvable by using faster
strokes and 2 coats to cover any visible color."
JazzyCA69,"May 3, 2016","I purchased this and it works very well on a dark blue file folder.  No
skipping, Writes great.  "
ehales1352,"May 3, 2016","I absolutely love this white pen. Most white markers or pens I've purchased in

luckyshadow58,"March 2, 2016","This pen is really smooth and very nice to use, love it "
juliejet,"February 29, 2016","The ink itself is fantastic. The reason I'm not giving this pen five stars is
because on both of the ones I have, the plastic body casing eventually cracked
and because you want to get the ink started on a piece of scrap paper. Since I
use this on top of watercolor paintings, I can't afford for it to be anything
but perfect. However, once you figure out all the little tricks, this pen is
great. "
milly91311,"February 26, 2016","Where do I even start? This gel pen is one of the most smoothest pens I ever owned! The ink is very

azelf,"February 17, 2016","This is a great multipurpose pen! It's very opaque and the ink flows pretty
smoothly (although sometimes I have to run it on paper to get ink flowing
first). I have used it on many different surfaces besides paper, and besides
correcting/whiting out it's also good for decorating binders/notebooks and nail
art! I believe it would also be good for touching up white furniture where paint
has chipped or flaked off, but I haven't tried that personally. "

katiejeanne13,"February 15, 2016","THIS PEN is the bomb!  It writes perfectly and fluidly onto the surface.  No

fahele,"January 8, 2016","These pens are just great when making cards and a must-have item.  It is
necessary to at least one that will write, but I do find that all too often the
pens stop writing when they are still practically new and quite full of ink.  If
you or someone could tell me how to get them going again, I'd really appreciate
it.  I have a fistful of them here that gave up after a very short time and have
tried all ways to get them going again."
mizu1,"January 7, 2016","This white gel pen writes nice and opaque, not watery. So far, of the few white

courtney n,"November 5, 2015","this pen, honestly, is one of the best purchases i've made!after seeing that artists that i enjoy and / or respect have praised this up and
down, i decided to make the plunge and buy one for myself. the ink is very
opaque, and hardly skips on most surfaces. i've used this over watercolors, ink,
construction paper, etc. and this has held up throughout countless pieces. i've
used this for outlines, highlights, details, and other things, and this pen
shows up beautifully!i must say that, while it isn't the pen's fault per say, sometimes the ink
doesn't completely cover what it's supposed to (construction paper tends to soak
up the paper without leaving complete opacity, and over colorful ink, the pen
doesn't cover it in one layer). however, just going over the trouble spots
always creates the desired effect again!so yes! while this pen has some (minuscule) faults, i fullheartedly recommend
this pen! i've bought one before, and i'm about to buy another soon!"
caledscratch,"November 2, 2015","I bought two of these pens as they were one of the highest recommended white
pens from JetPens, and they do not disappoint! They make a great white line over
black brush pen inks which has been great for drawing. Their design is also very
pretty, in my opinion."
rschoenrock07,"November 2, 2015","The ink is certainly the most opaque of my white pens, but the ball-point tends

marme93,"October 22, 2015","I've had this pen recommended countless times and I've wanted to buy it for so
long. I finally have my hands on it and it is beyond what I expected. Most gel
pens skip after a little use but this one does not. The white is gorgeous as
well. Definitely an amazing pen."
ichigokitty,"October 21, 2015","Love this perfect for detailing on art and highlighting and fixing up mistakes
with pen sometimes like liquid paper but not as thick but if your using it on
achocol based marker drawing it'll adsorb the ink abit if you let it dry for
afew days it doesn't that much "

airamfdjo,"October 13, 2015","Got get another one, nice, smooth and even coat of ink."
necrocrunk,"October 12, 2015","I love this gel pen, but it runs out pretty fast. It lays down a heavy, thick
line and doesn't pretend to be out of ink like most gel pens. My only complain
is it soaks into my ink and picks up colors from my inks under it. it's good to
do a second layer of ir when doing highlights, but is good for going over
blemishes."
Separisa,"October 10, 2015",Perfect! Best of my white gel pens =)
natalieglittershark,"October 5, 2015","It's hard to find a really opaque white gel pen, but this one is excellent, and
the ink dries pretty quickly. I use it to do corrections on b/w ink artwork and
add white on top of paintings. My only issue is that the ink seems to be running
out pretty fast, but I have been using it a lot. I'll definitely replace it when
it's depleted."
mattnelson,"October 3, 2015","Great bright highlights with this pen. Sometimes it takes a little finesse to
get the ink flowing nicely, especially over waxy media like colored pencils. I
like it better than Gelly Roll."
sketchingmonsters,"October 1, 2015","Better than a competitor's pen . . . The Uni features thick, opaque ink that
works for fast, minor corrections. Again, Jet Pens is an amazing retailer and
shipper. I will definitely buy this pen again!"
prmccormack,"October 1, 2015",Really like it. Ink takes longer to dry than I expected causing some smudging.

rockabillyriot,"August 31, 2015","This white ink pen is incredible - I've written on photographs, card stock,

for gorgeous finished projects."

batinks,"August 6, 2015","After being irrationally excited for a white pen, I was definitely not let down
by this one! It glides very smooth and covers paints and leads fully, its not
translucent like some white pens can be and doesn't take multiple strokes to get
that way. The tip can get goopy and splotch the piece if you're not careful,
such is the nature of a gel pen. Overall, will definitely be buying more! "
slipcat,"August 6, 2015","nice fine white lines to mix into your drawings.   They are pretty fine,  so you
may not notice them unless you do several.   Good for softening areas in black
and white drawings. "
Tsukihime26,"August 5, 2015","The white ink in this pen is very opaque and writes wonderfully! Compared to my
Sakura Gelly Roll pen, I think this one is better in terms of opacity and it's
perfect for adding some ""pop"" to my manga and other art pieces. The white even
stays opaque once the image is scanned! I've had experience where the white ink
from my Sakura Gelly Roll didn't stay so opaque while scanning but the Uni-ball
stayed opaque, which pleasantly surprised me. Hopefully Uni-ball makes this pen
in smaller sizes like .3 or .05 for fine detailing."
small bug,"August 4, 2015","the description is spot on with the ""correction fluid consistency"". its
personally not my slice of cake, but its a nice pen. better for bigger details,

M Murphy,"July 24, 2015","Definitely the best white pen I've use. Great for adding details and highlights
to copic art, and once dried I can go over it with some copic and it will take
on a lighter shade of the color I used, so I can layer details really well. "

dark paper. I've tried other white ink pens, and this one is significantly more
opaque. "
thirdpotato,"July 13, 2015","This one's a pretty good white pen, but if you're an artist hoping to add some
highlights to your inks, go for the Sakura Gelly Roll. This one has more 'solid'
ink, but it tends to build up on the page and isn't ideal for inking over,
particularly with metal pen nibs. It's got a nice, rich white to it on the plus
side, and might be good for tiny stipple effects, but again, not great if you
plan to draw over it again. "
GIANT SQUID,"July 13, 2015","This is a must have for sketching. Add highlights, or a quick border to a
drawing and it makes it look more complete. I already need a new one."
gnmelento,"July 9, 2015","i used to swear by the white Gelly roll pen.  This white pen blows the doors off
the Gelly Roll.  WOW.It's almost like a correction fluid in a pen.  It came
recommended by another artist and I am glad I bought a few of these."
stinkyFur,"July 8, 2015","This pen is amazing. Super opaque and smooth. Doesn't skip. It is my GO TO pen
for writing on darker paper for my journaling. And even tho it writes thick, it
seems to last a long time. It's been 7 months and it's just now starting to get
low. And I write with it  ALL THE TIME. I LOVE this pen. Highly recommend. I
have other brands that write okay, but I have to go back over the words multiple
times. Not so with this little bad boy. Thumbs up!"
pughugs2001,"July 6, 2015","Amazing pen!! White ink is very thick. So far, with my experience with this, it

MaEaCa,"June 30, 2015","This is my first white gel pen, but I love this.  This for sure isn't a
precision pen, the line is a bit thick, but it is very white.  Looks great on
black paper and works good for corrections without looking really out of place."
liz.frakes,"June 30, 2015","This pen allows me to add the best finishing touches. That sparkle in the eye,
white highlights in the hair or on water. It's awesome. Very opaque and very
versatile."

cjason,"June 27, 2015","Very nice pen.  Ink flows smoothly and goes on bright white.  I would recommend
use with this pen for larger lettering.  When trying to use with smaller writing

magfer1947,"June 9, 2015",great! TY for a great service
Maria,"June 8, 2015","Man, this pen is magical. It is very opaque and requires only one layer to
provide complete coverage. However, the only downside is that on some inks (aka lineart blacks, from what
I've experiences) and markers, the color will bleed through and even many coats
won't help. For example, alcohol based markers (copics, promarkers etc.) that
are either bright (yellow, reds, blues) or very dark (black) will tint this
white ink, so trying it on some scrap paper first will be best."
nbruno81,"June 4, 2015",Best white pen ever! A staple in my craft room!

jerreb97,"May 23, 2015","I have tried and tried with this pen in the past.  Finally a art-journaler gave
a tip which worked and now I'm rolling.  It is so fun to write in white on
bright backgrounds.  I'm finally happy with my white pens!"
Robb,"May 22, 2015","I specifically bought this to write on black post it notes, which it does
perfectly. After reading some of the other reviews here I started to use it as a
replacement for white out and it is even better at that than I could have hoped.
It does not build up like the liquids from different manufactures and it is
easier to carry than a bottle of correction fluid or correction tape.Yet another reason to look around the Jet Pens site and find out what you didn't
know that you needed."
fuzzyprint,"May 20, 2015","The texture is milky indeed. This pen works well with rough/pourous papers. Not
good for smooth or gloss papers (I was using this to sign comic books).I give it one-less star since sometimes that milky ink needs a whoooollle lot of
time to dry."

jean_huth,"May 6, 2015","Great white gel pen! Does really well on colored paper, but not over marker
(soaks in). Only 4 stars because it takes a little bit of effort to keep it from
making blobs on the paper. However, if you write slowly and evenly with it, it
is great. I will continue to buy these for my art and art journaling!"

lightning spaniel,"April 17, 2015","The most opaque white gel pen I've used.  The ink isn't thick enough to replace

nickdongas,"April 13, 2015",I like it.
DiazArtist,"April 13, 2015","When it works it works great, but lots of these white ink pens seem to feel
clogged or you need to clean the tip regularly with your finger. I haven't seen
many that are used rigorously with textured or repeated overlapping lines work
very well. It becomes more of a broken line type of work. Perhaps if you work a
little more patiently then maybe the lines come out more smoothly."
lina,"April 10, 2015",Awesome opacity. Smooth writing... GREAT PEN!  Uni-ball never disappoints me.
theemberhold,"April 9, 2015","These are fantastic pens to use for white highlights and correcting small

this again."

it looks beautiful on brown/kraft paper. I highly recommend this product! "
akefiasgirl,"March 26, 2015","It's good for adding highlights to your art. When adding highlights in eyes with

jordan,"March 10, 2015","This pen puts down a fat line of thick gel ink.  I could not ask for more from a

writing on the dark inside cover of my field notes."
Nattosoup,"March 8, 2015","I LOVE these pens!  Usually gel pens, especially white gel pens, dry up so fast
on me, and end up ruining the inks that I'm trying to correct.  Not these! 
These pens last for a long time, and the white gel is very opaque.  Once it's
dry, you can ink over it again, and it wont reactivate.  Perfect for comic
artists.  I tend to buy these in bulk- 10 per order, because they're always
needed."

romevi86,"March 4, 2015","A versatile white-out pen. Got this pen primarily to act as a more precise
white-out and it works--at least with specific inks and colors.For now I’ve been working with J. Herbin black ink on a Black n’ Red
notebook. While I usually just cross mistakes, I thought I’d give a few some
white-out treatment.I used the pen and it was a fine experience, though, because of the nib I used
to write the actual text, I had to go over the original error a few times as the
Uni was slightly thinner. Still, it covered it just fine, though part of it was
still a little visible through the white ink."
josh.hollingshead,"March 2, 2015","The white ink does not come out thick bright white as expected. It is more thin

anjelika,"February 23, 2015","this is, in general, a very nice pen. the ink has a rly creamy consistency and
is almost paint-like, and u have to let it dry for a few seconds after use, but
i honestly dont mind bc it doesnt smudge at all. if u do use this with a black
ink pen i advise u to make sure the black ink has dried completely bc some of it
might mix with the white ink bc it has happened to me once. it was barely
noticeable tho so i didnt mind much :,) anyways i still rly enjoy this pen and
if u want it for art i recommend it for lineart instead of detail, just bc of
the broader tip!! writing is absolutely fine. "

Howard Tayler,"February 11, 2015","I use this for ""correction"" of inked line-art. It's not nearly as gritty as
liquid paper from correction pens, and it flows better. Also, I can use it to
knock out bits of lines, and add white atop black for effects like starfields,
energy pulses, etc. Note: If the black ink under it is not completely dry, you'll get a puddle of
grey gel. Not ideal. "

watercolor/ink painting and this is the best white pen for it"
perrinog,"January 31, 2015","Fantastic coverage of both black paper and black ink.  (The best coverage of any

brightworkpress,"January 22, 2015","My favorite gel pen for doing corrections on ink drawings and lettering. It
covers very well in one coat. The nib is a little fat, which gives you great
flow, and makes covering larger areas quick, but if you need to do white
hairlines, you'll need to find a finer point gel pen like the Gelly Roll. The
Uni-ball Signo is the better pen, but the Gelly Roll is finer"

jmmartins,"October 23, 2014","This is the best pen ever!  It is great for writing on colored materials and it
has a nice size, 1.0 mm!  I use it on my Silhouette too, I make sketches and
verses using the Silhouette Cameo.  (I have adapters that I use on the Cameo so
that I can use different size pens).  This white pen is my favorite pen, I also
have all the other colors of the UM-153.  Love it!!!"

studio,"October 19, 2014","Very nice white pen. It's an opaque white, yet fine enough for thin lines and
dots (I use it to add white highlights on watercolor paintings).I purchased the thinner Signo Angelic as well, intending to use it for thinner
lines, but found myself using the Signo Broad for everything."
hosannadog,"October 17, 2014",My favorite white pen.
indigo,"October 14, 2014","Among artists, there are constant pen reviews of which pen gives the best ""white
ink"".  Hands down, I think that this one is the bomb.  It writes a smooth line,
the white is pure white and it gives great coverage over the paper.  I use this
one over black ink or on black paper and the pen will produce the proper white
highlights that I need for my art journals.  If you are looking for a great
white ink pen for an art journal.  Stop.  This is it."
SofieF,"August 2, 2014","NOT A CORRECTION PEN!!!!! I bought this thinking it would be a great white out
pen, but alas it is not. It took well over four layers of ink to white out a
small section of black ink, and even then it didn't fully cover the black.
What's more, it takes WAY to long to dry, and if the layer of ink you are trying
to conceal is just a bit wet, this pen will smudge and take on the other color. 
      On the up side, it works finely on black paper, and is pretty good for
shining on a drawing.    If you are looking for a correction pen, this is
definitely not it... Please please PLEASE let me know if you have a good one!! "
v.alvokasis,"June 13, 2014","When correcting things I wrote or drew with certain pens, mostly ball point pens
for some reason, it just turns it a bit opaque and looks blueish/purple even
though it had been done with black ink. Personally, I don't find it too great
for actually correcting mistakes. But on a Sharpie covered or dry water painted
surface, it's pretty nice. Copics not so much, there's a little bit of the
colour that shows through it. Good for those little shiny points or little snow
droplets art wise. For the price I'm pretty happy with what I got. It's really
fun to use and great as a starter having never used anything white ink before. I
usually hate anything gel-pen like, but this is excellent. It flows nicely
almost all the time."
kyaaaaaaaaaah,"May 14, 2014","I am hooked to this one...Too bad I only bought one. However this is for detailing. I think the Sharpie is worth looking at too (for
broader surfaces)."
richardpace,"March 19, 2014","This was a surprisingly good white gel ink pen.  I never expected to seriously
consider using one in my artwork before now. It covers ink from other pens and markers well and actual inks remarkably well. I'll be endeavouring to keep these in stock for my own use. "
Kadejahhooks,"March 17, 2014","First off I must say I love Jetpens.com because they are a really good site if
you are looking for great products at amazing prices, but lets talk about this
pen. the Uni-ball Signo broad Gel Ink Pen in white is actually a pretty nice
pen, I love the design of the pen it looks really fancy in my little art tools
collection, however I can say I'm a little bit ticked off with this pen because
it does skitch up on me from time to time whenever I try to add some slight
detail to a picture, so I would have to shake the pen, write on a piece of scrap
paper, or even (I know this is probably bad) placed it on my tongue just to get
it to write again. I guess the moisture is what it needed cause the tip might
get a wee bit dry. That's my biggest peeve about this pen so far, now mind you
if you are looking for a great white gel ink pen to do details with this might
be, or may not be for you. Because this pen does have some really thick gel ink
so you might want to work with it, depending on the person. Me personally I
don't mind having this pen in my collection, but only if I'm doing a big picture
that needs a lot of white ink on it, however I should invest in something a bit
smaller all due to the fact that this pen seems like it's more heavy duty, where
I'm looking for something that is light duty.  Would I recommend this pen to anyone? Sure why not, only thing is that it does
skitch (Track, dry up, stop working for a moment) so if you don't mind the
slight skitch then you should get it. "
tinysissy99,"February 16, 2014","I enjoy to use white pen for my Zentangle arts with black background.  It's nice
but the shipping is outrageous!  You should weigh it for postal postage because
the pen is very light.  "
daphilss,"January 26, 2014","Worst Pen I've Ever Used.  When I first got this pen it seemed to work ok for a few weeks. It's not
something I used often, only to add hotspots to highlights on my renderings. But
after a few uses the pen became barely usable. Not sure if I just got a
defective cartridge or something, but it is almost impossible to lay down a line
or even a single dot of ink. I have to scribble the pen on a piece of paper to
get the ink flowing, and even then it barely comes out. In the end, I can't use
it. However, considering the amount of positive reviews, I suspect I just got a
dud."
romevi86,"January 8, 2014","An excellent little white pen, though wetter than I’d like. Of course, it
doesn’t perfectly substitute for white-out, as it takes a bit too long to dry
and the ink underneath is still visible, but it does the job if you’re in a
quick pinch and have run out of the real stuff. It’s a bit too liquidy for my taste, but a great white pen for writing on
black construction paper."
ram0n1sandoval,"November 12, 2013","This is the best white gel pen I've used. Excellent for drawing  on dark colors
or papers, and for cleaning up lines. And it can be colored over if necessary.
Lasts a long time, has not dried out, or the tip clogged. I've had this one for
2 years and am ordering more."
mad_bassist1,"July 7, 2013","This is a sweet pen! I bought it to use for an emergency/detail whiteout at
work, and also to sign the covers for my band's demo that are made of red paper
fed through a laser printer. For the latter use, it works beautifully. As an emergency whiteout, it works very well. Some color comes through as it's
not a true whiteout, but for quickly correcting pen mistakes it does the trick. I'll eventually try the .4mm Gelly Roll as another reviewer recommended, but I'm
happy with this one. The heavy plastic construction and white rubber grip make
it quite an attention-getter too."
sewunique85,"May 8, 2013","Best gel epn out there! Writes very smooth without skipping. White ink is

doxzgirl,"January 13, 2013","I LOVE, love, love, love, love, these pens, oh and did i mention that "" I LOVE

the moon happy with them. In fact iam placing my second order so that i can give
them to my friends in their valentine goody bags! they are going to be so happy
too :)"
taccora,"December 28, 2012","This is the best white ink pen I have tried (and I've tried a few).  Back in my
youth, when gel pens first hit the map and it was easy to find black paper, it
was easy enough to find a decent white and pastel gel pens that show up on
darker paper. In the last few years that has not been the case.  This is the reason why I made
my own notebook and filled it with black card stock and the hunt began to find
the perfect pen to use with it.  After a lot of fails, I gave this one a go and
I'll be back to by the pack of 25 as soon as the two I bought gets low. The broadness of this pens allows for an opaque white that contrasts beautifully
on black paper.  It writes smoothly and I haven't had any issues with any
patching so far.  I will say that because of the broadness of the ink, the ink
does take a little longer to dry.   That one downfall does not outweigh the awesome-ness (yes I made up a word) of
this pen!"
brad_commerce,"December 20, 2012","This is my favorite white ink pen so far. It is like an ultra-precise liquid

as a whiteout. I am excited to use this!"
slimmercat,"July 25, 2012","Better than I expected! I use this pen for corrections on my comic pages. It has the tendency to pick up
the color of & smear ink that's not completely dry, but as long as the ink under
it has had some time to dry, it blocks out black very easily. The ink is
smoother and more opaque than I expected, and it works as well as white-out. Two
layers is the maximum I've needed to block out spots of ink, and it easily draws
consistent white lines over areas of black."
nudgedtodeath,"May 31, 2012","This is the white gel pen you have spent years trying to find. Opacity is
unbeatable, clogging is non-existent, line is smooth. I've NEVER had a white gel
pen make it even halfway through it's ink before it just gave up and wrote no
more. The pen i bought months ago is going still going strong and hasn't skipped
out on me, even once.  I use this pen for cleaning up the edges of lettering, sloppy spots in sketches,
fixing smudges and errors in photocopies and to add details and highlights to
finished paintings and marker drawings and it performs perfectly. In the
interest of full disclosure i will mention that the line thickness may be a bit
high for some and yes, there are a few ink types that will bleed through. But,
for all the time and money i have spent over the many years since gel pens came
into existence trying to find a good white pen, these are very minor things to
me. This pen is awesome."
lessherger,"May 30, 2012","Best white pen for Art Journaling!I use this pen for art journaling. It writes over anything I use in my art

ebenfatto,"June 21, 2011","Nice opaque white, draws very smoothly, and dries well. (Like any white pen, you

many more pens they carry... perhaps one day :) Thank you for your awesome customer service and great selection!!!! I have listed your store on my blog and site... I want everyone to know about
your goodies!!! Have a wonderful day!!!!"
shindasagatanasu,"September 2, 2009","This pen is definitely the best white pen for artists. I use Copics and I've
been looking all over for a white pen where the ink will withstand the Copic
substances and not change color and dull as it dries... and I've finally found
it! I have another Uni-ball Signo that doesn't match up to this one at all. When
I use the other one, the ink changes color and looks really disgusting [I
figured I might as well start using white out]. However, this pen is really
amazing. The ink lays down very smoothly [although a smidge thicker than I'd
like, but that's due to the broad tip]. I just wish that this pen came in a
smaller point size for more detailed work. That's really my only complaint since
I do a lot of detailed work. The UM-153 is definitely worth the buy! Perhaps I
shall order the box of 10... The ink works very well over colored pencil as well
[even on waxy Prismacolors]! I really like this pen and hope to see Jetpens
carry maybe something as great as it, but perhaps with a smaller tip? :)"
queenkatherine,"July 3, 2009","Out of all the white pens I've tried/bought, I keep going back to this one. The
thickness of the line is fantastic, the ink is a great shade of white and truly
opaque, it lasts a long time, and doesn't dry up like the other white pens I
own. This is my very favorite white and I will never tire of using it. These
pens are total perfection - be prepared and buy yourself more than one. You'll
fall in love with it instantly!!"
jill_lory,"April 23, 2009","This is a wonderful pen, but I can not give it a 5 star rating. The white ink is very nice, but unlike what has been stated, it does
occasionally skip lines. The ink has also spilled into the container for a
reason I am still unaware of. This pen is still very good and worth buying. They're great for projects, and if
you're an artist, they can be used to add high lights for the cheeks, arms, and
etc."
dinasinger,"February 18, 2009","I think this is the best gel pen EVER if you are in school for acupuncture. We

smudge or wipe off all together...this one, if you let it sit for a moment, will
stay put but when you are ready to wash it off, it comes right off w/o leaving
messy pen all over someone's body! It is the best and shows up on all colors of
skin, both really pale and really dark."

watercolor paintings and copic drawings and it really holds up nicely. The white
is thick and opaque on black, but not clumpy. It's also very convenient to use

where I need a brush handy. Highly recommended! Great price and superior product!"
krider6,"November 21, 2008","LOVE THIS PEN!! I use a lot of scrapbooking papers for my art projects. The ink
in this pen does not absorb into the paper, it stays on the surface and looks
like it is freshly applied even after months. So far no cracking or flaking.  The Signo Broad writes very smoothly too. Always test the point before applying
and you will have flawless application. I have also used it for rubber stamp
fill in...looks great. And it is beautiful on black paper...which I use a lot
for accent and trim.  Just buy the pen...make it a couple because you will want more once you see the
results.  Krissy"

crafter or scrapper for outlining or highlighting and this one will do you
right! This shows well on any color and you will feel so creative using it. I'm
not sure why it is called a broad tip though, as it writes about the width of an
average ballpoint. LOVE it!!"

aoutorihan,"August 25, 2011","This is the best brush pen I have come across so far. I have tried out several after and before this one, and I must say, this really,
to me, is the best. I think comparing it with felt-tip brush pens isn't
necessary at this point, felt-tips just feel totally different than ""hair"" tips.
The feeling of authenticity can only really be conveyed via 'hair' tip brush
pens I think. Recently, I bought the Pentel Standard Brush Pen (tsumi tip - a little thicker
than the pocket brush pen) to have another hair/nylon tip to compare the pocket
brush pen with. I wrote a little review on it as well. This one still remains my
favourite. Both drawings and writing kanji works smoothly and beautifully, the ink is rich
and deeply black, it's waterproof (when I use a waterbrush on the writings, the
ink would run and a slightly pink background colour would appear with the
Standard Brush Pen, however with the Pocket Brush pen, nothing would happen
apart from the thin paper rippling)  All in all, I absolutely recommend this brush pen. I'm sure it will make you
happy."

is just phenomenal!..l like the poetry of a hand movement it follows so
beautifully,giving a hairy-thin line at the tip and that lovely,broken line when
you freely increase the pressure from time to time.Feels like some sort of a Zen
meditation,it really kinda dances in a hand.Best soft tipped brush pen l've used
so far and l could hardly believe that it could be beaten out someday."
sckraps,"August 18, 2010","I really enjoy the spring and snap of this pen. Although the ink can be
cumbersome under the ""wait until it's dry"" circumstance of adding watercolor, or
running my hand across my image (lefty here), the lines I can get from this pen
are always what I want. From hairline thin to thick, wet strokes.  I always carry this in my bag with my sketching items and the ink lines are
gorgeous on a nice sketch paper.  I'll always own one of these until I'm pushing up daisies. They're just worth
it."
kristi.mcc,"January 11, 2012","I absolutely love this pen. I've been using it for years and years and it's
always served me well. It springs back well, and takes all my abuse. It's worth
it- it will be a very faithful companion."
akoszis,"June 25, 2016","I specifically went looking for a pocket brush pen that could fit inside my
smaller watercolor materials case. I usually prefer the pentel pigment ink brush
pen, for its deep black and absolute waterproof-ness, but it's much too long to
fit in there. So I went looking and found this. The images and even other reviews said it was waterproof. It's not. Even leaving
it to dry for a good half hour still resulted in it developing pretty much a
dark grey wash effect when quickly gone over with a water brush. I tried all my
different papers in a full on gauntlet of trials, ""maybe it was just my first
paper not working well with it"", I thought. But same thing, none of them
resulted in the crisp whiteness shown in the example picture. The entire reason I bought this was for it supposively working with water, so
now with that option out I've got one extra pen I will need to find some other
use for. "
Yoyochanny,"January 23, 2013","Excellent!  Has a very black ink, not washed-out or grey. The brush is springy
yet soft enough to be bent down into a fan of bristles on the page if you so
desire.  Has a wet flow when moving slowly, and a charismatic, dry-bristle look
if you go faster than the ink has time to refill the tip.  Easy to refill as
well.  I recommend storing this pen on its side - it can leak into the cap if
stored brush-down, and will take time to start if stored brush-up."
nekoqueenbastet,"June 6, 2013","I used a Pentel pocket brush pen to ink my comics for years and years. My brush
finally frayed after 2 years of heavy use (about 120 pages of comics). I ordered
a replacement pen and to my dismay, it frayed within 6 pages! I figured I might
have gotten a bad batch, ordered a second and had the same problem. I bought a
third from Utrecht Art and ran into the same problem. It's unfortunate that the quality has declined, as this was my go-to pen for a
long time. Now I'm on a hunt for another brush pen. If you get a good one,
though - oh man is this pen amazing. "
depno8,"February 8, 2018","There's a reason so many rave about this brush pen.  Inexpensive with
replaceable cartridges, it does a fine job in various applications one use's a
brush pen for, with a tip that's very responsive in line sizing.  Nice deep
black too.  Nice balance and very light in hand."
foxinthestars,"June 29, 2010","This pen is absolutely wonderful! A sythetic hair brush tip with good spring, it
gives graceful, dramatic line variation from tiny hair strokes to bold
flourishes. I've never had problems with the ink overflowing or drying out; I've
even left the pen unused for weeks at a time and it's still ready to go the
instant I pick it up again. All this, and the ink, a nice rich black, is
waterproof. I still want to explore other brush pens too, but this is my
favorite drawing tool."
brushpenaholic,"January 4, 2018","Oh yes, my first brush pen. I used this pen EXCLUSIVELY for lineart for SIX
MONTHS. It started me on my magical brush pen journey and it made lineart my
favorite process in the artwork when before I HATED it. It's the prettiest most
slick pen in my collection with a sturdy body and is a true workhorse of a pen.
I can get a lot of line variety out of it and the ink looks beautiful black.
Work slowly though, or you'll get dry brush effects (not what I'm into). I think
every artist should try this pen at least once and that if you owned only one
brush pen in your art kit, this should be the one (this one or the Kuretake
Fountain no.8). Waterproof and marker proof too. The lines I get from this pen
are on the thicker side, so if you need a thinner version go with the Kuretake.
Downside is the refills are expensive for me. I highly recommend this one."
leebcgfx,"December 16, 2014","Have used one of these for the last 4 plus years. I love this thing. If you've never used one, it may be a pain. You will need to learn a new way to
hold it.Grip it very low with thumb and index finger, and curl your middle finger under.
Let the middle finger glide on the paper.There's other minor adjustments to the above for when you want to flick rat
tails and so on, but I think you have the idea."
aoutorihan,"July 14, 2014","This is one of the most wonderful (and waterproof!) brush pens I have come
across.  The ink comes out sleek and precise, and beautifully black. You can both draw
the finest of lines as well as nice, medium~thick ones. I would say this one
works a little better for kanji than for western writing, at least when writing
cursive, it can be a little tricky to write accurately. The colour is very rich
and thorough, but probably works best on smooth paper. When writing on thick,
rough paper (say, for water colour works), the ink will be sucked up a little
bit around the edges, so it won't be as crisp anymore. I also use the Pentel Standard Brush Pen (tsumi tip:
http://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Standard-Brush-Pen-Tsumi-Tip/pd/2416). Both are
very similar, but here's for some minor differences: The Standard seems a tiny
bit blacker. When writing calligraphy, the font gets a little wilder feeling to
it, and it can also give you the effect of a drying brush (small white spots)
around the edges of your writing, something the Pocket Brush rarely does.  However, and this might be important to some of you: I found the Pocket Brush
Pen to be ABSOLUTELY waterproof, while the Standard Brush Pen smudged even after
minutes of having it let dry."
suncityphoto,"August 15, 2013","The tip is very very soft. Very light pressure is all that is required. Good for
Asian characters calligraphic drawing. As I don't do that I'm wondering why I
got this. (:It makes great palm fronds and leaves. Ink is very black and waterproof..which
is great..so far that I've only tested it on cheap sketching paper and very
slight bleed which I expected. I'm pretty sure on bristol or watercolor paper it
will bleed less if any. Leaves a nice rough edge and long pointy line if used in the right manner. Seemed a little pricey compared to pilot and other versions but I generally like
Pentel stuff so I went for it and many strong reviews of this pen. If Asian influenced calligraphic drawing is your thing I believe this is an
excellent tool. May also be good for filling in wide patches of black in pen &
ink. The black ink cartridges are really black..compared to dr ph martins matte
black which is great. "
shadow_gal67,"March 25, 2012","This pen does great when I'm filling areas that need to be inked, especially the
larger ones and a few effects. I got Micron and Faber Castell brush pens, but
after using them for a bit, they start to leave clumps behind, so I only use
them for emergencies and small areas. I recommend this for anyone who draws!"
patricia.brooks,"July 8, 2011","This pen is awesome. I've tried some ""brush pens""- that is, felt-tipped pens
trying to be brush-shaped- before, and they just don't compare. The range of
line width that one can get with this pen is amazing, from hairline thin to big,
wet lines. I find that if I try to do long, fast strokes, I get some skipping,
but then again, that's not really a problem for me since I tend not to draw in
long strokes and was only doing that to test the pen out. Others might be a
little disappointed with that, though. That's the only con this pen has; the tip
is incredibly responsive, the ink is nice and dark, and the variation in line
width is wonderful. That, and it's kind of cool to watch the ink seep into the brush when you put in
the first ink cartridge :D"
danielbelchi,"May 9, 2009","El Brush Pen este de Pentel es la caña, sinceramente. No se parece en nada a cualquier otro ""rotulador con punta de pincel"" que hayas
podido probar, como los Pitt Artist Pen de Faber-Castell, ya que verdaderamente
tiene un pincel por punta. Esto permite trazos realmente finos, seguidos de
otros muuuy gruesos, como gustes. Es cómodo y fácil de manejar, también. La únicas pegas que le pondría son la intensidad del negro con que dibuja, que
dista mucho de la fabulosa tinta china de Winsor & Newton (también son cosas
diferentes), y la no resistencia al agua."
otacon451,"February 7, 2008","After having owned the Sakura brush pen and Faber-Castell Pitt artist penn for
several years, I can easily say that the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen is far superior
to both. A felt tip brush pen just doesn't compare to the level of control and
detail thats possible with this pen. This pen is flexible because actual
bristles, unlike felt, can effortlessly vary from a literal hairline to the
broadest stroke. Its in a league of its own really. The pitt pen is worthwhile,
although less versatile. It is certainly an adequate trainer pen, if you need
something to practice your technique. The sakura pen was somewhat crude in
comparison to both. This pen, if it can be found, and if you can use it, is
surely worth the price."
Camilla,"January 29, 2021","It's convenient and flows well, but I'd much prefer a thinner brush, which if
you're like me, I'd just get the standard brush pen extra fine.I ended up just using this for filling in blacks or doodling. It was good enough
for me to give a second try with the other pen so I mean it's worth the
experiment."
Cres CattyFae,"December 18, 2019","as others have said, this is a good penit can serve as an excellent workhorse since it keeps going reliably for a long
timeI currently possess two of these, one that I use more often that has the gilded
print deteriorating- I fill this one with black sumi-e ink and use with some
water, and another which is more pristine that I only use the associated
cartridges withI like these since they have a good design, work well, and are fairly
inexpensive- if you don't have one and want to try getting into brush inking,
this is one of my top recommendations, even better that you can refill this
too!~"
matt.pilla,"May 11, 2019","Fantastic!  I love this thing.  I've only used it a few times now for inking
some sketches.  It's a bit slower for smooth linework compared to using a brush
and ink, but not having to keep dipping/blotting makes up that time difference
for me.  You also gain the ability to create a dry brush look with quick
strokes, which is nice. The ink is dark and waterproofness is great (just make
sure you give it time to dry 1st).  Really no complaints here. "
ssjgexjmbr,"November 1, 2018","Just got this pen yesterday, and I love the interesting dry brush effects I can
get with it! I use it for doodling, and it has an insane line variety, which I
love. The bristles spring back even if I wrote down HARD with it. Amazing pen"
halorecoil,"January 16, 2018",The brush split into two after a few uses. Really disappointing
Raven,"September 21, 2017","Very fun to write with. Started practicing hiragana recently. Changes easily

Jenniferblackrave,"September 7, 2017"," It's  in is very opaque, the darkest out of all my pens.The brush tip took me

all wonderful."
Empressionzoo,"August 24, 2017","I'm tearing my hair roots out because I cannot find my refills! I love this pen
so much for Chinese calligraphy and sketch. Waterproof, beautiful. The ink holds
really well and doesn't dry out that easily (hence why I totally forgot where my
refills are...) The nib might take a while to get used to for beginners, but the
elasticity helps so new brush-pen users don't have to constantly reshape it.
Great for ultra thin and thick lines once you get the hang of it! "
TeraStarArt,"July 28, 2017","I love this brush pen. The brush tip gives you the ability to produce extra fine
and extra bold lines. I feel like I'm pretty hard on my brush pens but the
bristles have held up nicely. The pen comes with two refills and once the
cartridges are empty you can refill them with fountain pen ink and a syringe.
I'm planning on buying more so I can have multiple colors to choose from."
djkhimtaka,"July 2, 2014","The only thing keeping me from giving this pen a full five stars is the length
of the bristles. They just make it a bit hard to control this pen's line
sometimes. I'm used to a much shorter brush tip, I suppose. But the line widths
range from super, super fine to extremely wide! The long, soft fibers are more
suited to expressive strokes than controlled ones. The ink is probably the most waterproof ink of the all the brush pens I've ever
used. Once dry, it will. not. budge. So if you have a very practiced hand, you
could use this pen to permanently ink over your sketches. Of course, you can
always refill the cartridges with your own ink. I plan to use Noodler's Heart of
Darkness when the cartridge this guy came with runs out. Despite it being waterproof, you can get some interesting effects on paper that
has been pre-wetted. The sketches I made came out rather ghostly, or haunting.
It's pretty neat. In all honesty, I prefer my Kuretake brush pens, but this one's really nice as
well. The margin between them is very minimal.. I'm glad I went ahead and bought
this one. :3 Though I'll more likely use it for calligraphy purposes than art
purposes, as I was hoping to do originally."
NenonaFirestarDragonstrgteg1,"August 18, 2010","I won this in a contest a while back, and I do love it for making varied thick
and thin, smooth lines--the ink cartridge lasts quite a while, I'm still on the
first one!The brush is the perfect size, not too thin, not too thick, and the fact that
you can cap it up and use it to draw anywhere doesn't hurt either!"
plwinthrop,"May 5, 2010","If you want something for calligraphy this is the pen you should get. This is most likely the best pocket sized brush pen on the the market. Great
brush tip, sturdy construction and refillable huge cartridges.  This is part of where I knocked off one star, you have to use cartridges, their
is no converter to allow you to use other inks. This is mostly a environmental
concern because the Pentel ink cartridge is huge, it is about 80% the length of
the barrel."
chung123,"February 28, 2009","The Pentel Pocket Brush is just extraordinary.  The quality of the line that is attainable with this instrument is just
amazing! It's like an old friend--without the worries about knocking over a bottle of
Higgin's India Ink. You can work rapidly, without having to constantly dip into the bottle. JetPens sent this out really quickly. Thanks for such a great product!"
Moop,"December 20, 2022","I bought the jet pens Brush Pen sampler this year, probably one of the best
purchases I've made here, as I was introduced to some beautiful pens. Ofc one
develops favorites, and this was one of mine. That long brush tip, feels like
real natural hair and creates engaging and varied lines. Each word and every
drawing has life breathed into it. The are living things on my page. If you've
fallen in love with this pen, grab up the refills, so you don't have to wait in
between to use it. I got this one for my husband who likes to sign only using
this pen, so he needed his separate one. :P"
jtanderson,"November 2, 2022","bought on a whim to try it out. Even though I don't use brushes, I found it easy

satisfying"
josueguti1028,"October 3, 2022","Awesome pen, I thought it would be easy to control but it is very fragile when

imacaman,"September 19, 2022",Fun customized writing and drawing
bocaj.sskeyboardist,"August 5, 2022","As a preface, I am by no means a good brush calligrapher. But picking up this
pen and brushing down ink onto the page is a revelation. You can write quickly,
with extraordinarily broad lines and the little white spaces and slight splatter
that come from the separation of the bristles; you can write slowly and
carefully and get an incredible line variation and smoothness. The black ink is
utterly opaque and has almost a mystical presence on the page; it feels as
though the letters are more real than I am. Not for writing small though"

lexia velika,"April 11, 2022","Amazing pen! I'd been eyeing this one for a while before I finally took the
plunge. It took a really long time to get the ink to flow into the brush tip
after initially opening the pen and the second time I tried to use it hours
after getting the ink to flow enough for my initial test it took several minutes
to work properly. No issues since. Other ink is a deep true black and I love the
line thickness variety you can achieve with this pen. It does take some practice
though!"

xenon,"March 21, 2022","Really, really good brush pen. The bristles are more sensitive than an actual
brush. Loses a star because it takes a while to dry and runs out of ink pretty
fast, even with the two cartridges it comes with."
zhen_teng,"March 15, 2022","Feels the tip is too ""sharp"". But overall it is a very good choice."
billynickey,"February 15, 2022","Really, the brush is a bit soft, and the pen body and clip will never win any
awards, but the ink is just so good. Seriously, can I buy this black ink in a
bottle? So opaque with a velvet sheen and ridiculous coverage. The soft brush also carries a seemingly endless charge and the ink just flows
while you lay out a passage. As an added bonus, the ink dries quickly (this is
relative) and is quite water resistant after. I hate being tied to cartridges
but it is worth it to use such nice ink in a pocketable pen. Using bristle brush pens will always be a compromise but the incredible flow of
wonderfully black ink from this pen will always be an enjoyable experience.
Sketching, value studies, contour drawing, cartooning, calligraphy, this is the
brush pen to get.Now about getting me this ink in a bottle?  "

it. "

lettering, and just plain doodling when I’m stuck on the phone.  My only complaint is - and I’ve sort of ‘Frankensteined’ most of mine by
screwing the nib section into some metal bodied fountain pens I don’t always
use (the now defunct Delta Mini Trend) - I like having a heavier feel to my
pens.  I really wish Pentel, or JetPens, or someone would create a heavy body to
balance these a bit more - that’s just my own personal hand, although, I’m
sure others might feel the same.  In short - buy a few - and when you get empty cartridges fill them with
different colors! "

WierengaJoe,"October 20, 2020","This is a good option to get you into brush pens with fiber tips, but you
outgrow it pretty quickly. There's no way to control how much or how fast the ink flows to the tip, so if
you're drawing for a long time the brush will dry out and you just have to wait
for the ink to return. For the price it's really high quality, I think that's why it's so popular. Once
you get the hang of using a brush pen, I think you'll prefer the Pentel Pigment
Brush or the Kuretake #13, which is basically the same thing but with better ink
flow. "

last a long time."

ollivergrey,"March 19, 2017","I had been looking for a brush pen to use for most big and small lines, i
ordered this and loved how rich the color is, it has great elasticity in the
bristles on the tip, and always comes back into place even after the most angled
lines, its definitely a good idea to buy extra refill cartridges for this pen
cause you'll use up your two that come with the pen real quick! "
Nelsoart,"March 2, 2017","Slightly cheaper than the English version and just as good! gives a good line
and is a great tool to use for line variation that is more expressive. "
NovelTea,"February 28, 2017","I love this brush. It is definitely a wet pen -- the ink flows very smooth and
quickly from the brush tip. You can achieve hairline strokes, but that precision
mostly comes if you are only using the tip, i.e., it's pretty hard to transition
from hairline into a thicker width in one stroke. That said, you can still
achieve amazing thin-to-thick lines. It definitely excels if you are working
fast and loose, and gives you a tool to master linework with.Additional pluses -- fairly inexpensive, refillable, sturdy plastic body, can
achieve an extremely broad stroke, and the ink is waterproof if you're looking
to do watercolor over it.So good after my niece ""borrowed"" it, I immediately had to buy a new one two
days later."
vince.alvendia,"February 21, 2017","I wonderful and precise brush pen, especially for fine line work."
Declan,"February 20, 2017","One of the best brush pens I've used, and heavily recommend it to intermediate
to advanced brush users. However, beware, the ink went out pretty fast (or maybe I used it a lot!)."
justacreativerperson,"February 7, 2017","I really love this pen. The line variations and textures able to be created from
the brush is fantastic. You can create so many effects that a standard pen could
not. My only thing is that one of the fibers on my brush is longer than should
be and on careful detail work I have to watch out for it. Other than that, it's
great. If you have the right paper the ink is very a nice and solid black too.
Pretty comfortable to hold, and if you're not used to brush pens, take some time
to get accustomed to it and learn control, it'll be hard at the start which may
discourage you. Don't let it. "
Ram Diaz,"February 2, 2017","Awesome brush pen, you do have to wait a few minutes if you will use watercolor
over the ink for it to be waterproof.  This is what a brush pen should be!"
Theo,"December 4, 2016","LOVELOVELOVE. IT DRIES SO WELL AND SOLID. It isn't a jet black color but that's
not an issue for me. I haven't had a single fraying issue. It's got a lot of
flex to it since it uses synthetic hairs, letting me manipulate the brush more."
pham.5.tam,"November 30, 2016","I can use this for an entire page inking because it can cover from hair-breadth
to finger-broad lines. If the cartridge is removed, the lines can become much
thinner. When the ink is almost gone, I can also use it for dry brush effect.
This is why I bought another one so I can use both full & empty brush pen
without worrying about keeping the opened cartridge outside too long. (I am
probably too lazy to clean a brush. This pen probably does not need cleaning.)"
lizstevensart,"November 23, 2016",My absolute fav to draw with. Love this pen! 
ncwitowski,"September 28, 2016","Looooove! These long, bristley pens are my favorite! I have a few of them and
this is going to be my go-to pen for very thin to dramatically thick lettering.
It flows super smooth, with just enough ink- not too wet and not too dry. The
size is perfect for those that need something of substance to hold onto. The
body is smooth and looks plain but neat. I really like this pen. "
MiBe,"September 25, 2016","Awesome pen but the only downside for me is the length of the bristles. It
somewhat makes it harder to control and doesn't leave room for quick,clean
strokes. Aside from that, this is as good as it can get with pocket brushes."
Kussou,"August 24, 2016","Pretty good ink flow, nice super black ink. "
Amarnaphiliac,"June 30, 2016","I LOVE the ink in this pen. It looks professional and crisp and puts my micron's
to shame with ink quality.My only complaint, and it may be because I'm heavy
handed, is for the precision of the bristles when doing thin lines, they don't
spring back to form as much as I'd like. If I could get this pen in a narrower
brush size as well I'd be ecstatic, because I only notice it on smaller areas."
danlbell,"June 21, 2016","The Pentel Pocket Brush pen is like having a little bit of traditional Japan in
your pocket. The ink flows into the responsive bristles nicely. The line is
lively, ranging from a hair's breadth to a wide swath. Useful for Japanese or
brush calligraphy or brush drawing."
littleorangepig,"May 12, 2016","It's so nice! I love how it's dummy proof, like even a complete beginner like me
figured out how to set it up, as there was an arrow on the cartridge to even
tell you which way it went in, and literally within seconds, the brush got ink
and I played with it. My father who used mao bi in China used it and he created
such lovely chinese calligraphy from it. I love it. "
cinnammint,"April 19, 2016","this brush is amazing!! The ink is very fluid and consistant, and the tip stays
super sharp. the only downfall is that it uses ink quickly so be sure to buy a
few refills to keep handy!"
geraldbenton1,"March 15, 2016","First off ,I need to thank Jet Pens  for the speedy delivery. This is my second
pocket brush pen after the original became old and frayed.  They last a long
time , I  had my first one for four or five years. I love the quality and
variations of brushstrokes  you can do with it.  Ink refills can be expensive, 
but can found on here for a good price and higher quantity."
PaperNutEsq,"February 19, 2016","Believe the hype!  This brush pen is definitely one of the best I've tried.  It
handles and writes like it's worth triple its price.  I'm using this for
lettering and for signing my artwork.  The ink goes onto paper fully loaded and
the brush hairs never splay wildly or separate, even when applying moderate
pressure.  I love how it writes on Bristol vellum.  In fact, the smoother the
paper, the better the lines you can get from this brush pen.  If you're serious
about calligraphy then give this brush pen a try.  "
olivianatale25,"February 4, 2016","After reading numerous reviews of different brush pen brands, I finally decided
on the Pentel pocket brush. This was my first time using a brush pen, so I was
very excited to try it out! It writes beautifully and has a nice steady ink
flow. However, I was surprised that the first ink cartridge ran out after only 2
weeks of use! Maybe it was because I was so excited to use it that I practiced a
lot, but it still seems odd that it would run out so quickly... Otherwise, a
great buy!"

Yuli,"January 7, 2016","Literally the best brush pen you will find everI use it for drawing and dear god this brush pen is just xsdrftgyhujhgfdertythe only reason that i gave this a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is just because I go
through the ink replacements in a snap and they only give u two replacements
with the pen and the pen itself does not come with one inside but I guess I can
understand thatalso you have to use this pen moderately slow because if you make a line quickly
it'll do a patchy thing but its all gud"
Roy M,"November 12, 2015","This is brush pen is my favorite possession, other than maybe my house.  It
reinvigorated my interest in drawing.  It's so inviting and easy to use.  The
ink is superbly consistent and smooth.  And line width variation just makes
things, all things, look cool."

it is wonderful."
Jamie,"November 9, 2015","Very, very smooth, glides well. The brush is a little long and a little harder
for me to work with because of it, but that's more from my inability than any
issue with the pen."
rschoenrock07,"November 2, 2015","A very nice, flexible pen - the most paintbrush-like I've used yet. Definitely

and perfecting my caligraphy skills."
Crowsie,"October 12, 2015","I bought this pen in a brick and mortar store, but I just had to come here and
leave a review. This pen...is the business. I used to hate brush pens. This turned me into a
believer. Not only are these incredibly fun to use, but the ink is wonderful quality. Very
dark, both marker and waterproof. The brush size is perfect. I get fine lines
effortlessly and wider ones with just a bit more pressure. Also, the refills. The package comes with a couple, but you can buy a pack of 3
for an affordable price. Very much worth the initial investment. Recharging the
pack is as simple as pulling off the old one and plugging in the new. This is
great news, as I've always been afraid of pen converters and such. "
msan,"October 5, 2015","This has got to be one of the best, if not the top of the line, brush pens
available. I have had mine since 2008 and some of my best inked works have been
made with this pen...and it still holds a point! This is amazing and unheard of
in other brush pens...though I do like some of the other ones that Pentel offers
as well, for more ""sumi"" like effects. This one will take a beating and keep on
trucking...absolutely wonderful pen. I love the ink too, it's excellent and
marker and waterproof to boot. I have heard of people trying to fill these with
other ink, but why? The cartridges don't run out very quickly, unless you use it
on absorbent paper such as rice papers for Sumibokuga and Chinese painting.
Treat this with respect, and it will last you a life time. It even gives my WN
series 7 and Raphael sable brushes a run for their money...it's not a perfect
comparison, but wow does it come close!"
topfop81,"July 31, 2015","Really versatile and fun to use.  Ink flows nicely from the nylon fibers with no
unwanted drip."
M Murphy,"July 24, 2015","I hated this pen so much at first. It took forever for the ink to soak through
in to the brush, and when the brush finally turned black it was scratchy and dry
and awful and I nearly slam dunked it in the trash. But I paid more than $10 for
it so I kept it out of spite. Oh, Me. Weeks later I pulled it out to play with again, and I guess by then the ink had
finally fully soaked the brush. It's got a smooth clean stroke, not a hint of
drying out anymore. It's very close in quality to the Kuretake No. 13 brush pen,
albeit the ink isn't as dark. Really good if you don't want to deal with the
anxiety of throwing money down on a fancier pen only to mess up the bristles
*coughs*."
ninafish1,"June 29, 2015","I like the pen except for one feature:  the cap doesn't connect easily to the
rest of the pen.  It does write beautifully, but it would be a shame to lose that cap."
Roy M,"June 22, 2015","This little pen is one of my favorite things in the world.  Inexpensive,
versatile, robust, and fun.  I can do teeny tiny little lines, or big swooshy
strokes, all the live long day.  This is the thing that made me realize I like
brush pens."
hansleon417,"June 18, 2015",Great tool for inking and filling in large areas of black for your drawings. 
treemerryweather,"May 28, 2015","LOVE this pen  - it's a brush black black ink and is refillable. There is lots
of flex in the brush so I can vary the width of the strokes. The pen came with
two cartridges and I also purchased the Pentel pack of four refill cartridges.
I've been playing with this toy consistently for three weeks and I have barely
made a dent in the original cartridge. Cannot recommend this highly enough."
Readyray1979,"May 27, 2015","Awesome pentel pocket brush pen for calligraphy  im a life long customer thank
you "
liralenli,"May 27, 2015","Flexible, bouncy brush that works as a real brush should for Chinese calligraphy
and my painting. I really adore this, now that I've finally gotten it and can
compare it to the other brush pens. The real fibers in this make a huge
difference, and it's not felt. The ability to push back and make real bone marks
for calligraphy is wonderful and the ink is dense and thick enough to do the
kind of coverage I want and still slow enough to leave flying white when I want
to."
momlovesbaby,"May 26, 2015","A nice light weight brush pen for calligraphy and sketching.  You can get more
ink but drawing normal speed, a little qiuck strokes will get a dry effect.  If
handled well it can get nice line variations depending on your writing mood. 
It's great that it's refillable, you can use any color bottled ink as well with
a syringe and carefully filling the cartridge."
crobertsdesign,"May 19, 2015","This is my new favorite drawing pen! I love the variable thickness line and
flow!"
elacartier,"May 5, 2015","I'm not good at using this pen to anything like full power yet. I tend to use
pencils more for drawing than brushes, so my brush skills are weak. But compared
to pretty much any other brush type thing I've used... this is better. The tip
springs back into shape. It responds to every little twitch I make. Mostly, I
didn't mean to make them, but it shows me what I'm actually doing, not what I
think I'm doing. It's great fun for drawing, especially if you're doing any kind
of speed drills like the fast poses in a life drawing class. Very responsive,
and it is easier to work with fast bold strokes with this than slow deliberate
ones. It's very rewarding to see the improvement over even a short class
session.I'm gradually learning to get it to work for bits of Roman alphabet calligraphy.
Nothing that looks good yet, just hammering at basic letterforms and making the
brush do what I want. Lots of thinking about the shapes the brush makes easily
and how to fit that with letters.I haven't gotten through an ink cartridge yet, tho I've killed about a 70 page
notebook mostly sketching with this. It seems like the cartridges last a good
long time."
said00,"April 20, 2015","Lovely brush pen, a lot of different lines quality. Great."
DiazArtist,"April 13, 2015","I think this pen is awesome and probably the best one out there. The reason I
write an average review is because my first pen after it ran out of ink I
replaced with a refill and for some reason it started to rush out more ink than
I need. Nothing out of this world, but enough for the pen to feel like it's
bleeding as opposed to just able to write think to thick lines like it should.
It may have been an individual problem and perhaps I shook the pen to get the
ink down faster and it caused this problem. I'm not sure. So I purchased a new
one and will have to wait to see if it does that again. So far the first refill
was installed and the ink is running down the tip as it should. This time I just
let the pen sit at an incline for half an hour until the ink saturated the tip
then I started to use the pen until it went from dry brush to its typical needle
to thick strokes."
judynovak,"March 19, 2015",Five stars for this pen....absolutely love it. 
tara,"March 13, 2015","LOVE this pen. The brush is quite soft, and full of ink, so it just writes
effortlessly.  It was a bit expensive, but it works great, and I like that it's
refillable, so it's all good.  Very satisfying to write with for some reason :)"
visionaryartsnj,"March 10, 2015","Pen is awesome and the delivery  was faster then expected. Everything came safe
and sound. "
Bernadette,"February 23, 2015","Love this pen. Great for lettering. I've used some brush pens that will flick
out if you try to apply backward pressure. This one won't do that. Just glides
around smoothly. Love it."
Howard Tayler,"February 11, 2015","GET THIS ONE. If this is your first foray into brush pens, start here. It's got
an actual bristle brush that performs brilliantly. It keeps its point well, the
ink flows freely, and if you want to make broad, splayed-brush strokes the fill
will be solid. There are cheaper ""starter"" pens, but you may end up frustrated,
and might never come back to brushes. The barrel itself is a solid, no-nonsense sort of thing that allows you to feel
through it to the touch of the brush on the paper -- a tactile experience that
is almost as delightful as making art itself. I've refilled mine three times now, and it's a simple, no-mess operation. I'm
considering buying a second one so that one can live on my desk, and the other
in my travel case. Forgetting to pack this one with me is a disaster -- it has
become that intrinsic to my process."
The D,"December 29, 2014","Awesome Pen i use mine to fill in black spaces in my drawing however when i

I think you might have to clean the tip but overall good pen"
pbpartido,"December 18, 2014","Absoultely awesome, 4 refills and counting."
nami,"December 14, 2014","This has a snappy tip and is still going strong after three years.  There has
been no deterioration in line quality, as it is still making hairline strokes. 
The ink is mostly waterproof as long as you're not flooding the paper with
water.  Very good for controlled inking of pencil underdrawings.  However, I
don't feel as inclined to just doodle with it like I do with other, less precise
brush pens."
Blackhorse,"December 5, 2014","Stunning results. Easy to use. Me and every other sentient creature that tries
it, loves it."
msan,"November 29, 2014","Hands down this is the best pocket brush pen, period. It's excellent for getting
a very fine to a broad stroke, handy for travel or in the studio, and the ink is
a nice mat black. Use this in combo with the Sailor fountain pen, and you have a
nice on the go inking sketch kit that fit's in your pocket!"
bbobjjoe,"November 8, 2014","I love this pen, arrived quickly 100% satisfied"
gnomeskulblaka,"October 16, 2014","I've never used a pen brush before, but this one is super easy to use. I was
afraid it wouldn't put out enough ink when drawing, but that was not the case.
Gushes just the right amount of ink to give you a super fat line or just enough
to give you a super thin line. Great for varying line weights."
Maria,"October 11, 2014","This was my first brush pen, and honestly, I'm not sure how good a call that
was. The brush is an actual brush- bristles and all, but that makes it rather
difficult for a beginner to use properly. Though, once you get used to it...
DAMN, it's just not possible to put down! When you get the hang of it, the
pressure games begin, and the pen is delightful, with a magnificent variety of
line widths, from as thin as a hair (and even thinner) to a 9mm black line.
Wonderful!The ink does bleed slightly on some types of paper, but the bleeds aren't major
and are easy to fix. Love this pen! "
John Verone,"October 11, 2014","After hearing how so much people loved this pen I decided to buy it and give it
a try. It was fun to use for the first few minutes, but then I realized I
couldn't make really thin lines after about five minutes, after a while longer
the ink would begin to flow too much and take forever to dry with the excess
ink. And lastly, not even a week in, the pen started dripping on my paper. A pen
is of no no use if it can potentially ruin your artwork just by waiting 30
seconds and it drips.The only good this pen is to me is if I'd wish to fill a very large area with
black or I draw with the brush pointed upward which is awkward and inaccurate.
No one has mentioned this issue exempt one from what I've seen but I don't like
how I can't find what reason it would do this or to stop it. "
Lapicerista,"April 28, 2013","Excellent pocket style brush pen, looks and feels like another pen. Easy to
produce different strokes and ideal to practice calligraphy in other languages. "

Valentine,"November 9, 2012","This pen, with some practice, has become my absolute favorite to ink an image
with. I don't know what I'd do without it honestly! The range of line width is
incredible. It requires a confident hand however if you're doing super thin
varied lines. Completely in love with this pen. "
costakout,"February 22, 2012","The perfect cartooning tool. Great for inking lines, slight and thin touch-ups,
and large fill-ins of solid black. "
austinkw,"August 6, 2010","When I opened the pack and first saw the brush tip I was a little skeptical.
however, after using this pen for a few days to practice writing Kanji,
Katakana, and Hiragana, I was surprised by the quality of the brush tip and the
ink. The flow of the ink is very smooth and is smear proof within a second or
two. It is truly one of the most enjoyable writing instruments I have ever used.
I am still on the first ink cartridge so I can't speak to the longevity but so
far I am very happy with this pen."
April.hurtado,"August 1, 2010","I love this pen.It's good to have since I can't carry a brush, ink and water with me all over.
It's waterproof, so great for watercolor washes. I like how it looks pretty
classy, so I'm not ashamed to bring it out and goof off, and I also liked how
the sturdy barrel can't be squeeze, so no scare of squishing the ink out. And my brother who studies japanese loved it too, I ordered him one and he likes
to show off the beautiful lines he gets for his calligraphy."
info,"March 23, 2010","A fantastic pen. Have a Kaimei and a Kuretake, this simply out performs them in
quality and price...and ease of use. Cartridges are refillable, do not believe
what ya read on the net. When I bought mine a few years ago from Jet, it came
with water soluble ink, not sure if they do now. Only thing to be careful of is
the ""weight""of the ink you use. Too thin = greys not blacks, too heavy and you
loose the sharp tip. Jet also has the best price for them and the ship was quick to here in the
Midwest."
drusadventures,"March 6, 2010","I love to draw. Mostly with pencil and occationaly with a micron pen. I was
looking to try something completly different. I wanted something with more
variety in its stroke. I thought about a brush and paint or ink. However, I am a
clutz and would undoubtedly make to much of a mess. Plus i really hate cleaning
up. I have used fountain pens but this still did not produce the free flowing
feeling i wanted. This pen is insanely awesome!! it fit the bill perfectly. I do not usually
write reviews but I have enjoyed using this pens so much that felt I had to
share. After 5 months of use so far no mess. By experimenting i have been able
to produce a variety of strokes. When drawing I can apply a light prsesure to
produce small details and added pressure and more of an angle to create
increased coverage to fill in an area. I know it says for calligraphy but give
it a try. I still use the old pencil and micron pens but this pen has earned a
place beside them. Now if only i could find a decent pencil case i could be
happy with Ive tried 6 so far and they all have their issues."
April.hurtado,"January 21, 2010","I bought this because I'm a artist and I like to get my hand on all sorts of
tools.I've always sorta of liked painting with ink and a brush, but sometimes the
hassle of getting out the tools made it troublesome, and I could never do it on
the run.I got this particulallar pen because it looked, nice, simple, and was
waterproof, considering I have a tendency to add watercolor to my sketches. It's so much fun to draw with and it's handy and I take it absolutely
everywhere, should inspiration suddenly hit. I'm eager just bringing it out.My brother takes Japanese and when he borrowed the pen, he loved it for the bold
look it gave and he really liked that the ink dried fast enough to keep from
making messes. I'm ording him one now. Overall, we both recomend it."
rlrubenking,"November 6, 2009","Plenty of reviews here already. Let me just say ""I agree."" This is a terrific

natebeaty,"August 11, 2009","by far my favorite drawing instrument, and one i've used almost daily for over
five years. fantastic for extremely fine lines, beautiful thick lines, scratchy
shading, and everything in-between. these aren't terribly easy to find.. i
really hope jetpens gets them back in stock soon."
transient.nature,"January 24, 2009","I decided to pick one of these up, after trying the other Pentel brush pens. I
really love it! The ink flows well, and you can easily get multiple line
variations. It's also a very convenient and portable size. It's also great that
the ink is waterproof.  I think like any of the nylon brush style pens, if you are not as experienced
with painting or inking, it might take a bit to get accustomed to. You won't get
the same type of control as with a felt based brush pen.  I think this is a great quality pen like the other Pentel brush pens so I would
recommend it."
thedanabbott,"December 12, 2008","I love this pen! It arrived less than a week after I ordered it (USA to Germany,
5 days) and I've already gotten a lot of use out of it. Much more flexible
brush-tip than i'm used to, but easy to get accustomed to, and it seems to
magically retain its sharp and very fine point. Good for thick opaque lines or
hair-thin detail. Feels good in the hand too. I'm marrying this pen."
kyubikitsy,"December 3, 2008","For a true pocket brush pen, seriously - this is a wonderful product. It not
only comes with 2 cartridges (1 for use, 1 for refill), but the brush point is
truly a brush point with synthetic bristles! I would consider the point ""fine"", but depending on how heavy (or light) a hand
you use when inking/drawing, the line quality varies a lot. The point stays
sharp so all stroke starts are clean and pointed. The ink is pigment-based and waterproof, but I find it a little lighter/thinner
other ink pens. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this particular pen to someone just getting
started with inks and brushes with hopes of drawing. To get the type of line
you'd like would probably take a some practice and patience. For
Japanese/Chinese calligraphy, this would be an excellent pen for penmanship
practice as the point has a nice flexibility and drag when practicing
loose-handed strokes. As for water-proofing, this one holds up the best when dried and washed over
with a wet brush. There is very little smearing, if any - and little
deterioration of color."
Sheryl,"October 30, 2008","I have tried -- and fallen in love with -- many different brush pens, but I
really could have stopped with the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen. The nice,
lightweight plastic body is sturdy and well-balanced. The synthetic hair nib is
longer and more flexible than non-Pentel brush nibs I have tried, which first
meant less control but -- with practice -- means more range and variation. If
you are not the collector that I am and you want only one drawing brush pen,
then go with this one."
jehucampos,"August 16, 2008","The black Pentel Brush Pen had been my favorite tool for brush sketching on the
go until I found this item! Because it looks and feels just like any other pen,
this pocket brush pen is perfect for keeping in bags, travel artist satchels,
and even your pocket. Even though it has a smaller nylon bristle tip than it's
bulkier big brother, this pen delivers everything the Pentel Brush Pen could do,
and because the ink cartridge is located safely inside the barrel of the pen,
there is no danger of accidentally squeezing and spilling ink. Definitely a good
buy for a great price."

randoman_00,"March 2, 2014","i really do like this pen. it works in all the ways all the other revierws say,
just my one problem is that i wanted to change the ink and get something a bit
lighter in it for washes. i soaked my nib in water over night and everything,
but it isn't sucking up the new ink i put in. my nib was old but i bought a new
one so we'll see. it isn't the ink as i put it in the platinum refillable pen
and that one is soaking it up just fine."

Mister Twister,"May 11, 2017","This is the workhorse of the brush pen industry. However, it is no Ferrari.It is a model that guarantees you decent quality lines and waterproof ink, and
you are guaranteed to find it sold everywhere. But this pen is just not THAT
good. First, the tip is too long and bends too easily, meaning it is all too
easy to accidentally produce a thick line when you did not want to. Also, the
tip has a problem staying sharp from the first day of use (with stock ink, mind
you). Maybe it is the type of nylon used in production, maybe it is the way the
pen's body doesn't really keep the point sharp, relying on the sticky properties
of ink to do that.To summarize, it is hard to control your lines with this pen, very hard to keep
them thin. And that is a big issue. Sadly, it seems Pentel do not even want to
create a better pen model."

egneckow,"February 16, 2011","I always wondered about the shape of this pen–in photos, it looks awkward.
Hold it in your hand, though, and you'll discover the extremely
well-thought-out, svelte design that made me reconsider many pens I have loved
for years (and I'm stubborn!). My only complaint is that it becomes top-heavy
when the cap is posted, but it's a minor gripe considering the excellent writing
quality and a price that mortals can afford. Subtle details will come to light
the more you use it, and I'm considering getting a ballpoint too. Stop
wondering–you should own one of these!"
nelsonkatherine220,"September 9, 2011","I absolutely adore this pen. Holding it becomes so natural its like writing with

it a perfect match for my rhodia webbie. awesome awesome awesome!"
phoenix.kiss,"February 28, 2011","The pen so nice I bought it twice (I have this one and the white and chrome F
point). I love the triangular grip on this pen. I have large-ish hands -- for
perspective, I can stretch an octave and a key on a baby grand piano -- and I
find the Lamy exceptionally comfortable. It's lightweight, and I honestly don't
have too much of a problem with the cap when posted, though it is a bit of extra
weight. The nib is stiff and isn't the smoothest nib I've ever written with (that
distinction goes to my Namiki Vanishing Point), but it is exceptionally
consistent and I almost never get any scratching or feathering. I write on cheap
looseleaf paper most of the time, as I'm a student, and I honestly have no
complaints. It's well worth the price as it's almost completely indestructible
-- I use it for that reason alone much more than some of my other pens."
jfeltracco1,"February 28, 2011","This pen is wonderful, from the high-quality plastic to the super smooth nib,
this thing has blown me away completely. This is a must buy for anyone looking

from Jetpens was very fast and there were no issues at all. This was a great
first purchase and probably many more will ensue..."

I have smaller handwriting and i found the fine nib to be tooooo large.  Dont be
afraid to go extra fine ESPECIALLY IF YOU DONT WRITE IN CURSIVE AND YOU WRITE ON
COLLEGE RULED PAPER; you will find the flow and size to be too overwhelming and
you will get ugly looking writing.  I made this mistake and now i have to spend
10$ on a ef nib.  Also, some advice, if you do get a converter, waterman has the
best ink at a great price"

AngelusSolus,"February 2, 2022","As the JetPens slogan says, it was love at first write.  The nib is smooth

textured surface and ergonomic grip section.  One other thing I really love is
the cap posts securely, unlike the LAMY Joy, and balances the fore-end
perfectly.  I was hesitant to get it, but I'm glad I did.  I think I found my

However, the barrel's plastic worries me when I twist it open - it doesn't twist
as smoothly as I'd like and I'm worried that I might break it when refilling the
ink. Other than that, this is a great pen. I would recommend this pen to people
who prefer lighter pens without much weight to it. As it stands, I think I
prefer my pilot metropolitan despite it being slightly less wet. The weight of
the metropolitan's metal body works better for me. This is still a great pen
though! "

Anton von Grunberg,"May 18, 2020","This is a quality pen. The design and construction is wonderful for an everyday
carry pen. But, the nib came rather scratchy and did not have very smooth flow.
I ordered the fine nib because everything I had read led me to believe the
medium writes pretty broadly. However, the fine is just too scratchy. I am not
sure if that is the case with all Lamy fine nibs or just the specific product I
received. I initially used the included cartridge, then did a thorough cleaning
to use bottled ink through the Lamy Z 28 converter. Even after using bottled ink
through the converter, the nib still writes pretty scratchily. The print on the
nib that says the nib width and 'Lamy' is also double printed, sort of like a
hologram. I love the pen's feel in the hand and the durability, but so far I am
not overly ecstatic about the quality control of the nib. Maybe I will try an
AL-Star with a medium nib. "

Jokerful,"January 10, 2020","I was a bit nervous getting this pen despite all the good things I heard about
it because of mentions of it feeling cheap, too light, and the nib size being
larger than expected however I'm very happy with it. First, it's a good weight for me. I prefer lightweight pens and find that it's
not too light nor too heavy. If you have the Pilot Kakuno then it's a bit
heavier than that. The quality is also nice given how inexpensive it is.Second, people are right about the nib size which is actually why I got the fine
nib. I prefer a medium sized nib so this was perfectly fine for me. To compare
to the Kakuno again, the Safari fine nib is slightly larger than the Kakuno
medium. I will note that I heard overall negative things about the ink cartridge that
comes with the pen so I just decided to buy a converter right off the bat and
use bottled ink instead. I'm using Noodler's Heart of Darkness, not sure if
there are better inks to use with it but I have no complaints.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this pen."
akalexander24,"November 2, 2019","This was my first non-disposable fountain pen, and it's still my everyday
choice. I love the all-black look. Nib is smooth and doesn't catch while I'm
writing, I like the window that shows when I'm low on ink, and the ergonomic
grip is very pleasant to write with even for extended periods. I picked up this
Safari with the converter (found under ""Recommended Parts"") and a 30ml of
Diamine ink--a great introduction to finer writing instruments for only about
$40. "
sportypebbles,"August 13, 2013","The pen is wonderful- I actually also bought the same pen with Fine medium for
myself and this one for my boyfriend- but the nib is terrible. There is
something different about the silver nib (came on my yellow Safari) and the
black nib that comes with the Carcoal body pen. It drags too smoothly (or so it
feels) and doesnt let enough ink out, resulting in slow starts and skipping
while writing. Both the medium and fine nibs have this problem, so its not
exclusive to one pen, and the silver nib I have does not have this problem no
matter what ink I use. The Charcoal is a cool pen and it looks great, but the black nib is terrible."
lynn.be,"February 25, 2011","Great pen! It has a comfortable grip and none of the usual fountain pen

tr_whitney,"February 14, 2010","Great value! I have one with a medium nib which is great for writing, but the

thinner lines by rotating the pen nib 180 degrees."

not glossy), and the F nib is smooth. It's a finer line than the M of course,
and I like using them both in a document to have a little contrast of line
weight. Lamy's black ink is really good. I bought a bottle after using a Lamy black ink
cartridge, so that I could use it in other pens, such as Pilot's Kakuno and the
lower-end Platinum pens. "

shiny silver.It’s beginner friendly enough that I was able to replace the ink in the

part of my small ""starter bundle,"" which also included a Kaweco Liliput, and
Pilot Metropolitan. I've used each pen for a bit, now, and all three are quite
nice. Of the lot, though, I have to say that the Safari I appreciate the least,
thus far. Don't get me wrong -- it has it's merits, and writes nicely. I do like
the ergonomic finger rests, at times, but not necessarily all the time. For my
taste, the pen is a little too light -- for a full-sized pen, I think I prefer
the considerable heft of the Pilot Metro. All that said, I will definitely use
this pen from time to time, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, to
at least try. There isn't anything about it that makes it difficult or finicky
to use, that's for sure."

my nibs in the future to try other sizes. The converter has this nifty feature
where it locks into place, so I don't sweat the fact that the pen sometimes gets
bumped around in my jacket pocket. This pen is really at the sweet spot of
quality and price- it's not so expensive that you would hate to lose it (or so
fancy that you would be hesitant to just toss it in your pocket), but it is a
quality writing instrument. I look forward to trying out some of the Lamys that
are in the higher range, but this really gives me confidence that those will be
stellar writing instruments. The fine nib is pretty wet, which I like, but that
sometimes means that with thinner paper one can only use one side. I can foresee
this pen being my workhorse pen from here on out!"

looks, excellent flow. Overall a wonderful pen, even more so because of the
great price point. I considered a Safari for years, and I'm very glad I finally
bought one. Plus, the ability to easily change out nibs is wonderful, in case I
want to let the muse take me and write with a stub nib for a day or two!"
thegreatusername,"October 7, 2016","There aren't a lot of negative things one can say about this pen. It writes
incredibly smoothly, looks very professional, the ABS plastic body is incredibly
durable, it has a nice weight, and the cartridge-fed Lamy inks are pretty nice
as well (the blue-black ink is my personal favorite.) The Lamy Safari will
definitely be part of my everyday carry for a while."
1976,"July 6, 2016","This pen is amazing! I use this pen for sketching and drawing. Lightweight and
precise, the fine nib is a good size for details and if you need finer detail
you can use the back of the nib. It's like having two size nibs in one!! I would
recommend this pen to anyone who wants an easy to use/great design fountain pen
for art. "

marievanpelt,"May 31, 2016","I have SO MANY fountain pens spanning the last sixty years....most require some
'finesse' to write with them.  Thus it is GREAT to have a pen that writes
without being tricked into working :-)"

cantinadiva,"March 22, 2016","I adore this pen, this is my second Lamy (I have a ballpoint also). It writes
smooth and has also made me slow down my writing. Lines are crisp and ink
doesn't feather on a legal pad or a Rhodia. I plan on ordering the same pen in
Medium and Bold nibs. Very happy with this purchase."

construction. "
jenyarose,"February 20, 2016","It's not the weird triangular grip that did me in. It's the lip!! There's a
horrible lip at the bottom of this grip that you literally stub your finger into
every time you're writing. If you like to hold the pen with a low grip you will
not be happy with the lip. Had to return this, but I must say it was an absolutely buttery nib, perfect
flow and wonderful writing experience...except for the terrible finger stubbing
discomfort of the dreaded lip!"

one in  each colour "
Jatasgo,"February 9, 2016","I enjoy this pen a lot. It is really nice and ergonomic. The only issue I have
which is my own fault, was that I ordered the wrong size nib. For me I enjoy a
broader nib and the fine nib is really fine to me. Also, the ink is a little
sub-standard but it works well enough."
melinda.guebert,"January 14, 2016","Nice pen. The plastic mold grip takes a bit of getting used to. But for my first
fountain pen, I'll count it as a win."
Setter Rob,"January 10, 2016","A wonderful pen. It would be the best EDC I could imagine but for one issue: The
snap-on cap, after a lot of use, tends to become unreliable. I have had it come
off in at least three shirts and a pair of cargo shorts, only one item of which
could be salvaged. The company replaced my pen cap, twice, but I now carry this
pen in my messenger bag. For my pocket or shirt placket I have switched to a
little TWSBI with a crew-on cap."
eckored2369,"June 29, 2015","Money well spent on this pen.  I use it as my daily writing utensil and I get
complimented all the time and asked where I got it. I had a couple of Co workers
ordering from here because they loved the pen so much.  The only thing I should
have done differently is order more refills because I'm going through about a
cartridge a week. But that was me not thinking about it while ordering. The pen
is smooth and the ink dries fairly quickly and that's huge because I'm a lefty.
I recommend this pen and plan on ordering a few different colors and nib sizes
for my collection."
WildBill,"June 25, 2015",Great pen. Comfortable to hold. Writes smooth.
rmmlawyer,"June 13, 2015","I have the fine point and it writes smoothly on various papers.  I use it with
the optional Z24 converter that in my opinion should have been included with the
pen. I am using Pilot blue-black ink in the pen with no issues.  Ergonomics are
OK but sometimes I need to reposition my grip due to the flat spots and also I
need to be sure the cap is clipped with the spring clip away from hand.  The
all-black stealth color a nice cool factor along with the stiff wire pocket clip
that provides a secure attachment to my pocket.  The cap and body are plastic
making the pen feel very light and cheap in hand.  If this pen had a metal body
I would give it 5 stars. The ink level window is a nice touch but  not necessary
and detracts from the lines of the pen as do the flat areas the windows are
located in my opinion. The cap is round and the body has two flat areas."

Two Time an Anus,"November 4, 2014","Really nice. No problem getting the ink to flow that you might get with cheaper
fountain pens. I prefer the extra fine nib slightly to the fine nib for most
situations. But the fine nib is nice to have too."
aja1301,"March 6, 2013","All around wonderful pen.  The grip looks a bit odd at first but, it is actually
really comfortable to use.  I enjoy writing with this pen so much that I
completely emptied the cartridge that comes in it within the first day! For only
28 dollars.. you cannot go wrong with the Lamy Safari."
anjin_m,"October 17, 2012","While this pen worked very well for me for about a year it eventually started to
leak. Around the nib, at first I thought it was nib creep but upon further
inspection it appears there is a crack in the feed. I really like this pen
otherwise. It served me well in writing rapid-fire notes and I like it's shape
and it's feel in my hand, if I was sure it would not leak I would buy another in
an instant."
kowalcht,"September 15, 2012","I see people all the time talking about how great the other pens they have arebut that they use the Lamy all the time because its writes so well and is
inexpensiveso why bother with the more expensive ones? Well I have several of the other
brands$$$ and I use the LAmy more than any of the others. It doesn't dry out and
writesgreat I have no complants at all about it. If you are new to fountain pen and
are lookingfor a starter pen to see how you like it pick a Lamy."
maybe8675309,"September 4, 2012","This is the first fountain pen I've owned that cost over $16. My past experience
is with the Platinum Preppy and the Sailor Candy. This pen is a whole world of
awesome, especially when comparing it to the nasty Sailor Candy pen. I am using the Lamy Safari Fountain Pen with the fine nib, the converter, and
Waterman ink. The pen flits easily across the page whether I'm writing slowly or
quickly. The only time I've had skipping is when I was using it on a card
purchased at Papyrus - obviously it was the stock and not the pen. I probably
wrote twenty pages in my journal within 1.5 days of purchasing this pen because
I just wanted to keep experiencing it.  The pen looks like a $3 office pen. There is nothing that screams, ""Awesome
pen!"" when you look at it. I tried the one that looks just like this but has an
aluminum body, and that pen was far too heavy for me to be happy. If it needs to
be cheap looking in order to be an ideal writing instrument for me, so be it :-)
I just hope no one walks away from my desk with it when I use it at work. It has
a very similar appearance to one of the cheap brands they purchase for office
supplies."
stinkyFur,"August 25, 2012","LOVE this pen. It writes like ""Butta""!!  It's my Go-to pen for work and play. I

hrtharp,"May 19, 2012","I love this pen! This was my first Lamy and I fell in love with it. I used to have a very
expensive fountain pen that got stolen. I always wanted another but decided to
buy an economical one to start. Boy, am I glad I did! I've bought several more
fountain pens since this one and its still my everyday go to pen. (even over my
Lamy Al-star!) The shape of the pen was odd but once I held it and started writing, it fit like
a glove. Its very comfortable to hold for a long period of time without my hand
hurting, which happens quite a bit with smaller or too large pens.  Flow is even and doesn't skip. Everything from handmade Italian papers to
regular printing papers, it wrote like a dream. There is one cheap post it I
have that it doesn't agree with but it's most likely the ink, not the pen. Pen
writes beautifully without skips but ink on that post it is blotchy. Otherwise,
its a thing of beauty. I bought the fine nib and am perfectly happy with it but I need to purchase an
extra fine nib. I prefer my nibs small. If you're used to Asian pens, mainly
Japanese, this fine feels more like a medium. "
schiang68,"May 18, 2012","This pen is great-- very light, comfortable to hold, and lays down ink very
smoothly.  It's stylish in an understated way and feels tough enough to take
anywhere, which means that it'll get a lot more use than my possibly-too-pretty
Watermans.  Also, you get some nice flexibility from the fact that the nibs are
easy to change."
jvsgabriel,"April 7, 2012","I liked this pen a lot, it just looks cool, and being German, it works
flawlessly.  I have to say that form follows function in this pen.  I was a bit
dissapointed with the line thickness, as it writes a bit too thick for me.  I
was to later read that Japanese/Asian pens write more finely than European ones.
 So a European fine is more like a medium in the Asian pen standard.  Which
makes sense to me, cause if you are writing Chinese Characters, you will need a
very fine line indeed to write clearly with a fountain pen.  That being said,
the line quality was perfect, it never skipped and wrote more wet, but never
smudged.  I also loved the little window to see just how much ink was left in
the comverter.  All in all a very nice pen.  "

mariowolfe,"February 11, 2012","Hello fellow JetPens visitors, I've been using this fine nib'd Lamy Safari in charcoal black for about 4 years
with the converter from JetPens using only Noodler's Bulletproof Black ink which
I picked up here as well. This pen has been my go-to pen for improving my writing and for almost every
subject in college for these past 3-4 years. I highly recommend it to anyone who
likes fountain pens, as this pen never skips and never needs to be tempered in
order to get it going. All you need to do is remove the cap and the ink flows if
you have ink in it. Most reliable of all my fountain pens. I'm writing this review now because I have seen this pen in the new Liam Neeson
movie , The Grey, which is out in theaters now. I got excited and decided to get
on here and check out the inventory again.  Buy this pen... do it."
scotthintz,"January 19, 2012","This is my new favorite everyday carry pen. I routinely carry it in a shirt
pocket and have never had a problem with leakage. The built in window gives me
plenty of warning before I run out of ink so I am not caught without a working
pen.  Service at Jet Pens was great. No surprises. Prompt delivery. "
katie.dowdle,"January 13, 2012","So glad I ordered this pen! It is definitely the smoothest writing fountain pen
I've tried so far. Very comfortable to hold, but the design does look bulky even
in person. "
k95j01,"December 6, 2011","Out of the box, amazing. I was overwhelmed by how relatively better it was
compared to my cheaper pens. After a while, a couple of minor things started
happening. With my pen, I am using the converter with Rohrer and Klingner
Alt-Goldgrün and noticed the normal writing wasn't shading as well as I wanted,
but it was still smooth, so it wasn't a big deal. After a couple of days,
however, the flow was even better, the writing was even smoother, and I got a
hang of loading ink into the pen properly. Completely satisfied. Next stop,
webnotebook... :("
tanabebrad,"December 5, 2011","The Safari is a perfect introduction to the fountain pen world.  It is
inexpensive, easy to maintain, is built well, has good ergonomics, and flows
well with nearly any ink. I used the cartridge that came with the pen, but have switched to a converter
with Diamine Asa Blue.  The ink flows extremely well and is very enjoyable to
write with.  The triangular grip fits nearly any hand, but I personally prefer a
rounded grip.  You can post the cap on the pen, but I feel it makes the pen
quite top-heavy, so I use the Safari unposted. Much has already been said about this pen, but I feel the clip doesn't get
enough recognition.  This trademark clip is subtle but very practical, allowing
the pen to sit deep in the pocket while gripping the cloth reasonably well.  My
favorite aspect of the clip is that it curves upward towards the end, allowing
me to slip it quickly and easily into my pocket using only one hand!"
k95j01,"December 1, 2011","Absolutely night and day. Compared to my other pens, notably cheaper, pens
(Pilot Penmanship and Plumix, and Platinum Preppy) its absolutely perfect
comparatively. Smoother, nearly as fine, similar, but better, grip. I loaded it
with the converter. I had problems keeping the nib in the ink, but that is the
bottle, not the converter or pen. Loaded with Rohrer & Klingner Alt-Goldgrün,
blew me away. Mind you, this is mediocre paper. And it is amazing still."
jane,"November 24, 2011","I hesitated to order this pen because of the low price but after reading the
reviews I decided to try one.  Do yourself a favor and get one.  The pen does
not leak, it writes very smooth and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is
because once in a while it will hesitate at the very beginning of a word but it
is a minor amount  I have pens that cost a lot more money that do not write any
better.  So far I have only used cartridges since the converter does not come
with the pen."
SelfIsolation09,"November 20, 2011","Great pen, wish the tip was a bit thinner, but I guess that's just how German
fountain pens are. It also tends to collect ink at the top(nearest the hand) of
the nib... I'm used to it, but sometimes when I let somebody borrow my pen..they
get ink all over their fingers :P Great pen though!"
jane,"November 5, 2011","I am back to buy another pen just like the first one I bought.  They are smooth

sorry.  It even writes smooth on cheap paper!"
stitchinmaniac,"October 13, 2011","I really like Lamy pens because the design is so good, and they are durable. I
thought I would love this fountain pen, but found that the nib was a bit
scratchy for my taste. I'm thinking of purchasing a larger nib to swap out to
see if this makes a difference for me.  Also, I don't always write with a heavy hand, but when I do, the scratchiness is
very evident, even on my Rhodia paper. And, although I love the design, I can't
use this for long note-taking sessions because the grip is so hard.  So, I use
it for short notes and such.  My fav fountain pen for long note-taking sessions
is my Pelikan P55 Future fine tip.   If you don't often have fatigue in your hands when writing for long periods of
time, this is a great pen."

thicker. It does write extremely smooth. I do prefer to use the pen without
posting as it does not distribute the weight equally with the cap on. "
jysung,"November 13, 2010","This is a wonderful, durable fountain pen that\'s great for first-time FP users,

tradernat,"May 5, 2010","Bought and dislike.  I expect my fountain pens to write smoothly and flow consistently. Wth F nib,
this thing is scratchy and inconsistent. It disturbs me. I adjust it to write
smoothly and consistently by opening up the tins, but this makes the lines broad
instead of fine. With this adjustment, it makes writing a little more tolerable,
I still get better performance from my under $20 Jinhao pen.  I also use a slightly more expensive Pilot Cavalier that writes fine lines as I
would expect - smooth and consistent. If I had to do it again, I would pass on
this pen."
ngocduanguyen,"February 1, 2019",the product arrived is not what I ordered
Paul Hobart,"September 25, 2018","The Lamy Safari, matching its reputation, provides a smooth and consistent ink
flow. The triangle-shaped grip helps get a proper hold on the pen. The clip is a
bit big, but it works well. All that is good, but... the pen just feels cheap!
Lamy is very upfront about the type of plastic they use, and brag about the
""sturdy ABS plastic"" on their website. To be fair, the plastic is very sturdy,
impact resistant, and has an expected life of 50+ years. It is also very cheap
and easy to produce. There's not much heft to the pen, which only adds to the
feeling that it is cheap. It feels like the designers spent all their time and
effort on the writing mechanism, and then ran out of money. The nib writes like
a $50 pen, but the body feels like a $0.59 pen."
kadi.ashby,"May 17, 2014","Simply the best pen for the money.  I picked up a couple Metropolitans with fine
nibs when they came out in Japan, and am happy to see they are finally available
domestically.  I like this nib much more than the medium which I find a little
wide for everyday use (mostly note taking).  The fine nibs on these pens are
beautiful.  Very smooth, medium wetness, perfect for my uses. The Metropolitan
is absolutely the best value out there, don't hesitate to buy one for yourself."
Bannef,"December 3, 2016","I'm disappointed that I can't like it. What everyone says is true - it is well
made, it looks very expensive, and the nib writes like a dream, but I find it
too heavy, and my hand grows uncomfortable very quickly while using it. I have a
mild case of carpal tunnel which I think is part of the problem, so if that's an
issue for you, you might want to take the weight into account. But I know people
without carpal tunnel who also find heavier pens uncomfortable, it's also an
issue of personal preference. The heft is part of what makes it feel expensive, and I could see someone else
loving that same trait (which is why I still gave it a good number of stars) but
I just can't use it.I also tried an extra fine Lamy Safari at the same time, and although I don't
like the nib half as much, I have used that one much more than the Metropolitan
because it is more comfortable.Since then I have bought the Pilot Kakuno, which is the best of both worlds. I
have heard it is the same nib as the Metropolitan (with a smiley face added of
course), and I don't know that for sure, but it certainly writes just as well. I
wish I had bought the Kakuno to begin with, but now I know to avoid heavy pens
in the future, and I'm glad I found that out with a $15 pen instead of a $150
one! I am considering buying a Prera next, for days when I feel like looking a bit
more grown up than the Kakuno suggests. People say paying twice as much (the
Prera is around $30 while the Metropolitan is about $15) for inferior materials
is silly, and I get what they are saying, but if I can't use the Metropolitan
comfortably then it's not worth it.In conclusion, the Metropolitan works just as well as they say, but luckily
there are other options if it's not a good fit for you. And thank you Jetpens,
for making all of those options affordable and convenient!"
red251410,"June 17, 2014","Excellent fit & finish for such a price! The fine nib is more like a Western extra-fine. It's sharp but smooth.  I filled
the pen with Noodler's Ellis Island blue black and it wrote well right out of
the box.  After some writing, I decided I wanted a wetter flow and adjustment
was simple.  The nib and feed are friction-fit, they pulled out easily, and I
used .001 and .002 brass shims to open the space between the tines just a
little.  The nib and feed fit back in place in the section smoothly, and the ink
flow was perfect for me after that minor adjustment. All Metropolitan fountain pens have exactly the same black grip section that
holds the nib and feed. The nib and feed are similar to the nib and feed of the
Pilot 78G, but the Metropolitan's brass barrel and cap are much sturdier and
durable.  The cap goes on the barrel with a positive, firm-fitting, secure snap,
and it doesn't rotate around like on my more expensive Lamy Studio.  Also, if
one desires, the Metropolitan's cap can be firmly posted on the barrel. The Pilot Metropolitan, at the price, is an amazing, excellent value. Thanks to
JetPens for offering this fine writing instrument!"
robthornton,"December 1, 2014","This is my first fountain pen and I'm definitely enjoying it.  I appreciate that
it came with a case.  The big downside (and the only reason not to make it a
four or five) is that the cap doesn't attach securely.  I can't carry this pen
in my shirt pocket since the simple process of grasping it by the cap and
pulling it out of my pocket will bring the cap but leave the pen.  The pen then
slips to the side and the danger is that I'd get ink on my shirt.  So that's the
big problem with the Metropolitan - the cap doesn't attach securely so the
slightest pressure will release the pen."
slade,"December 16, 2014","I really enjoy this fountain pen. I use mine with Pelikan 4001 brilliant black,
I haven't even touched the cartridge that came with it. Extremely smooth writing
nib and such a good looking pen for only fifteen dollars. The cap is nice a
secure and keeps this pen from drying out very well. Not only is it great for
first timers to fountain pens but it looks so great that it is hard to pass up
for such a low price. It is also heavier than I though, or at least expected, and that is a good
thing. Doesn't feel cheaply made, has a nice solid feel to it."
Nils P,"March 18, 2016","I love the fact that Pilot made this pen and sold it without an artificial
price. This pen is pure function in a sleek package, the perfect entry pen. For
those seeking to climb the ladder of status or marginal returns, there are other
slightly better pens out there, but as the rung of the ladder goes higher, there
exists a point where the reins are handed over to placebo. This pen is not quite
there, but darn close. I recommend going with the CON-50 twist piston converter as it is much cleaner
to use compared to the stock converter, despite the marginally smaller ink pool.
If you are interested in italics, the nib of the Pilot Plumix will screw right
on this pen, as will the mentioned converter on the Plumix. Buy this pen. I did, and I love it!"

jjesse3d,"October 2, 2016","This pen is my first fountain pen, and it is by FAR the best pen that I ever
had. I bought a 10ml bottle of J. Herbin Perle Noire to go with it, and the
combination is fantastic. I have had this pen for about 2 months now. I use this
as my every day pen, and was originally using it to hand write a novel, but
since classes started I've been using it to write 5-15 pages of notes per week.The pen weighs more than any other pen that I've used, and I find that to be
quite comfortable ( I might even prefer a larger/heavier pen). I bought this
instead of the Lamy Safari because this looks more traditional, and I've heard
bad things about the clip on the Lamy. Regardless of some of the other reviews
that I've read, I find the cap to be very secure. I carry it clipped to the
inside of my shirt pocket almost every day without a problem. I bought a CON-50 converter to go with it, and that is all that I've used, so I
can't comment on the included one. The case that it comes with is nice, but the
see through window is flimsy. I have but a few tiny nicks in the finish on the
body from carrying it in my pocket with keys (I won't do that again), and the
bright brass metal contrasts very sharply with black finish. Lastly, I find the
Japanese Fine Nib to be very smooth, more so than any gel pen that I have used,
and bleeds VERY little on el cheapo notebook/copy paper, only a tiny bit more
than the G2. This certainly will not be my last fountain pen, but my research tells me that
it is the best pen I could have bought below $50, and maybe, dare I say, even
$100. Sure, pricey pens my be better (larger, heavier, better finish, have the
lever filler that I want SO badly), but not everybody can (or wants to) spend
$100+ on a pen, so for it's price, and even as a whole, this pen is definitely 5
stars. "
Jones,"September 27, 2015","Let's be honest. Once you get a taste for fountain pens and all the possibility
they offer, you likely won't want to write with anything else. And, after your
first Pilot Preppy is dead and gone, you may hunger for something more
substantial. Still on the the cheaper end of the spectrum, Pilot nonetheless
offers a lovely solution in this, the Metropolitan.You can use this pen even on standard, crappy Mead paper or that standard one
dollar composition book that offers little but space to write--if you order the
EF nib. I have a single gripe related to its pricing. It IS something of a
throwaway pen. I am a sailor and have dropped the thing while rushing through
the passageways doing my best not to shouldercheck any of my shipmates--the feed
broke and the pen had to be replaced. I keep it at my desk now. If you want a
tougher, but lighter and more maintainable beginner's pen, consider the Lamy
Safari--about twice as many dollars, able to survive many, many more drops--or
just don't be a clumsy SOB like me. "

good.  But maybe you had a cheap pen in the past and it was a leaky disaster.Or you've looked at the prices and decided it just wasn't worth paying that much
money just to try a pen.THIS IS THE PEN FOR YOU!It's only about fifteen bucks. It writes great. It doesn't leak all over. It
looks great.Buy this pen."
brutus,"February 11, 2022","I ordered this pen a couple of weeks ago, and I've been using it ever since. 
I've been using it with Noodler's American Eel Black and fine point for doing
math.This is a very solid pen that works perfectly every time I pick it up. It has
the solidity expected of a metal pen without excessive weight.  It fits the hand
nicely and writes well both on the nicer papers (eg CaireFontaine) as well as
more standard ones.  It fits my front pocket nicely to carry around and the clip
is secure.This pen came with the squeeze refill system which works fine.If I were to recommend one pen for someone to buy and have great results the
first time out of the box, this is the one.  "
monte_king,"December 7, 2014","My new favorite pen!  Feels like I'm writing with a just sharpened pencil or
mechanical pencil that never gets dull!  A Must Have!"
thomas,"January 14, 2022","Unbelievable pen for the price.  Every time I use it I'm impressed with how
smooth the steel nib is to write with.  I have Montblanc's to Lamy's in my
collection and it's right up there with the Montblanc."
Chris,"June 24, 2021","Pilot doesn't disappoint; I had the silver Metropolitan, lost it and after
searching high and low, repurchased it again in black.  Love this pen just as
much.  I wish it came with an extra fine nib, but the fine nib is good, in fact
a better write than some pens which claim to be an extra fine nib."
Sydney Tomlinson,"June 9, 2021","What an incredible pen, not just for the price, just a wonderful pen in general."
grayihuck,"June 7, 2021",Used it out all the time.
rcozad,"May 11, 2021","A perfect beginner's or value pen; I like mine more still than a nicer pen that
I bought later. If I'm going to be journaling or writing a long letter, I like
to reach for my Metropolitan for an assuredly delightful experience. It writes
so smoothly and the fine nib is the perfect size for my tiny handwriting. As
many others have said, the pen looks so much more expensive than it was, and it
has a lovely weight in the hand without being too heavy."
Scott,"June 25, 2018","Pilot Metropolitans are the best bargains in fountain pens. The steel nibs write
smoothly without smudging. These pens are far better than TWSBIs or Lamys
costing 3 or 4 times as much.  Easier to use and more dependable than other
steel nibbled pens.  Money spent on a TWSBI is wasted when you can buy several
Metropolitans for the same price.  They perform better than my beloved Safaris.
For a steel nib, there is nothing better than a Pilot Metropolitan. "
ahock07,"September 11, 2017","inexpensive but excellent writer.  I got a converter, though, because the
bladder is just a huge pain to ""sort of"" fill."
dnjedwards,"August 13, 2017","I love the feel and look of this pen, but I find it to be scratchy and hard to
sustain a steady supply of ink (using cartridges).  I have begun storing my pen
cap-down in a jar on my desk so that gravity will assist in keeping the nib
primed.  I recently purchased a Lamy Safari to try out, and my whole family
agrees we find it to be a much more enjoyable pen than the Metropolitan."
sandstorm640,"July 11, 2017","Best under $25 fountain pen out there, bar none. Great nib, love the Japanese F
size and it is fairly durable as well. I would recommend not posting the cap
with this pen. It scratches the paint..."
soterios,"June 13, 2017","I am in love with this pen.  It is such a quality writing instrument.  I'm sure
the $100+ are even more awesome, but it has to be a diminishing returns thing. 
I love writing with this great pen!"
ryan.grattan,"June 28, 2016","Fantastic pen.  I ended up swapping the EF nib from a Pilot Penmanship into this
body.  Very easy to do.  Now, this is my go-to pen.  I'll be picking up another
Penmanship+Metropolitan combo and doing this again for sure!"
WilliamE,"June 28, 2016","I love my Metros.  I bought the black one here so I could use a second color of
ink.  Consistent ink delivery, and the nib favorably reminds me of the cheap
Varsity disposables I used in college, although the nib is finer on the Metros. 
I switched to fountain pens because they're easier on my hands (darn carpal
tunnel!) than ballpoints or gels.  The ink cartridges could last a little
longer, but that's my only complaint.I prefer the looks of my gold Metro that I bought elsewhere, but the matte black
looks very professional and matches my black Metro ballpoint perfectly."
kellsey_t,"March 23, 2016","Works great! I use it with Noodlers black waterproof ink. The only possible,
tiny issue is that the ink converter only holds a supply for a few days, but
that's probably because I use it so frequently for drawing. Overall it's a great
pen and I definitely recommend it! "
jimskcc,"March 3, 2016","The Metropolitan F is an exceptional performer belying its pedestrian
appearance. It's quickly become my go-to pen for F writing. It's amazingly
reliable. Never hardstarting, never skipping. It's metal but not too heavy.
Beautifully engineered. Feels comfortable for long writing sessions. A
remarkable value. A most underrated pen."
joelzenny,"February 2, 2016","I didn't expect a quality pen for this price, but I love this pen.  It's a

definitely recommend this pen to my family and friends."
medina.jorge777,"October 8, 2015","Amazing pen. The only complaint I have is that the grip is glossy plastic and my
fingers move and slide a lot when I'm holding, wish it had some kind of texture."
jesscurr,"September 8, 2015","An amazing pen for the price. The nib is very fine, and the pen itself is
fantastic quality and has a nice feel to it. It comes in a nice case with a
converter as well, which was great. I love this body too - it's very
professional looking."
bcreepette,"July 6, 2015","My very first fountain pen I bought! Been using this beauty for about 4 months
now, and, I gotta say,I'm enjoying this very much. With that said, I've written
with this pen mostly on cheap, economic school notebooks. I can't afford writing
on more expensive paper, sadly. However, writing on cheap paper hasn't been a
chore for me; the pen is really smooth! I'm not very fond of the plastic ring
and the plastic around the nib, my fingers are obviously always touching it when
writing, and it seems to leave behind a lot of fingerprint smudges because of
the gloss (I think?) finish it has around that area. But for this price, I ain't
complaining at the quality. I especially love that metallic finish to this pen
-- it gives it a classy finish. Some people say that this pen is heavy, but I
never really noticed the weight. Then again, it is my first FP! I'd recommend it for other students who're looking for budget FPs that would
perform moderately well with cheap paper.Also, this took me a while to figure out, but twist the nib out of the pen the
first time you try to take it out-- don't just try to pull it out. It made a
horrible crack sound for me, but nothing broke. The nib won't come out the first
time around if you simple pull, at least for my pen it didn't. It seemed to be
stuck in there real tight, but after I twisting it out the first time, pulling
out the nib became MUCH easier.  A side note for other students like me who're looking into pens for cheap
notebook paper: This pen is really, really fine which keeps the bleed-through
and feathering minimal. On most of my notebook and copy papers, it performed
great! There are some ghosting here and there on the back, but it shouldn't be
too much of a problem. I recommend looking at where those notebooks are made
from; people online say ""Made in Mexico"" are usually the better ones, or any
notebook that's made from sugar canes or what not. I've been using Staple
notebooks made in Vietnam -- it's been decent. Funny though, my notebook that
claims to be made in ""New York"" is really absorbent and causes my writing to
become broader and feathery. Anyway, just look for smoother notebooks."
jlw951,"June 14, 2015","The Start of a New Hobby,This fountain pen was what sparked my interest into the world of fountain pens.
The design is modern and sleek and the weight feels perfect. The fact that it
comes with a converter makes trying out different types of ink fairly easy.
Although i do not have much experience, nor do i have other fountain pens to
compare this too, I believe this pen succeeds at what it was made to do. Which
is be a affordable and reliable everyday writer. Also it comes with a nice case
which I use to house others pens as well. Overall great buy and I couldn't be
happier. "

on one of my rants."
bredecarter,"April 14, 2015","This is my first fountain pen ever and I am in love!  The flow of the ink is so
smooth and beautifully made, my only thing is, being that this was my first

the user how to fill the ink.  I'm still not sure of the difference, I've had to
go through You Tube to find out but I figured it out in the end.Also service/delivery is fantastic, JetPens, you are awesome!"
maxholloway,"April 9, 2015","This is a great starters fountain pen. This is the first fountain pen I have
ever used, and immediately I was addicted to the realm of fountain pens. These
are very good writers, and the ink that comes in its cartridge is a great black
color.Pros:Feels good in the hand.Gives a nice, thin line.Comes with very nice, dark ink.It is very attractive.Con:If you use this with low-quality notebook paper, you will not be as satisfied.
It will not feel as smooth as if you were to use Rhodia paper or something of
that sort. This is not a complaint about this particular pen, as this applies to
any fountain pen, but just keep this in mind. "
vanden,"February 7, 2015","A proper Pilot nib on a metal body fountain pen for less than 20$? What is there

ebenfatto,"September 21, 2014","One of my favorite pens (and I own many, many fountain pens). The metal body is
substantial but nicely balanced. I can write continuously for 2-3 hours with
this pen and have no hand fatigue. The ink flow is perfect - wet enough to flow
quickly as you write, but not so wet that the ink requires more time than usual
to dry. The nib is smooth - tines perfectly aligned, the tipping well polished.
It's an unbelievably good value for the price point, and it puts other, much
more expensive pens, to shame."

xcg16,"July 26, 2022","This is a great starter pen. It has a premium design that makes it look like
it's worth much more than 20 dollars. The pen writes about as fine as a 0.5 mm
gel pen or a 0.7 mm ballpoint pen. It is a steel nib so there is no line
variation, making it good for daily writing. The snap cap fastens securely and
is easy to use. The nib is very smooth despite its small size. This is
absolutely one of the best starter pens: its price is very low, but it is so
high-quality. The ink cartridge it came with was nice (though it could be a bit
darker black). The converter (Pilot CON-B) is high-capacity and works well.
Great value."
Shawn,"July 21, 2022","For what it is this pen is amazing. The metal construction feels sturdy and the
nib on it is stellar for the cost. My only issue is that the majority of the
weight seems to be in the cap, which makes the balance sometimes weird, but
still 5 stars. "
joliepaige622,"July 3, 2022","Really nice beginner fountain pen! I have paired it with J Herbin perle noire
and it has been great for taking notes in class on kokuyo paper (the rougher one

more special and fun."

needs the cap on the end to feel right, but it totally feels right."
conrad.marotta,"June 6, 2022","Great pen, writes really well and I like the feel. I am using it as an everyday

pvbiblioholic,"November 1, 2021","I used to use a fountain pen all through at least high school but somewhere
along the line I stopped. Maybe the lack of essays and term papers to turn in
plus when I started working we were supplied with ball point pens. Then in the
1980s I was using ceramic pens and finally roller ball pens into the present. I
did write one letter so far with the fountain pen and noticed my handwriting
looked different... like from the past. Is that possible because we hold a
fountain pen different from other pens? It has a great heft and feel. Thanks."

I use it with the converter and bottle ink. I am not an expert in the topic of
fountain pens, though I have been using them for a very long time. After using
it awhile, I did take the liberty of polishing the end of the nib with a leather
strop charged with jeweler's rouge. In my opinion, the pen seems to write more
smoothly. I am very satisfied with this pen, and it is a daily carry pen for me."

I got it basically for sketching and I like to work quickly. Although not
practical to push it as hard as a ball-point, I can still work pretty quickly
and the ink does not dry out and flows well. I got the fine point and my next
will be a bolder nib. It feels pretty good when held and has a bit of weight so
it does not feel plastic and cheap. Having used rapidographs for years (yes, I'm
old ; ) fountain pens seem to be a bit more organic and surely to be less of a
maintenance hassle. I look forward to trying out some different inks for both
sketching and writing. "

pens) and they are nice, but this is smooth. I found NO catching while writing.
I did slow down my writing - not my normal fast messy style - so I can't comment
on quick writing.Mine came WITH a squeeze converter. Nothing in the packaging said what it was,
but I'm pretty sure that's what it is. Had I known (the description says it's
POSSIBLE), I'd have not also bought the twist converter to go with, but I might
venture out to getting a fountain pen for calligraphy, so that'll be good to
have."

Samuel Reed,"September 1, 2020","Excellent starter pen! I bought the Metropolitan as my introduction into
fountain pens; I've used it just about every day since then - not only is it
more economical and ecological to use compared to tearing through disposable
pens, it's also honestly a joy to write with.The brass body looks classy and sleek and has the perfect amount of heft and
coolness to feel very nice in the hand, the nib writes as smooth as can be, and
all for a stunningly reasonable price, making it a fantastic place to jump into
the world of fountain pens and see if they're right for you.A couple of small critiques, but not enough to knock it down a star in my
opinion: First, I bought mine shortly before they stopped coming with the
converter - I highly recommend one to open up the world of inks. I understand
why Pilot can't offer a free converter with a metal-body pen at such a low price
point forever, but it's still too bad the pen no longer comes with the converter
bundled. Second, the cap doesn't feel like it's meant to be posted. You can post
it for sure, but I worry about it scuffing the finish of the pen's body (that
might just be me over-thinking it), and the weight starts to feel top-heavy if
you do; I always leave my cap unposted instead, and the balance feels perfect
that way.Overall, a really wonderful starting point for anyone looking to try out
fountain pens; I highly recommend this pen to anyone."

pomerleau.zachary,"June 9, 2020","Review being written June 9, 2020; product received June 8, 2020As I saw accompanying a JetPens logo in one of the order e-mails, this pen was
love at first write. This is my first purchase of a pen that didn't come in a
pack of multiple for a cheap price and my first fountain pen to boot. After
opening the box, I laid eyes on this fantastic writing instrument through it's
clear plastic window in the case it came in and thought to myself, ""Wow..."" as
feelings of pride and joy welled up in me.I purchased this to begin to take pride in my writing style, to encourage me to
improve my third-grade penmanship, and I will definitely make it a point to
write with this pen. My one disappointment is that with the cap and my
preference to have it posted, it does not work well with my occupation. Pros and
cons with anything, right? While I also noticed today (thanks to one of the many
outstanding guides and articles hosted on this website) that there is a
retractable fountain pen, a gel pen with archival ink is probably my best bet to
continue using at work. Other than that, this will absolutely be my go-to after
only one day of use."
angelinagao10,"June 9, 2020","Really nice pen! I was worried at first because some other reviews mention the
cap becoming loose, but mine clicks tightly shut and I'm very happy with it. "
kieranhulick98,"June 8, 2020",Lovely for a first time fountain pen owner.
dayonpark,"June 5, 2020","First time using a fountain pen so nothing for me to compare it too. But....Very smooth, ink flow is consistent. Fine nib writes somewhat close to a 0.5mm.
Very different feel compared to a gel or a ballpoint and very addicting.Good
purchase! "

get to enjoy it. The moment i inked it i dropped it and the nib bent "
Amanda,"May 18, 2020","Simply amazing! The Pilot Fine Nib is my first ever fountain pen purchase. I
received it today, less than a week after purchase, even though I was not
expecting it for another week! The best part for me is that it writes like a
dream, even on regular notebook paper! Thank you Jetpens, you have earned my
business!!"

luciamaria36,"May 7, 2020","1st fountain pen, and Iove it!"
Ryan,"April 22, 2020","Incredible value.  Very smooth to write with, barely any complaints.  It's a
liiiiittle bit small for larger hands if you don't post the cap.  Great first
fountain pen - I lost mine and didn't hesitate to buy another one to replace it."
wagendrei,"April 14, 2020","Excellent pen at an affordable price.  I insist on a truly extra fine nib, and
Pilot delivers. I swapped out the fine nib on this pen for an EF nib from the
Pilot Penmanship I also purchase.  Good weight, good feel in my hand, and no
hiccups getting started. It came with a squeeze converter which I don’t like
but I used a cartridge I had lying around instead. Great product!"
shahaniaoscar,"March 29, 2020",This nib is so smooth for how tiny it is! I love using this for chapter notes!
seiryram,"March 27, 2020","This is my first fountain pen and I just can't put it down. It writes so
smoothly and the ink is dries more quickly than I thought it would. Great pen. "
demetra2000,"March 18, 2020","This pen is amazing!!!! It is incredibly affordable yet looks very classy. Love
the extra fine point, with which it writes. My husband owns a Mont Blanc, but I
think my Pilot is superior! "
seulg2,"March 13, 2020","I've been using this fountain pen for a while now, and I have to say... in the
beginning, this was amazing. I loved the effortless flow and ever-so-slight
scratch that came from this pen. However! I noticed that if I didn't touch this
pen in a while (and subsequently just stored it away), the ink would run dry and
empty. This is not that big of a problem, but my recent lack of use - almost
half a year - due to testing out other pens has caused the nib to be lackluster.
May be due to user error... after all, this was my first fountain pen; I'm just
a little disappointed that I can't use this pen again like when I first
unearthed it from its packaging. Any tips would be amazing to get this pen back
in shape... unless I just have to buy a new one? Kept the review at 4 stars because it did serve me well."
sully.yankovich,"March 9, 2020","Excellent pen with a ‘giving’ nib. The nib has a subtle touch to it which
make using it a real pleasure. "
d.gardnerstacy,"March 3, 2020","This pen works very well, the ink flow is uniform, and leaves a good fine line.
I'm completely satisfied with the Pilot Metropolitan and it compares very
favorably with pens I've used in the past made by other companies. I'll be
returning here periodically to buy cartridges."
pgiller,"February 25, 2020","Q good pen, very fine nib, well made. A good alternative to an Indian Parker."

mikestjohnatx,"December 12, 2019","First time with fountain pen. I like it, but I need to get used to it. "
Carl,"December 6, 2019","Very smooth nib; a joy to write with. I find it writes better than a Kakuno.The cap posts on the end but feels a bit loose.The pen feels a bit heavy, especially compared to the Kakuno. Tastes will vary
on if that’s good or bad. Looks very fancy."
Fountain pen lover,"November 12, 2019","I own two of these pens as does my husband.  We both have the Metropolitan in
different colors and nibs (fine and medium).  While I enjoy how smoothly these
pens write what drives me totally crazy is how much they leak!  Where the feed
meets the section is always inky and gets on my fingers on both pens.  I thought
it was the cartridges or the ink so I got a converter and filled it with
different ink and nope, same thing.  Also happens to both of my husband's
metros.  It would be just about perfect but for the leak!  "
dorothyanimemangafong,"October 31, 2019",A beautiful pen that write beautifully as well
IbrahimHadad41,"October 28, 2019","Amazing pen, but be aware that the converter is actually included so don't waste
money on a converter."
blahblahblah,"October 9, 2019","Oh, the exciting pen review. Ok, I like pens. I am a sucker for a good pen.
Previously I have been using a variety of cheap Chinese pens. Cheap, with mixed
results. I have finally stepped up and ordered this lovely pen, the Pilot
Metropolitan in black with a fine nib. This has now become my daily writer. The
nib, which I would consider to be extra fine to fine, flows well. I have not had
any issue with skipping or anything like that. I generally write pretty small
and it handles it well. It is slightly scratchy but has a good feel going across
the paper. As a daily, I am using it with a variety of papers and bleed through
is minimal. I am still able to use the back of pages if needed. It has managed
to keep up with quick writing. I love the feel of the pen in my hand. Very
sturdy with lots of metal. I use the included converter which is a little small
but still better than using cartridges. It fills quick with no issues. My only
negative is that it is not very good for signatures. If you write large you may
want a larger nib.  I mean what else do you want to know about a pen? The design
looks like a pen. Clean and simple. Nothing flashy about it. A classic look. You
are not going to WOW anybody with it. It writes well so that makes it a
successful pen. Summary: The pen writes well and is a good value for the price. I am not letting
people borrow it. I am glad a bought it and if you are looking for a good daily
pen I would recommend. It does what it is supposed to do. "
trboat,"October 7, 2019",The pen is excellent.  It was a great buy.
chriscomerse,"September 25, 2019","I'm a first-time fountain pen user and this Pil!ot Metropolitan is a great pen
for me! I love the weight of the pen and it writes very well with the included ink
cartridge."
katieduran76,"August 27, 2019","This is my first ever fountain pen, and I absolutely love it. I know I can't
compare it to much, but I have to say that you get more than what you pay for.
The feel of the pen is so nice and it feels smooth in the hand. My only regret
is not buying this pen sooner. It would've saved me so much more money. I am
using Noodler's Ottoman Azure ink btw. "
brokeak,"August 26, 2019","Quality pen and amazing writer for the price, beats some higher priced pens for
me."
Lizard Party,"August 13, 2019","Good pen.I enjoyed this pen while it lasted. I think it was about a year of heavy use
when the nib began to leak heavily. This could be my own fault or just wear. I
do still recommend this pen because it worked wonderfully while I used it."
victron74,"August 6, 2019","I’m new to fountain pens, but I really like the way this one writes. The cap
does come off very easy, but mostly that is a good thing. Very happy so far."
baron_oso,"August 6, 2019","As a rookie in fountain pen writing I wanted a pen that was affordable and easy
to use. With all the reviews I decided on the metropolitan and I can honestly
say I am happy with it, is easy to handle, using it is no t difficult, no mess
with the ink, I really like it. "
Rollie,"July 25, 2019","I bought a much more expensive fountain pen for myself a few months ago. It is a
very nice pen and I have enjoyed writing with it. My wife mentioned that she
might like a fountain pen as well, so I bought her a Pilot Metropolitan for her
birthday. When it got here I was so impressed that I bought another one for
myself. It is every bit at good as my other more expensive pen. Okay, In my
short and limited experience with fountain pens I have one deal breaker. It has
to start writing immediately without a skip. This pen never skips.  "
dwight.carter2,"June 24, 2019",Received the pen on time and totally satisfied. Pen works to my expectations.

palffyzoltan,"April 20, 2019","The metropolitan,  penmanship,  prera and  the 78g have the same nib
(essentially). I buy these pens for their nibs really. Great value for the
money! "
winksandgiggles89,"April 18, 2019","A great looking pen that writes well. It's definitely sturdy, but the weight of
it makes it uncomfortable to use for longer writing sessions. I have just a
touch of arthritis in my hands and wrist and if I'm writing longer than five
minutes at a time I start having problems, so if you're in the same boat I'd go
with a lighter pen, maybe plastic or aluminum. I still really like this pen and
use it at work where I only have to write in quick bursts."
abjonespsyd,"April 11, 2019",Bigger than I usually get but it writes so smoothly I don't mind. 
RFV,"March 22, 2019","I bought this as an afterthought, and am glad I did. A very nice basic pen, I
use it with Waterman Audacious Red, a bright and happy red. The 'Fine' point
suits it. You wouldn't really know this is an inexpensive pen when you pick it
up, handle it, write with it - frankly, it writes much better than a hundred
buck Sonnet I have. I'll buy a second one for a different ink color soon..."
jreitman4,"March 19, 2019",As a new fountain pen owner I think this pen is terrific
scottda2,"March 18, 2019","Love this pen. Just getting started and purchased a few inexpensive recommended

apark,"November 26, 2018","Writes smooth, great weight in hand. I bought a Prera before my Metropolitan,

for this price I can afford to be finicky. The repaired one will make a nice

petersonhoops1,"July 19, 2018","This pen writes a nice line with the piston converter.  (It ships with a bladder
converter but I prefer the piston variety.)  There's some friction but it's well
within spec and less than one expects for the money.  This will be a daily-use
pen for me.  At the price, I can bring it to work or take it out in the world
without fearing that losing or dropping it will bankrupt me.  Planning to order
another to load for grading exams."

the fine nib will be too fin, but turned out it is much thicker than I expected.
I immediately recommended this product to my friends. Unbelievably easy to

expected. "

thebobedwards,"May 8, 2018",If you want to try a fountain pen this is it!
petersoares52,"May 7, 2018","5/5 but I want to talk about a few things other reviews don't talk about.1. The pen cap opens and closes with a snap. I like to open and close caps that
have a click/snap and this one does that.2. I spin my pens when I'm reading or when I'm thinking of something to write.
So I'm sure there will come a time when I drop it and damage the nib. If you're
a pen spinner, consider buying some backup nibs.3. The style - I really like that this pen doesn't call attention to itself. I
don't like products that project a brand for everyone to see. This pen is just
black. You can get it in other colors, but I like that it doesn't call attention
to itself.4. The ink is like 95% black - it's a dark grey not a pure jet black similar to
a micron pen or a sharpie.5. On printer paper or inexpensive paper, the ink appears to bleed like 0.25mm
from the sides of the strokes you make. On higher grade paper, like Apica
notebooks, the pen doesn't do this. It's almost like the lower quality paper
soaks up the ink while the higher grade paper doesn't, and it appears sharper on
higher grade paper. But Microns are still my favorite because they're always
sharp regardless of the paper you write on.6. MOST IMPORTANT - some of the parts are plastic. the body is metal but the
part that holds the feeder is plastic. I don't think this will be an issue, but
over time I do see it being worn out simply because it's made out of plastic.Overall, great pen."
Emerald,"May 6, 2018","The Pilot Metropolitan is a joy to write with. It uses a steel nib that feels
just as smooth as some other gold nibs and works well with any ink I put in it.
I particularly enjoy Noodler's Baystate Concord Grape in it. The Metropolitan
has some weight to it due to it's metal construction, but it doesn't bother me
that much. The weight is comparable to that of the Rotring 600 -- noticeable but
not hindering, even in long writing sessions. The weight is reassuring to me, as
it lets me know that I have a sturdy, well-made pen in my hands. The pen fits
fell in larger pockets like those on sweatpants, but it wouldn't fit in smaller
pockets considering it is around 4.5 inches long when capped and around 5.5
inches long when posted. The pen's looks are simple and classy with no flashy or
unnecessary parts tacked on -- This pen is all business. It also comes in a
variety of colors to choose from. The (arguably) greatest part of the
Metropolitan is it's price, costing only a little over $20 with tax. This is why
it is my EDC pen, as it's much easier to replace than a Pilot 912 or Lamy 2000
is it is lost or stolen. I would recommend the Metropolitan to fountain pen
beginners and experts alike, as it is a great addition to any collection due to
it's smoothness, build quality, and low cost."
SusieQ,"April 11, 2018","Based on the reviews here, I got one.  Sorely disappointed.  Fine is like a .05
ballpoint.  Very light in the hand but I found the nib slushy.  I guess i will
save it for check writing."
Chris,"April 5, 2018","Didn't work well for me. The filling mechanism didn't work well., The cartridge
was ok, but the pen dried out or didnt write well. I tossed it out in a short
amount of time. Lesson learned."

ellenholbert,"January 3, 2018","I bought three of these as christmas gifts (including one for myself) having
only a small amount of experience with fountain pens when I was a kid. These
pens were highly recommended for their performance, quality, and price and I
feel they have lived up to their reputation. Additionally, the people I bought
them for have not put them down since they opened them. All three of us are
artists and enjoy using them for drawing in addition to practical every day use.
The reason I became interested in them in the first place was to combat the use
of disposable writing utensils. Overall I would recommend this product. "
sophieseabrook,"December 7, 2017","This was my first fountain pen and so far I love it! The case it comes in is
kinda flimsy and I don't like the converter that comes with it very much, but it
writes smoothly. An issue I have with this pen a lot is nib creep, though. I
opened the cap (while sitting on my white bedspread, no less) and when I looked
down there were brown spots all over my sheet because of the brown ink I had
filled it with. There is also a lot of feathering, but I think most of that has
to do with my ink and paper choices. I would definitely recommend this pen as an
entry level fountain pen, though!"
kyleshepp,"December 5, 2017","My first pen and what a start! I can write for days with this thing and it keeps
the pace with me every time! Smooth, almost effortless writing and very
conservative with ink (Fine nib). The pen has a nice weight posted and unposted
although the cap is weighty and can feel alien to those not used to it. If I
could recommend a fountain pen to dive head first into it would be this one."
vanessaishereforyou,"November 10, 2017",Works great! As my first Fountain Pen this was really easy to use.
jppelt,"November 8, 2017","I bought this for my son.  He has a few Lamy Safaris.  This is just a wonderful
beginner's fountain pen.  Highly recommend as an everyday, no hassle, great
Pilot fountain for anyone who enjoys using fountain pens.  Well constructed. 
Smooth nib - fine draws nice lines.  Filled effortlessly.  At this price, can't
go wrong.  I like the Lamy colors but this feels more solid than the Safaris. "
joy.pietschmann,"November 7, 2017",LOVE this pen. Writes so smoothly and ink flows well. Love the fine nib. 
cremins,"October 20, 2017","This is a lovely pen with a nice heft to it, but I really wish the nib were
thinner. Probably just because I'm used to teeny tiny ball points though. Worth
the money for sure."

harodriguezcamejo,"October 17, 2017",The pen is very good but delivery was delayed
westonpreecs1108,"October 14, 2017","Very easy to use, haven't had any issues."
Ali H,"October 4, 2017","I really enjoy using this pen. The weight makes the pen ""feel"" more expensive
than the actual amount, and the shape is exactly what I imagine when thinking of
a traditional capped fountain pen. The only issue I have with it is the amount
of leakage whenever I uncap it; storing this with the nib pointing up has helped
immensely, but I feel like even then there are always a few drops of ink on the
nib. I tried wiping the cap insides, but it hasn't really done much, so if you
purchase this, don't be surprised to see this happen."
migz,"September 22, 2017","I agree with just about everyone that's left a positive comment on this pen. The feel is nice, solid, and sturdy. I originally thought the cap and barrel
were a tough plastic, but was pleasantly surprised when i first held it, and
felt it was metal. The pen as a nice weight to it, not heavy, but feels solid.
The fine point nib is nice and smooth and i enjoy the ""click"" that's made when
you cap the pen. It adds to the solidness of the experience. Now i'm trying to find more excuses to write with it more. I wish i could have
written this review with the pen itself. Quality at an affordable price is hard
to find these days. Pick this pen up before Pilot figures out the gem they've
created."
mycupofteax23,"September 9, 2017","This is by far the best fountain pen! I purchased this as a gift and the person
who received it absolutely loved it! They use it everyday! "
Tom Knechtel,"August 28, 2017","For the money (very little), this seems to be a good, reliable fountain pen, and
fairly handsome too!"
luke,"August 10, 2017","The nib is great.  The ink is great. The added converter is also great. The
fine, clean lines certainly don't disappoint me. This is especially true as it's
a Japanese company with Japanese nib sizes (which tend to run finer than typical
western sizes if you haven't heard already).  The firm click you get when
capping the pen is a nice subtle reminder of how solid the construction is.
However, it feels fairly heavy which may be something I need to get accustomed
to since I'm more used to lighter, plastic pens. Because it's a metal bodied pen
with a matte finish, you can't just toss it around and be too carefree with it.
Overall, the design is excellent. It gives the aura of professionalism while
sporting a classy look. As a fan of slim bodied pens, I can't say I completely
appreciate the bullet-like shape of the pen, but that's more of a personal
preference. Definitely an excellent choice for beginner fountain pen
enthusiasts."

aawillis1956,"May 1, 2017","I bought this pen because of all the positive reviews out there. I'm not sure
what I was expecting but this pen didn't meet my expectations. It's a very bland

will continue to meet basic needs without any flare for quite awhile. It's a pen
and it's inexpensive."

jetfan,"February 28, 2017","Nice fine and consistent line produced by this pen.  For my tastes and usage I
wish it were a millimeter or two shorter and a bit lighter to fit more easily in
my shirt pocket.  It's fairly heavy.  Very easy to write with, with some
significant feedback, but not truly scratchy, even on cheap notebook paper."
calthrasher,"February 22, 2017","I really enjoy the fine nib over the medium one. The medium is fine on certain
papers or larger font size, but the fine one is better for most uses. You can't
beat the price on these metropolitans. "
yeomso27,"February 21, 2017","Great pen, though it doesn't have a lot of line variance but that's fine. It writes smoothly and not scratchy and the ink comes smoothly as well. It has a

the pen opening in my bag."

yamashta,"January 25, 2017","For the cost, it is a very good, functional pen. I cannot achieve super fine
detail, and on the paper I tested it on the ink it came with does feather a
little, but putting this aside it flows well enough and is comfortable to hold.
It is sleek, comes in a handsome case, and is tidy. The case is very
travel-friendly, too."

BLeeds,"December 8, 2016"," An outstanding fountain pen from Pilot.  This is the pen that turned me on to

nice."

yellwcrane,"August 15, 2016","They weren't kidding when they said the nib was smooth. Cause, dammmn is it
smooth. I was pretty surprised, but very very satisfied. I love the weight it
has, and writing with it is as smooth as a baby's bottom. I absolutely love it."
lexidoidge,"July 19, 2016","I really like this pen. This is my second fountain, and I really like the fine
nib as I have smaller handwriting. When reading reviews for this pen, I often
read that the cap would fall off while it was posted, but I haven't had any
issues as of yet, and I've had this pen for awhile now. I do often have hand
fatigue when writing with this pen, but it usually comes after writing many
pages in my journal. The pen is a bit heavier, but for quick everyday notes, I
like the weight behind the pen. "
aduong5354,"July 15, 2016","Great pen. Very smooth out of the box. I wish I had purchased this as my first
fountain pen instead of the Lamy Safari. I only wish that there was an EF nib
option for the Metropolitan."
nvanrysseghem,"July 4, 2016","I have never used a fine nib before. I have both italic 1.1 and medium nibs on
all of my pens. But wow! The ink flows just as smooth, and wet. I have more
control over my writing. I can write in the margins, make quick corrections
without worrying about the line being so thick as to obscure what I had written
previously. And for the price? What's not to love?"
Amber,"June 30, 2016","This pen is heavy! But the fine nib is a little too fine for me, wish I would

one got me hooked. I take it with me everywhere I go."
Nena,"March 30, 2016","Let me state first off that I loved this pen when I got it! I used it almost
everyday. I had to change the ink in less than a month, which was pretty awesome
considering how often I used it. But after about 3 months or so the plastic must have a little crack because it
bleeds /everywhere/ when you use it. The weird thing is that it doesn't bleed
when not in use.. So if you want a awesome first time fountain pen then go get this, but don't
expect it to last long with continued use. "
bzillathrilla,"March 24, 2016","Excellent build quality for the cost, and it writes wonderfully! Feels better

NZ newbie,"February 23, 2016","Excellent fountain pen experience, I recently started using fountain pens and

johnlambrecht,"February 22, 2016","I love it.   Writes wonderful.Thanks,       John"
rachelewheeler,"February 18, 2016","I bought this pen as a gift, but I'm a bit of a fountain pen enthusiast and had
to try it out myself. It writes so smooth, smoother than any of my own fountain
pens, and the body is weighted well and sturdy. Personally I prefer my fountain
pens to be a little more lightweight, but I can definitely enjoy writing with
this pen regardless. Writing for extended periods of time surprisingly doesn't
tire out my hand at all, though I expected it would. Overall, this pen is an
amazing deal for how high quality it is and I would absolutely recommend it."
skinnedfrog,"February 16, 2016","Such a beautiful pen! This is my first fountain pen and I'm so happy with it.
It's so smooth and lovely to write with. Highly recommended!"
marisol.ramos,"February 1, 2016","Love this pen!! Easy to hold and write. The ink flow nicely and without

fountain pen user at this point."
theodelinda58,"September 25, 2015","This is a beautiful pen with a good, solid feel, and is an excellent pen for the
price. It writes smoothly and is in the sweet spot between too light and
too-heavy. The first pen I ordered came with a bent nib, but when I returned it the
replacement was handled promptly and with no fuss whatsoever. The replacement
was in perfect shape."
jljamison2,"August 25, 2015","The pen writes out of the box flawlessly and with the ease of a more expensive

Sharpshooter,"November 18, 2014","Best inexpensive fountain pen I've ever had, bar none. Better than many I've had
that were three and four time the money. One note: You really need the Nakimi refills or bottled ink as other inks are
thicker and gum up the nibs ink flow,"
jpallares38,"November 1, 2014",Good looking pen.. not heavy at all. Good nib
jbsanchez,"October 27, 2014",Rest well in hand. Inks smoothly as I draw or doodle. 
larryhr,"October 25, 2014","I have two Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pens filled with blue and black inks. 
They are nice writing pens.  For narrow line spacing, I wanted a fine nib.  I
ordered the Metropolitan with fine nib expecting it to be similar to the the
fine nib on my Pilot FP-78G.  Filled with Pilot black ink in a cartridge, it has
gotten much use.  Although the nib is not as smooth as the much used 78G, it is
very good.  A silver plain body is on the list for my next order, so I will have
one filled with blue ink.  I used the supplied converters on the medium nib
Metropolitan pens.  However, because the converter does not hold as much ink as
a cartridge and you can not see how much ink is left, they have have been
confined to my desk where ink bottles are handy.  This is a very good pen for a
very reasonable price."
pschlotthauer,"September 24, 2014","It's hard to believe this pen is so inexpensive!  It has the look and feel of a
much more costly pen, and it writes like a dream.  The fine point nib is a more
like an extra fine, as is the case with Pilot pens, but it writes very smoothly
without any scratching.  It lays down a line that, despite its thinness, is
fairly wet; in fact, I found it feathered and bled slightly on Doane paper,
which I would not have expected.  Even after the cap has been off for a short
time, it still writes without skipping.  The Pilot Metropolitan is an excellent
value for the money and is quickly becoming one of my favorite go-to pens."
lisasa,"July 7, 2014"," I love it. It glides smoothly on paper. The only negative thing I can say about it is the ink that comes with it. Yes
it's a pretty good dark black but it does feather some on cheap notebook paper.
Great price. Great pen. Period. "
Akdge,"January 7, 2021","Not impressed. This was the first fountain pen I purchased and I like it the
least of all my fountain pens. (My favorite being the Pilot Kakuno.) It is by no
means “fine tipped” and the ink cartridge it comes with is very wet and slow
drying. It looks nice, writes smooth, and would make a nice gift, but not if you
like an actual fine tip pen."
Btshails,"August 26, 2020","This is a great quality pen but not exactly what I expected. Since ordering this
pen and then doing some more research I found that Japanese “fine” nibs are
much closer to an American “extra fine”. I am a sucker for a buttery smooth
writing experience so for me this is too scratchy. The quality is still
spectacular and i have nothing bad to say if very fine point is your preference,
just wanted to add this note so others don’t make my same mistake."
melisande28,"January 8, 2020","Sadly, I cannot get behind the hype over this pen.  The nib is way too fine
(finer than usual ""fine"" point pens), and it writes very scratchy, often tearing
the page.  The pen is beautifully constructed, hence my disappointment over the
quality of writing.  I am left-handed and perhaps this is a problem limited to
people who push the nib across the page.  This pen is simply not for me."
ThePoorPenman,"April 13, 2016","Great first fountain pen, but more a gateway that a solution. It's a little
boring to look at after a while."
rfkannen,"February 10, 2016","It was really good! The tip broke when I dropped it on concrete, but that is
fairly normal."
zaur s,"March 20, 2019",The worst pen I’ve ever owned.
jviiffvii,"December 28, 2016",It is a waste of time and money. Poor instructions and poor quality.
hydrospanner,"January 18, 2017","This was the only item from my first JetPens order that I really wasn't pleased
with.I'm not sure if it's the fast-drying ink or an issue with the individual pen I
happened to get, or what, but it usually takes quite a bit of doodling on
scratch paper just to get the ink started flowing, and then it'll write well for
maybe a line or two before it dries out again and gets very light and starts
skipping.It's strange because I also picked up the red version of the same pen and while
it too needs a bit of encouragement to get started, once it's working, it works
well.  This one, on the other hand, has been nearly unusable since day one."
med student,"August 3, 2018","FINALLY! I write mostly in an extra large, ruled moleskine notebook for medical
school. I had tried a lot of different pens before this one (energel, sarasa
clip, pilot, uniball signo) in a lot of different sizes (from 0.3 to 0.7). Every
single one of those pens was either too scratchy or did not dry fully and
therefore kept causing smears on my notebook. I'm right handed but I hold my hand in a weird way so that my hand actually
rests above whatever I am writing. So when I'm writing in my notebook, I place
my hand on whatever I've just immediately written as I move down to the next
line of writing. The ink would ALWAYS get smeared all over my right hand and
it's been like this my entire life. I just never really cared too much until I
actually started to need these notes much more now that I'm in med school. So I finally ordered these sarasa dry gel pens in a .4mm and a .5mm and they
both dry instantly in my moleskine notebook. I can immediately set my hand on
what i've just written and it does not pick up or smudge at all. I saw in these
reviews that one person commented they were having the same issue with this pen
that I was having with other pens. But that is not the case for me at all! These
pens completely solved my problems. This is officially the only pen I will ever
purchase again. Side note, I do prefer the .4mm to the .5mm. The .4mm is not scratchy at all and
writes about the same thickness line as my .5 energel. I don't know why people
are saying the .4mm is scratchy, because it isn't. However, my energel .3mm was
very scratchy which is why I ditched it (just for comparison). The .5mm is a little thick for me. It writes more like a pilot g2 .7mm in my
opinion. So if you like a nice thick line, go with that one.Again, this is hands down the best pen for what I need. I will never be ordering
any other type of pen ever again! "
Markl,"November 14, 2017","These are my all time favorite pens. They almost never smudge and they are
extremely pigmented (although the ink has a tiny purple underhue which I think
just adds to the amount of things going for this pen). It writes extremely
smoothly and doesn’t smudge when highlighting"
hwagoner1,"November 7, 2018",Was hoping these would hold up to highlighters without smearing but nope.
Olive,"December 12, 2018","This is by far the best of the inks I’ve tried so far. The ink dries
incredibly fast and very smooth. My only complaint is that it can be scratchy as
with any fine-tip pen. For me, putting the ink in a saras grand body helped a
ton."

for a 0.4mm pen, which some may not like, but it's never been a problem for me
as the pigment is rich and skip-free. Highly recommend for note taking and quick
journaling. "

ellekay,"November 23, 2019","Obviously a staple in anyone’s pen arsenal. This size gets a little scratchy,

everyone needs one or two lying around."

about them I was curious about how it would perform. I ended up getting the dry
so I could use it in my hobonichi and after about 3 months of use I am
definitely a convert. It doesn’t dry immediately on the tomoe paper but it’s
such a dark black that I can be a little careful to use this pen. I was
previously using a uniball signo (the wide body clicker) and this does dry
faster on the paper. Besides the ink it’s an ergonomic pen so it’s easy to
write and control my writing. Weirdly, it does bleed on the paper but like very
minimally. It wasn’t enough for me to give up this pen. "

handed person, I can verify that the black line that has been a permanent
resident on my hand has disappeared, even during long note sessions over various
boring topics. The clip works great, and the only way I could get the ink to
smudge was to write and then immidieatly run the tip of my finger on it. So no,
this will not smudge in a day to day situation :) Overall, highly recommend."

closer to 0.7."
missink,"March 4, 2019","Just got mine today, wrote half a page as a test. Mine was not scratchy at all
and the ink flow is great. The line is thicker than the not-dry Zebra Sarasa 0.4

ballpoint, which is fast-drying to begin with. I can't quite believe how
fantastic it is."
cute but not a lot,"February 12, 2019","These are GREAT pens for lefties, and/or for people who color-code things and
need to highlight right after writing something down. (Both of which apply to
me!) I just wish they made the tips in smaller sizes--0.4 is a little on the
broad side for me in general, and these tend to write a fatter line than other
gel pens with the same tip size. If they made these in 0.3 or 0.28, I'd buy...a
lot. A lot of them. A capped option would be nice, too."
Britt,"January 18, 2019","It’s a smooth  writer and drys within 5 seconds or less on most paper. It

Rebekah,"March 31, 2018","I bought this pen for my left-handed husband. He isn't into pens nearly as much
as myself (I'm a fountain pen enthusiast). However, he loves this ink! He says
it never smears on normal paper and only slightly on slick receipt paper. He has
two small complaints: 1- It's scratchy... which should be easily remedied with
either a .5 or .7 refill. 2- I'm having a hard time finding him a nice metal pen
that fits the refills. I have a copper Karas Kustom Retrakt pen that he admires.
The refill fits inside, but doesn't quite engage the click mechanism. I'm going
to see if I can do some tinkering to make it work. If so, I'll be using this ink
in my Hobonichi Weeks rather than the Pilot G2 that constantly smears on me. All
in all, he's happier with this pen than any other he has tried. We have 3 other
left-handed family members who will soon receive a small ""just because we love
you"" gift. :)"

betolung,"December 10, 2016","Great choice for writing and sketching. The Pilot Juice Up 0.4 mm gel pens in
black and violet are both pretty comfortable and practical since they are
retractable. The clear top of the pen barrel displays a color band when the tip
is retracted. They are both reasonably smooth considering their small tip size.
They are refillable, for you can unscrew the entire color grip area from the pen
barrel.The gel ink is fairly waterproof and smudge resistant. After allowing it to dry,
the pen sketch can be smudged only slightly when rubbing the ink outlines with
light-colored watercolor brush pens. If you don't mind the effect of some light
gray washes, it is still possible to color a gel ink sketch with watercolors.Smaller than your average American fine point pen, this 0.4 mm tip size is
perfectly suited for tiny sketches and writing in small print. The ""synergy"" tip
grants you great precision while still feeling strong enough to withstand my
normal drawing pressure. "
banobana,"December 8, 2017","If you're attempting to upgrade from the original Pilot Juice, you might not
want to. Juice Up's ink is a tad bit lighter and thinner than the original 0.38
Pilot Juice pen. What I liked about the original was that the grip was really
close to the tip, which makes it easier for me since I hold pens a specific way
where my ring finger rubs super close to the tip. "
heathwang7,"February 15, 2017","I bought an orange Juice Up Pen along with this black one. For this pen (and not
the orange one) I tend to get skips every time I start drawing with it. Nothing
major, it tends to flow pretty well after one or two strokes, but if I leave it
unused for a period of time and start with it again, it can be an issue. I like
the design of the pen though, and once I get it going it's a real pleasure to
use. "
IEnjoyPens,"March 2, 2018","Many pens with such a small tip usually are a bit scratchy. This isn't. If you are searching for a smooth writing with a small thickness this is the pen

The only part that makes me want to bring the rating down is the end part
rattles SO MUCH. When the pen is clicked, the cutout for where the clip sits is
not snug enough to keep it from moving side to side. It's pretty distracting at
first but I got used to it after a while. I don't know how it will fair in in a

became my favorite. I had tried some 0.4 and 0.3 pens, but found them yo be too
scratchy or uneven. I was curious about the Pilot Juice-Up pens in 0.4 because
they were highly recommended by several people. So, I decided to give this pen a
try.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed writing with this pen. It has a
thin line, but it writes smoothly and without smudging or bleed-through. I
actually ended up using it as my go-to pen for my weekly memory-keeping journal
that is made from 5mm graph paper. The thinner lines work perfectly with it and
the color is a nice and pigmented black.The pen is comfortable to hold for longer writing sessions and the needle tip
makes it easy to see as I'm writing. Overall, I would recommend this pen and
I'll likely purchase more colors in the future."

muji. this pen surpassed my expectations. when i used it the first time, the ink
was pretty skippy and i didn’t like the way my handwriting looked. but after
using it for about a few months now, i really like it now. i find it very
practical to use for studying since the ink dries pretty fast and it’s good to
use with highlighters. it doesn’t smudge a lot too and it looks pretty classy
now that you look at it. the 0.4 nib is just nice for me since it’s not too
thick and not too thin. despite being 0.4, i like how the ink is still dark when
you write with it and it doesn’t look faded. i really like the pen. will
definitely be using it for my coming exams. p.s: buy the refills if it’s available in the local bookstores! it’s much
cheaper that way :) "

my pen and can't even write with anything else (not even signing a receipt at
the store, I'm strange, I know). So this was a big deal for me and a serious
hunt. I tried a few pens but have finally found one that I might even (gulp)
love more than my G-Knock. This pen is amazing...especially for a picky left
handed writer. My only complaint, and I've ordered a few more to see if it was
just that pen or if this is going to happen again, was that about half way

Ink Dragon,"October 14, 2019","These color are gorgeous. I was originally only going to buy a single blue-grey,
but I'm glad I got the entire set because it's a refreshing break from the
bright, not-quite-neon colors the majority of colored gel pens come in. The
colors are on the subdued side and they all go very well together. The pen
bodies themselves are attractive too."
Pseudonym,"June 14, 2022","I've had a Zebra Sarasa Clip pen (specifically 0.5 in black) in all my pen cases
since I started elementary school. I've tried what seems to be a million pens
throughout the years, and this is one of the few pens that I can't replace. I
love the Sarasa line, and this beautifully colored set is no exception.Before I critique these pens, I would like to mention two things. Firstly, I've
repurchased refills for my vintage Sarasa pens several times over many years,
but I only decided to write this review now. Secondly, I have used these pens on
a variety of papers. From thick to thin, from smooth to textured, colored, and
every kind of ruled paper. I'm basing this review on my overall experience with
what I noticed from using them on a variety of writing surfaces, but every pen
will work best with the surface it was made for. These pens have extremely smooth ink. It dries quickly and has no bleed-through
(almost no shadowing on thin paper). I have used many highlighters with these
pens, and I haven't noticed any smudging after letting the ink dry for a few
seconds. Promptly as I finish the sentence, they are dry enough to highlight. I
have never gotten any transferring or fading of the ink. The ink flows easily,
with no skipping. The amount of ink in these pens is incredible, especially for
the price. I write a lot, and I only need refills on the colors I use the most
once a year. The colors are gorgeous, easy on the eyes, and fairly unique.I have very few negatives with these pens. I love the design of the barrels, the
creme-colored clip with the muted colors, and the gold accents. But the grip
isn't the best. It's comfortable, though if you have a strong grip or write for
long periods of time: I would recommend purchasing more comfortable grips to put
on the pens or getting the refills and putting them in your favorite pen
barrels. I use the 0.5 tips, but I have purchased the 0.4 in the past and found
them slightly scratchy. Overall, these are some of my favorite pens. I love these colors for
note-taking, journaling, and everything in between. If you like the Sarasa line
and love these colors, I recommend purchasing them. If you have never used a
Zebra Sarasa pen before... beware: you might end up with every color they carry."

quivalasaynow,"September 26, 2019","All Zebra pens are always wonderful writing tools. I love lots of pens so I have
a variety of colors. These Vintage color pens have colors you don't see often. I
have only seen these by Zebra. I call them my ""harvest colors"" because I love
fall and like to write with these colors during this time of year, The price is
Great and you will be getting pens with a large supply of ink. Delivery was very
quick, also. "

Jorose,"July 8, 2020","I was a little disappointed at first because it felt a little scratchy and the
ink skipped a little and the tip size felt smaller than a 0.5. But after using
it for a while I got used to it and I do like the colors a lot. I probably won't
recommend this to others, but these are good pens I guess."

Anonymous,"December 8, 2021","It has been 6 months since I've ordered these pens, and honestly? These are the best pens I've ever used.I originally bought these pens after a friend gifted me some Zebra Sarasa Gel
Clip pens. I was intrigued by the color choices, and wanted to see if these pens
were just as good as the the Sarasa Gel Clip pens they gave me. These pens were
just as good, if not better. As someone who does a lot of writing, I like the way the ink flows from these
pens. It doesn't matter if I'm scribbling something in a quick cursive manner,
or printing letters to make them legible. This pen has managed to catch all of
my strokes, both fast and slow. It makes it really easy for me to write whenever
the need arises. I appreciate that they dry pretty fast too. Not to mention, I'm
actually still on my first pen set. I've written pretty consistently with these
pens, but they haven't run out of ink yet! That impressed me, as someone who
tens to use up the ink in pens pretty quickly. With the consistent ink flow, the
different colors, and the large ink storage, these pens have ended up being my
default pens. I've even shown these to my stationary friends, and convinced a
few of them to order a set for themselves once they got to try my pens for
themselves.That being said though, there are some things to be aware of when buying these
pens. The first is that they're gel pens. They dry pretty quickly, but they're
not instant. You do have to let the ink settle for a little bit, otherwise you
will get smudging and ink dots on blank paper. In addition, telling the
difference between the colors has to be done visually. One of the things that I
wish these pens had is some sort of other way to differentiate the different
colors besides relying on visual cues. I tend to do a lot of my writing in the
late evening, when it's dark, under a nightlight. I can't tell you how many
times I've accidentally grabbed a pen thinking it was one color, but it was a
different one. I'm glad that I have some different pen barrels for the Sarasa (I
bought them years ago), but without a label to tell the colors apart, it can be
pretty hard to tell.Overall, I love these pens. My favorites from this set is the Blue Gray and the
Red Black. I will get these pens again, and I highly recommend getting the
second Vintage set as well, since it has even more colors!"

Rena V,"November 11, 2021","These pens are surprisingly fabulous. They write smoothly and evenly, which I
love about Sarasa pens. I was intrigued by the ink colors, but wondered if they
would be as uniquely compelling as I hoped. They are! Really wonderful!"
jaze,"November 8, 2021","I bought both sets of the vintage colors because I have never tried to Sarasa
pen line and was really wanting some new, darker 0.5 ink colors. The colors are
nice but I personally don't particularly enjoy the writing experience as much as
I do with my tried and true Pentel energel, I find the tip to be more scratchy
and the ink less fluid and smooth, even though it is a conical tip. I still use
them and probably will end up repurchasing, at least until I find darker shades
in the energel line up, but I do wish the ink was smoother. (Additionally, I
really really enjoy the bodies of these pens and do prefer them to the energel
pen body!)"

ink, I was excited to try because the plastic rather than brass makes this the
more economical option. However, the plastic feel of the pen is not the best
feeling to hold and I find that pen tips seam to ""snag"" on the paper. I have
basically designated these pens to the back of my pen drawer and they will
probably rot there. "

are very poor quality paper. I bought a stack of index cards (not from jetpens)
and the paper quality was very poor- it was not the heavy duty kind. Many other
types of gel pens smudged on that paper but these didn't. The writing was crisp
and clean, it didn't drag at all either.  So if you are unlucky like me and find

RichKH,"December 2, 2016","I received my set a few days ago, and I've been using all of them, changing pens
each time I have to write. Overall, these are all great pens (admittedly most
are great, some just good) and I find myself writing neater simply because of
their fine lines!In regards to specific pens, I find the Uniball Signo RT1 0.28mm to write
smoother than the Zebra Sarasa 0.3mm, and the two Pilot FriXion pens (0.4mm and
0.5mm) have ink that is grey, rather than black.If I had to pick favourites, both Pilot Hi-Tec-C (Maica 0.4mm and Grip 0.4mm)
would be at the top; the two FriXion at the bottom (due to the ink.)  As for the
remaining pens... it's too tough to call!"
katherine,"October 24, 2017","for the most part, these were all decent gel pens~ however, i felt that a few of
them fell short in terms of standard & quality. the 0.28 uniball signo was just
too thin & skipped far more than it should have; the frixon erasable pens were
very light, and frankly it really turned me off of them. i sincerely enjoyed the
pentel energel 0.5, the uniball signo 0.38 and the pilot juice 0.38- which now
have a permanent place in my collection. if anything, i'd honestly just get
those three and forgo the rest of the pens."

mikes,"October 9, 2019","So many pens I haven't tried them all yet, looking to find a new favorite."
Sophie,"September 29, 2019","Mostly good pens. I'm surprised they are mostly 0.4 mm and under because JetPens
already has a thin gel sampler, why couldn't they make this one have more 0.5
and 0.7s?"
dawn,"September 26, 2019","It's an ok variety. I didn't put into consideration that half of them were cap
pens and not all were clicker pens. So that kinda sucked. But I did find a
favorite,  however all the other ones I didn't like are just around my house,
car and purse for when I might need a pen but, other wise I don't really use
them."
nataly.wickstrom,"September 11, 2019","The sampler is awesome! Lots of different brands, but i wish it had a larger
range of sizes, maybe add a .7 mm?"

ryan.j.sinclair,"January 6, 2019","Very happy with my decision to get the sampler pack to get a feel for what types
of pens are available, I purchased both the Ballpoint and the Gel Pen sampler,
and the variety was nice, and it helped me narrow down to my favorite pens, and
I am now able to order those pens individually in the future. "

daniel.perez,"November 1, 2018",Loved the Pen Sampler pack! Each of the pens had great feel and quality. 
azhirise,"October 26, 2018","Great selection of fun pens to try. I never would've tried so many if they had
not been put in the sampler set.  I think these are a good value and are a good
representative set of what's available. It was well worth the price."
mac8600av,"October 25, 2018",Great selection of pens.  Great way to figure out what I wanted.
laura.indick,"October 4, 2018","A pen sampler! What an amazing idea. This is definitely focused on extra-fine
pens (a lot of them are .38), so you'll like it if that's what you're into. I
really like it! It's such a fun way to try out a bunch of pens."
Aktharp11,"October 3, 2018",Loved being able to try so many different pens. A must for anyone!
dogma248,"September 13, 2018","Pens on this sampler were way too ultra fine. Liked the Pentel EnerGel-X, Pilot
Juice & Uniball Signo DX UM-151: waterproof and ink color nice and dark. "
jasmyne.harris,"September 10, 2018","Out of 10 pens, I can honestly say about 3 were worth it. Majority of the pens
in this bundle skipped and were unsatisfactory. I am not very happy with this
selection of gel pens. I was excited to receive them but now that I have them I
know I will not use majority of them. "

kpink6707,"June 20, 2018","I loved this sampler. I’m new to the pen world and love gel pens so this was
perfect for me. I liked all but three pens and that was better than I was
excepting. Great selection overall."
kimaking248,"June 8, 2018","I didn’t like the pens. I thought I was order bold pens.  The ink pens are too
sharp and will tear the paper."

sayhi2nay,"April 11, 2018","Love the idea of the sampler-but I needed to pay more attention to the tip size.
These were WAY too sharp-Im more of a .50 girl. I can't write with any of these
so I gave them all away."
elise12192,"April 7, 2018","I’m glad I bought this pack because it gave me a chance to sample a variety of
pens. However, I only really like 3 of the pens! Also it’s useful to note that
these pens are very fine: .28 to .50 tips. If you don’t like that, this
isn’t the pack for you."

spencerskelly,"March 31, 2018","This is the way to figure out which pen is for you. I wish there was a strictly

shelby lj,"May 29, 2017","This pen sampler is by far my favorite. I am constantly on the search for the
perfect black pen for notes and everyday lists, etc. I try to find that one
great black pen that also comes in a variety of colors for color-coding and
making notes look prettier to study. Out of this group, my absolute favorite was
the UniBall UM151, it is a 0.38mm and I will be ordering a variety of colors in
this pen because it writes so smoothly without feathering or skipping at all! It
also doesn't smear when I go back over to write something above! I love all of
these pens, but UniBall UM151 is the best in my opinion with the Pilot Juice pen
a close second. "
whiteymonster,"May 21, 2017","I love the fact that JetPens offers these sampler packs. I made a bad call
ordering this one, just because I'm less of a fine tipped pen person. The
largest tip in this sampler is a 05, so basically all the pens were useless to
me. But I got to try a whole assortment of pens I've never heard of or seen
before. I'm sure I will use them all at some point, but I didn't find the pen
for me, so to speak. If you like small tips, (the average size is 038) this is
definitely a great pack for you to try out!"
jason.shrontz,"April 25, 2017",Love the variety.
jessica.barr05,"April 21, 2017",Loved them all!
esquala,"April 18, 2017","Perfect for people who love to write and doodle and love pens. Bought this as a
gift for my teenage daughter.  She loved all of them, but especially the
erasable Frxon pens.  I found a new all-time favorite, the Pilot Maica - smooth
and fine, perfect for me.  The tiny gold Japanese letters on these pens is ultra
cool.  This is a great gift idea - useful and always the right size."
Memarge,"April 7, 2017","I like every product I have ever ordered from JetPens.  Their prices are fair
and their customer service is impeccable.  I will always buy product from them."
Rusty Shackleford,"March 19, 2017","A great set, but I don't feel like a wide enough range of line widths was
covered.  Many of the pens are too thin for rigorous note-taking, which is what
I bought them for, but they should be fine for more careful writing."
crerar532,"March 15, 2017","Gave it as a gift to a fine black point friend as she said it was the most
thoughtful gift ever.  Great way to check out a bunch of different pens.  That
being said, we both agree that Pilot G-Tec-C4 is the best of the bunch.  I buy
them by the box."
Cait,"March 2, 2017","I had been eyeing this sampler for at least a month when I finally decided to
treat myself. I should have bought it sooner!!!I am so picky with the pens I use and I love every single one of these. The tip
size, the shape - perfection... I'm not crazy about retractable pens and I loved
these too!I'm so glad I bought the sampler. I think I might have to try the blue black or
the purple one next..."

What a great way to find the pen you love."
anna.machavariani,"February 1, 2017","Amazing sample. I couldn't be more happier. it's really good variety. My
favorite so far is UNI-Ball signo 0.38. its perfect mix of thinness and bold
color. <3 "
judesurf,"November 30, 2016","This was an excellent way to sample some of the best pens on the market right
now. Of the 10 pens I received, 8 or 9 of them I could see using all day, any

pen."

dnetzler,"December 20, 2018","i wouldn't have bought a the pentel euro tip if it wasn't in the sampler but now
i've found that they are great pens. They write smooth and are comfortable. The 0.28mm is too scratchy for me... the Juice is ok nothing super special. The hi-tec c's duhhh great... a little scratchy but awesome...The UM-151- another DUHThe frixion another another DUH- although the needle point was a little of a let
down, very faint lines I would suggest this set if you haven't owned a HI-tec, or a frixion, or a UNI."
abjonespsyd,"December 22, 2016",Loved them all!
artist_40k,"March 16, 2012","If you are looking for the equivalent(and probably even better version) of the
High tech C try the Uni-Ball Signo DX 0.28mm or the zebra sarasa 0.3 mm. Both
are absolutely fantastic pens in all respects, and are even better because
they're cheaper than the high tech c. Both also come with a grip and do not have
a fragile needle point like the high tech c."
ssshadowcaster,"December 14, 2015","When I first heard about this pen, I though I would give a try.  Now, its my
main pen to use when I am working.  Really love the ink and the needle point.  I
also really like the simple plastic body, no frills, no flash, just a simple
casing to hold a great refill.  If you have not given this a try, the get one,
try it, then thank Jetpens for being a reliable vendor."
kabukigirl16,"May 19, 2017","Best pen I have ever used. Love the needlepoint tip and the ink quality.  Bit
pricey compared to some American pens but definitely worth the investment "

kathyl30,"January 6, 2011","This is my absolute favourite writing pen. Fast drying ink and very smooth use.
I've tried the thinner tip 0.3mm and it just doesn't compete with the 0.4 imo.
Only criticism I have for this line of pens is the fragile tip. It only takes 1
drop (landing on the tip) to permanently damage it to render it unusable. These
are also quite hard to find in my local stationery store and I am therefore
glad/thankful that jetpens seem to always have them available."
heidiheidi160,"January 11, 2022",Nice not to scratchy considering the size 
feneom,"December 11, 2022","I love how thin it writes, just sad how quickly the tip got damaged. It's thin
shape makes it more easy to bend on accident and that's what happened to me, and
now it sometimes skips which is frustrating. When it does write well the flow is
great. I just got unlucky and slightly damaged mine."

rehartman,"March 15, 2022","These Pilot Hi-Tec-C Gel pens 0.4 mm are the best writing pens I've ever used.
The finer ones (0,25 mm) clog and do not write smoothly. The 0.4 mm write
clearly until they are empty."
Sachicocoa,"March 7, 2022","I never thought how amazing this particular gel pen could be. It doesn't smudge
or smear and it dries instantly. It glides across the paper effortlessly and I
don't have to put much effort or pressure when writing with it. I originally got
this pen because the artist Heikala uses it in her daily sketches. I was never
able to get her art supply boxes when she was offering them on her website. That
being said I tried to find the items included in her art box with some
deviations on different places on the web. I didn't particularly need this pen
as I believe there are several others like it in my local art store, but for now
I'm glad that I bought this pen. It is very versatile for writing and sketching.
I highly recommend this pen."
lorirosea5,"January 28, 2022","I bought this for my left handed husband, he already had one he liked. But I
thought I'd get him something else to try. I think he liked it more than the
other I bought. He said the ink dries quickly and it writes well. "
erc,"January 15, 2022","I purchased three of these gel pens (.25mm, .3mm and .4mm) for pen and ink
drawing thinking they would be easier to carry than Sakura Microns. They work
very well to that end and allows drawing somewhat faster than microns; however,
this is ameliorated by the fact that the ink takes considerably longer to dry
before you can erase any pencil layouts. Despite that I like them."

Stabilo Boss highlighters, but I expected that since it's gel."
apocalypticAmerica,"September 2, 2021","If you're here you've probably heard the hype. These are kind of legendary. IMO, they live up to their name.  Basic, no-frills functionality. Doesn't skip

claxton.kk,"June 2, 2021","Love this pen for writing in small spaces - calendars, small spaces forms. The
black ink has become my husband’s preferred pen - I think the smaller tip
makes bad handwriting more legible than a wider one! Only problems are  sometimes the ink doesn’t flow well and we’ve had 2-3
pens that the tip bent on us (normal use) when there was still plenty of ink
left!"

gideoncoleis,"May 11, 2021","I like the design and how thin it writes, but I think that the feel is a bit of

Mandasmac,"March 11, 2021","My Mom is practically addicted to these pens for her crossword and other

oily consistency to their inks, and smudge too easily."

tiarasimmons7,"October 20, 2020","Great pen for drawing. I find that with some pens if you're unsure of the next
line you can sketch it out a little, almost like a pencil. That doesn't really
work with this pen, you have have to be absolutely sure of every line you put
down (which isn't a bad thing. it really builds confidence)."

luha700,"September 24, 2020","My favorite note-taking pens! Suuuper precise (makes a sligh, pleasant

dualedge,"October 17, 2018","I really, really love these pens. I've only used the 0.4mm so far (though a lot
of them.) They are great for writing, doodling and drawing. I deduct one star
for just one reason - the ink isn't waterproof so while they are awesome to draw
with, the fact that anything will make the ink smear (markers, water, ink,
spills, whatever) is definitely a downside. If that's not a concern for you, I
can't recommend these enough."
saraheisme,"October 13, 2018","This is, by far, the best stick pen on the market.  It's precise, smooth
writing, doesn't glob, and fits nicely in your hand.  They're inexpensive, and
come in a wide variety of colours.  I agree with other reviewers that have said
the 0.4 is the best tip width for consistent flow on a variety of papers.  I
found this pen on a closeout at a local retailer and bought all 30 they had on
hand.  I'm coming to the point now where I'll need to place an order for some,
and I'm so grateful that they're available on Jetpens.com!  Try this pen.  You
won't be disappointed!"

you bring the pen to a stop on a drawing."
donnahwynbrandt,"February 8, 2018","i found the pen good for printing and scripting letters of the alphabet, but
inadequate for drawing.drawing requires a good ink flow for very long lines, and the ink just wouldn't
cooperate.  Ink wouldn't adhere to paper beyond a few inches.  For lines going
around the perimeter of an 8 1/2 x 11"" sheet, for example, I had to reach for a
different penI like writing letters with this pen, but the ink is very light and the words
don't sufficiently stand out from the white background of the paper."

being low, the ink flow does not change and work as great as when new. "
Ceme,"April 20, 2017","I got this free with a large purchase, the tip is so thin I'm afraid if I press
down too hard it will break. This is a way smaller than my 0.38 mm tips (or so
it feels).  Glad I did not purchase this outright, but grateful JetPens grants
offers with purchases."

this is a wonderful pen for writing, sketching, doodling.  Feels comfortable in
your hands.  It's very smooth and precise. I very much recommend it."
clouruth,"December 23, 2014","The Hi Tec C is my very favorite pen!  I bought several and gave them to my
friends for Christmas, so you may be receiving orders from new people. It was
hard for me to give some away. I'm very possessive with my pens and usually
don't like to share them. I love the sharp point making it easy to fill in small
spaces on forms and even as much as I write with them, they last a long time. I
think they are by far the best pen on the market for the money!! "

malves 000,"March 12, 2014","Amazing pen to draw and write.  I love everything about it.  Lots of ink, super
black ink, no fading, it's light and comfortable, no ink blob at the tip.  It
looks great, too."
Gcyn09,"June 5, 2011","This pen is the smoothest pen I've bought from Jetpens by far, and the textured
grip isn't so bad! I will definitely restock when I run out of ink! :D "
lisaakoo,"May 25, 2011","Hands down the best pen for writing. period.0.4 works the best. I usually wirte in script and htis pen is perfect for it.
too bad its kind of expensive...... ;("
geminica,"August 18, 2010","These pens are great. I prefer the .4mm to the .3mm because the line is smoother
and works well on a greater variety of papers. I find it to be much more
reliable and smooth than Microns, however Microns are totally waterproof and I
wouldn't recommend these for use with wet media unless you're looking for a
water-soluble ink effect."
hartzog2000,"August 28, 2008","I like this series of gel pens. I have all 4 nib sizes. The nib, some say, is
fragile but I don't believe that is the case, at least not in my experience. I
don't have to press hard to get them to make a mark so I am less likely to break
the nibs than someone with a heavy hand. If you treat these pens right they
perform just fine. The 0.25mm nib of course makes the finest line and the 0.5mm the widest.
However, and it should come as no surprise, the smaller the nib the ""rougher""
the pen feels when writing with it. However the nibs being smaller in diameter
than other pens their nib size they make for excellent drafting/drawing pens
when you use a straight edge such as a triangle or ruler. Again one does not
have to press hard to get these pens to produce a line. The ink in these pens is dark and the pens write without skipping or the ink
running out unevenly. The ink supply is typical of such pens, maybe a tad more
generous. The clear plastic barrels have a ribbed surface for grasping near the
nib. The are as comfortable as any plastic barreled pen or pencil. The only
thing that could make these pens any better is to make the retractable."
jealyencho,"June 25, 2008","wonderful pen, however jetpen's version does not have the rubber grip.(It should have one)"
monteith22,"February 27, 2007","The Pilot Hi-Tec-C 0.40mm pens have to be one of the world's greatest writing
instruments. Pilot has provided an incrediably reliable fine point, with an ink
composition that is unlike anything else I have used. I originally purchased my
first two pens while traveling in Japan, and became discouraged that I could not
find them in the US - wherever I went where they were sold, I alway had to stock
up. Now with JetPens selling them we have the best of all circumstances! I don't
think that I have dealt with an on-line store that is anywhere near as good to
deal with. If you are a first time customer, you are in for a treat with
JetPens!"
cynwebb,"January 18, 2007","I love my Hi-Tec-C pens. In order to get them I used to have my officemate order
them from her dad since he went to Japan on business once a year. I was starting
to run out of ink in my last pen and was dreading the day. I'm so excited that I
found Jet Pen. Now I won't be a pen Natzi with my friends when they want to use
one. I hope you guys stay around for awhile. The discovery of your site has made
my year!"
malavshah1,"July 7, 2006","Thank you! I've been waiting forever for an American retailer to carry these. I
discovered these pens while traveling through Europe about 6 years ago. I tried
to buy them in the US and even contacted Pilot about why they didn't sell these
in the US, Pilot replied because of patent law issues. Its nice to know their finally available instead of buying them all the way
across the world. Hope Jetpens is around for awhile. I'll be buying again!"
redge1980,"May 8, 2005","Being a med student I'm pretty demanding about notetaking and these pens are the
absolute best. I've been using them ever since high school, but since they
aren't readily available in the US would either have to wait for friends to
bring them back from Japan or go to JapanTown in San Francisco for them. They
write amazingly well with crisp thin lines, no smudging, and no bleeding through
pages. Use these pens once and you'll be hooked."
ladewski,"April 2, 2005","These pens are the best! So precise, and with so many ink colors. Thank you!!!"
jetpens,"March 10, 2005","It is certainly a great pen, I can see why these are all the rage. Too thin and
precise for my taste, however."
rkapoor,"February 26, 2005","Wow! These pens are just so good to write with. I tried one two years ago and
have since been searching for a nice retailer where I could get them easily and
in so many colors."
polylover,"February 24, 2005","My favorite out of the 4 sizes so far. These pens are quite durable, as long as
you don't have a heavy hand. I'm a delivery driver and made the mistake of
taking this pen with me on deliveries one night for customer signatures and one
of them bent the tip! They're used to big bulky pens I guess. Try it out. It
gives a nice crisp, clean, consistant line and it dries pretty quickly. They
work great with prisma color markers."
jessicamartinezlvn,"January 7, 2022",Not a fan but still great quality. 
debo1004,"July 1, 2011","This is the most amazing pen I've ever written with. I bought the 0.4mm and
0.28mm sizes a while back, and they've surely grown on me. Unlike other pens
that I've used, and lost, this is one that I must have on me at all times. The
tip is so fine, and the ink is perfect... Every stroke it totally smooth. No
smudges, no nicks or skips or anything. Even my coworkers have tried to pocket
this gem for themselves! "
Juniper,"October 5, 2022","First of all: these colors are lovely and the pens are quality. But I have to
admit I'm a little surprised that not all the colors are actually new. I did not
realise it at the time, but the ""neutral"" color set is a variation of the
previously released ""natural"" color set, with the dusty pink color swapped out
for copper. My bad! Since I cannot find Mild Copper sold on it's own, I will
keep this set, but I advise anyone looking for a complete color set to skip the
""natural"" set and buy this one + Mild Dusty Pink individually."

favorite colors! Highly recommend the neutral color set :)"
aerwin23,"November 19, 2022","This Neutral set is sublime! My highlighter collection contains more summery and
brighter tones. I wanted to balance my colors with additional neutral or darker
tones. This Mildliner set is perfect for such an occasion! Each milder color
truly lives up to its name and I am so glad this set was restocked. "
d,"October 2, 2019","Exactly what I wanted - these pens have really helped streamline my bullet
journaling. Plus they're fun to doodle with. My only minor complaint is that a few of the colors have gotten a bit leaky in
the cap. Other than that, I love these and will definitely be replacing colors as I use
them up. "
Jimmysquarefoot101,"October 11, 2019","Oh I love these better than the tomboy play color dots.   Cleaner on the dots
and you can never make a bad circle.  Even like the colors. Like the zig clean brush pens you get a nice wet look and
the colors aren’t cheap looking.  "
Energygal25,"January 10, 2020","I wish I could draw and make the cute designs I see in all the pictures shared
with these markers, I can do some of them, but my biggest pet peeve is how the
bleed onto the other side of the page, whether it be cardstock or standard print
paper. Great colors overall!"
reidleelynn,"December 31, 2019","Super fun to use, gorgeous colors, and works well with the Hobonichi Techo
planner I also purchased."
Disco Gina,"October 10, 2019","I lost my words except my heart is popping out for the cuteness of these dot
pens!I'm an OG marker hoarder, and still have my dottariffic pens which work like new
to this day! So many jazzeries for the new style! It's true what another
reviewer mentioned about the dot tip being somewhat firm-ish. The updated
markers are not as squishy as the dottariffics. Perhaps they get softer over
time & use?Regardless, there is no place that doesn't need polka dots! Thank you JP team!
Another superior purchase. =) "
Beau,"December 30, 2019","These markers are great, and the colors are very vibrant! I especially enjoy the
colors Summer Sun, Fawn, and Kiwi. The dot marker is capable of producing a diverse size of dots. This marker can
also be used for brush calligraphy and has a nice gradient when doing down
strokes. I look forward to using these as a substitute for my brush pens. "
marlayna75,"January 26, 2020","Very nice dots small or large. Perfect for bullet journaling. The thing point in
the other end writes beautifully too. Wow what a great combo for journaling. "
Tansy,"December 27, 2019","This seems at first glance to be a gimmick but my life is definitely better with
these pens. It's hard to describe how fun and satisfying it is to bounce the
round end and cover a piece of paper with a rainbow of perfect dots. I use all
12 colors in the Gantt chart (habit tracker) in my planner (Kokuyo Jibun Techo),
so they're useful for me as well."
cmatsusaka,"July 3, 2021","Markers are perfect for doodle journaling and highlighting.  Fairly ""juicy"" pens

sk8rcruz,"April 20, 2021","I’m very happy with the variety of ways to use these pens. I’ve made flower
motifs, polka dot stationery decorations, and bullet points in my journaling.
They are subtle colors that do not take over the whole page. I look forward to
getting more color sets as they become available."
christim88,"April 15, 2021",Not bad but the pens leak with the cap on. 
IndiGloGurl,"April 13, 2021",Cute little marker set! Love making all the dots and whatnot.
ccabot,"August 19, 2020","I absolutely love these pens.  I purchased these after some hesitation due to
the price but am glad I did! I wasn't sure that the dot point functionality
would be that different than what can be achieved with the fine end of the
Mildliner but the results are much better. The dot end is easy to use with fantastic results and I love the fine point end
for writing and underlining.  The fine point end is finer and firmer than that
of the Mildliner and I find it much more useful. I have a MaskeLife planner and
use the dots to categorize tasks and goals that the MakseLife color coding
system uses."
jfmdesigns,"December 26, 2019",Love these markers! Great for perfect polka dots!
lunabee34,"January 17, 2023","I bought these as gifts for the children of some friends.  They were a hit, but
I knew they would be since I love them myself.  Great color choices and lots of
fun for budding artists to play around with the dot side of the markers."
Jake,"January 9, 2023","The color on these are vibrant and warm. I highly recommend these if you are in
need of a versatile marker. It has a precise bullet like tip on one end and a
squishy rounded tip on the other end. I use this for marking habit trackers or
with the washi circle tape to keep track of a quick visual aid and these are
wonderful. I love the variety here and if you wanting to add some color to your
planner or journals this is the way to go. These are very much worth it. They
just feel good in the hand and the dots go down write where you place them and
are nice and clean and dry quick. "
zero.s,"January 6, 2023","Really great set of colors; I use it to color code specific tasks in my monthly
planner. I would recommend trying these dot markers on a sheet of scrap paper
first so you can get a feel of how much pressure is needed to make your
preferred bullet point diameters.  "

Zebra mildliners."
Shefali,"August 28, 2022","I don't know how to explain it, but these are soo much fun to use. All my lists

they are really quite functional. As for the delivery, it was quite fast! I didn’t have to wait for too long.
Definitely a good experience for my first order. Will definitely order again
from JetPens! Thank you! <3 "
julief,"November 12, 2021","These are so cool. They're really fun to make pointillist-style drawings. But
what I really love doing with them is laying out scenes in novels, and marking
different characters with different colored dots, so I can easily see if there
are many scenes in a row where a character doesn't show up. (I know there are
digital ways to do this, especially because I use Scrivener, but sometimes it's
helpful to lay a novel out using old-school analog methods.) "

the markers was larger than I expected but no biggie. Even the marker end is
nice. Wish there were more themed sets out there, like a basic colors set, a
gray scale set, maybe some jewel tones but if not, I'm still very happy to have
these. Can see myself using them quite often.   "
Lexa731,"September 25, 2020","I bought these specifically to make some halftone patterned backgrounds, they
work amazing! the largest circle you can make fits perfectly inside of a grid or
bullet journal. The colors are translucent and dry down to a really pretty
matte-like finish. You can make really nice swooshes or flower patterns with the
dot end as well. The fine liner end is really great too, the tip is closest to a
Uni Emott pen with a plastic nib, but longer. It is really satisfying to write
with. A MUST HAVE for anyone who loves to decorate their bullet journals! 10/10
would buy again"
dixona45,"September 18, 2020","These had been on my wish list for a while and I am so happy I finally decided
to take the plunge and order them! I absolutely love them, they make my color

they work and I hope that they stick around! "

them on my desk.TBH, for me the dots are mostly a novelty, but anytime I get the chance to use
them I smile.  Where I really think these shine and became an everyday use item for me is the
super-fine point markers. Perfect for planners or bulllet journaling with colors without having to give up
neatness (or learn how to write fancy with brush-tip pens), and can easily be
used for actual writing when taking notes or outlining, not just for
decorations! "

oceanrising,"June 15, 2018","Just buy it. No disappointments here. Add an ink bottle or two or cartridges and
you are all set for a nice improvement to your handwriting. For way under under
$20 you get: - a quality fountain pen that has- a really smooth medium italic nib (!) inside a - aluminum body plus cap and in addition, you get- a squeeze converter. This nib is by no means inferior to the Lamy 1.1, TWSBI stub or Kaweco 1.1. I
like them all and the Pilot nib was a welcome addition. The nice hard case is a
bonus but it never leaves the storage box. I no longer doubt the merits of the Metropolitan. Highly recommended! "
mark_w_hardy,"June 3, 2017","I own numerous fountain pens, as well as, ballpoint and rollerball pens.  My
collection of fountain pens range from under $50 to well into the thousands.  I
have found Pilot to make pens that write well with a consistent ink flow that
rivals some of my more expensive fountain pens.  I also like having the ability
to write with an italic nib which many manufacturers fail to offer.  Thanks
Pilot for making a pen that anyone can afford and enjoy using on a regular
basis."
Josephskppr,"May 30, 2018","I'm crazy about the Italic nib pens, and for that reason love this pen. Like the
fact to that this pen is quite heavy and sturdy in design. I highly recommend
this pen. Has become my favorite by far."
Ceme,"April 20, 2017","This is a beauty and the nib is a broad to 1.1 in size.  What I don't like, the
nib is a bit on the scratchy side.  I'm hoping that will change with time. Like
most oblique or italic or stub nibs you have to hold them just right on the
paper, but they should not be scratchy.  Since this is an inexpensive pen, I was
not expecting it to write like a vintage Esterbrook or Parker, but its a little
on the scratchy side.  Good for work desk duty and its looks nice."
kimberly_navarro,"July 14, 2018","This pen is absolutely perfect for what I need it for. I preferred the Italic
nib to the rounded nib to give my writing a little extra flair and it did just
that. It has a great weight and feel as well."
heknits,"August 23, 2017","Hard to beat a Pilot Metropolitan.  This is my everyday work pen (I swapped in a
fine nib for work).  It's inexpensive enough that I won't beat myself up if I
lose it (which I sometimes do with pens), but it writes and feels like it should
cost more.  I saw the Metropolitan on a bunch of ""best pen"" lists and now I
understand why."
ads1,"May 30, 2017","Excellent pen. Good ink flow (cartridge). Excellent weight. Good size. Nib
smooth and no real complaint. The step down from the body to the section is
abrupt and although the section is fairly long I find the step ""in the way"" as I
need to back up the pen a bit since the nib is small - a 5mm perhaps. Unlike the
Kakuno and the Prera, the Metro cannot be held just anywhere.  The edge of the
body where it connects to the chromed piece that is the fixture that holds the
cap is sharp. If I slide down the section, the short nib has me dragging the
bottom fingers on the paper. My hands are large but not really, really large.
Smaller hands wouldn't have this problem, I think.It is a very nice pen, and flawlessly finished.JetPens service remains excellent!"
Cupcake,"May 17, 2019","I have owned several Pilot Metropolitans.  This is absolutely my go-to pen for
carrying with me.  If you are looking for your first fountain pen or just a pen
to use a lot then this is the one.  I highly recommend the italic nib versions. 
Any nib that is not italic is still going to be a fountain pen and will still
allow you to use any ink that you want but going with an italic nib will give
your writing a beautiful flair instantly.  The only downside to these is that
the squeeze-type ink converter that comes with these kind of sucks.  So I highly
recommend picking up a CON-40 converter to go with your metropolitan.  The
CON-40 is a perfect fit and works perfectly and finishes off the pen into the
most perfect daily carry pen you can have.  And the metropolitan is affordable
enough that you don't have to worry about losing it, dropping it, or anything
else.  I have lost several of these and was always bummed to lose such a nice
pen but they are so affordable that it takes nothing to just get a new one with
a new CON-40 converter and losing one is a good excuse to get a new one and
change up the color."
SteveL7874949,"April 20, 2017","The ""new"" italic nib should come in sizes larger still (up to 1.9 mm). The 1.0
mm is a little small.It beats the medium nib by a long shot. Pilot nibs are hard to come by.They should sell them as a ""separate"" purchase. It would be nice.Even untipped; the MP is still pretty smooth and way better than a medium. More
fun...more versatility. Great price !"
Kaede,"September 24, 2020","I picked this pen up because I needed essentially a workhorse pen that would be
reliably filled with black ink. This guy...is really elegant. I'm surprised. Out
of the Metropolitans that carry the CM nib on JetPens, you're basically given
the choice of either this one, or one of the Retro Pop selection. This pen,
although it seems as though it would be really plain -- it's beautiful in a
""classic"" sort of sense, especially when uncapped. It also writes as smoothly as
the Prera CM which preceded it."
mjmannis,"March 13, 2018","I am a frequent customer at JetPens and love your service.  The Pilot
Metropolitan is a bit of a disappointment.  It writes beautifully, but the nib
came completely  off right out of the box.  I put it back and it seems to be
working OK but either I got a defective produce or it is just poorly made. 
Since it is working, I am not returning it, but for durability, I give it a low
rating."
rwinniepilot,"October 24, 2022",Pen works well with a great price.
nick andrws,"October 12, 2022","The nib is scratchy and hard to write with. I love the Metropolitan, and I have
three of them. Two fine and one medium nib, and they all write amazingly. I
bought this one because I wanted to try out an italic nib, and I was
disappointed. It was really scratchy and unpleasant to write with. It felt like
the nib was resisting all my movements, making my handwriting look worse than
usual. Maybe that's par for the course with italic nibs, since there's no
tipping material, but it was still very disappointing to use. This is now
relegated to the pen cup and the Fine Metropolitan remains my daily driver."
evi2600l,"October 4, 2022","Writes great, durable and just PERFECT in its weight (btw I post the cap). ofc

jcfox1797,"August 29, 2022","The Pilot Metropolitan is a great fountain pen to start out with. This pen is a

cleaned out once, that's all, and has never failed to work (except for that one
instance when I forgot to put a new cartridge in it...).  Just using it for
plain handwriting creates a very easy to read and very easy to understand
document - literally this nib is just the right size for both Calligriphy and
for plain note taking.  As I said, I have had zero - as in none - difficulties
using it and even living nib-up in a shirt pocket, it has always written when I
needed it to do so.  I wish all my other fountain pens were this reliable...  
Anyway, Pilot is my brand from now on, solid, useful, and dependable."
foxdenfarms7,"April 22, 2022","Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this pen. For the price you can’t
go wrong. "
ruizjacob407,"March 26, 2022","Really elegant look and feel. Nice weight and size. Worth every penny. Also, the
squeeze  converter holds more ink than regular converters do, so another bonus."
ali42,"March 23, 2022","Pilot Metropolitan pens are my favorites. They write smoothly and are
dependable. I am happy with any nib size so far, from fine to medium italic.
Thank you JetPens for the selection and expertise."
kardeslivres,"March 23, 2022","I love this pen!  It's not an oblique nib, but the italic nib is the next best
thing."
jay.reimer,"December 10, 2019","I originally got this fountain pen because I was doing a lot of grading (I
teach) in which I write a huge amount of narrative comments. I decided if I had
to do all that writing then I would get a nice pen! I timidly got the plastic
version, which have nice nibs too (same I think). I bought one so i could keep
red ink in it and another for black or blue. I bought several more and gave them
away as gifts to students. I enjoyed them so much that I went ahead and bought
this ""fancy"" version. I loved it and it accompanied me everywhwere doing all my
writing (except addressing envelopes since that is exposed to moisture
sometimes). But ... I lost my first pen after over a year of beloved use. The nib is very
slightly scratchy, but the italic aspect produces such beautiful writing. One of my students saw my notebook (black ink) and looking at the text he asked
repeatedly, ""That is writing? It looks like it was printed!"" and he bent closer
to examine the text.So I had to buy another one - which I was happy to do because it produces such a
gorgeous product! "
trfarmer60,"October 22, 2019","Very quick delivery which surprised me.I like this pen very much and can't get over how well it works and the quality
it displays at this low price point.It took me several years and owning a number of a few high priced and medium
priced fountain pens to realize that I really prefer an italic nib. This is a
very good buy. "
livelyraven,"July 15, 2019","I LOVE this pen. I’m a fountain pen only person. Sooo smooth. Best pen out

avrambaer,"November 20, 2018","Nice bead, but it doesn't always flow freely."
vrios003,"October 8, 2018",The italic nib combines with my messy half-cursive handwriting really well
cowboyunderwater,"September 13, 2018","I am using a pilot metropolitan with the medium italic nib, and Noodlers Air
Corp Blue-Black ink for daily writing.  This combination is excellent. I can write on printer paper, engineering paper,
and cheap notebook paper without issue. this combo also works for writing on
receipts and other more waxy papers. The results on higher end paper are
beautiful.   10/10 would buy again."
Kwaiden11,"August 3, 2018",I love this pen. It's a lot easier to use than a flex nib. 
javierkehinde,"July 10, 2018","The Pilot Metropolitan with a medium italic nib is a very smooth wet writer.

hornbta,"December 15, 2017",Smooth writer - can't be beat for the price.
klon,"December 12, 2017","Just love writing with smooth-writing pens. The Italic nib requires a little
getting used to for ""newbys"" but the change in the finished product is cool.
(Just dated myself, didn't I?) I have two other same-style pens with regular
nibs. Also love them. They all make me feel that what I have to write is
valuable. "
jamestrueworthy,"July 24, 2017",Nice Pen. I Wonder When They Will come Out With 1.5mm nibs.
medievalist,"July 21, 2017","This is my first Italic nib, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I wanted it to use
for paleography practice, but I noticed immediately that it's just a pleasure to
use as a daily pen, particularly if, like me, you print more often than you use
cursive. I picked the Pilot Metropolitan Medium Italic nib after seeking advice
from Jet.pens staff, and the entire process couldn't have been easier or more
pleasant, though now, I'm looking at buying a Metropolitan Fine or Medium as
well . . .  "
Zoey,"April 15, 2017","Writes smoothly right out of the box.  Ink pools a tiny bit if you pause too
long during strokes and at outset of forming letters.  I am used to fine point
tips (e.g. .04) so took took a little getting used to.  Best for wide ruled
paper so you can see line variations.  A perfect addition to the Metropolitan
line :)"
erictloberg,"December 30, 2022","One of the best bang for the buck fountain pens. Italic nib is excellent and now
my favorite."
pen newbie,"February 1, 2022","A fine quality pen, and great for making headings in a notebook, but it's a bit
chunky for regular journaling unless your handwriting is large."
mistrcrvr,"December 15, 2021","Great starter pen….because I’m just starting. I can’t give much of a
review but - It is easy to refill, doesn’t leak, even on a pressurized airline
flight, and writes very well. This is a Medium nib and I think I’m going to
try a Fine one just to see the difference. Since I grip a pen higher up the body
than most, the screw-in link between the nib holder and the ink cartridge cover
is a little in the way. I don’t know how to get around this if I’m ordering
pens online so I think my investments will have to be made in person from now
on. And finally, if you’re curious, in a legal-sized lined notebook, the
cartridge lasted 13 pages. The pages are Filled from top to bottom. I thought
that was pretty good coverage. "
glstrcowboy,"November 18, 2021",Very nice pen. 
BKaye,"September 20, 2021","Such a great quality pen! I’m new to fountain pens so this was my first nice
pen. I bought one for myself and one for my friend. Writes smoothly whilst other
pens would skip a lot on the same paper. Good weight to the body and I love the
all metal exterior body, that doesn't have a scratch after I tossed it in my
pencil case and went on car rides hours long and dropping it. such a classy gift
you can’t go wrong."

metropolitans as well "
kmackellerann,"June 8, 2021","Easy to use and nice looking.  I have the 1.1 stub nib and it works flawlessly. 
There is no drag when I write and it has yet to fail to perform (something
fountain pens tend to do if you write too fast).  All in all, it's my new carry
pen and will be for the foreseeable future."
g_teran,"May 29, 2021",My favorite fountain pen so far.  Love the medium nib.

delivered.  The nib writes very smoothly and is helping me write beautifully

slbradley,"April 15, 2021","It's a Pilot Metro. Hard to go wrong. The only issue I have is that the nib is a
bit sharp and likes to snag on anything less than top notch paper."

jason.shriver75,"January 9, 2020","For the price point, as a beginner with fountain pens, this pen is absolutely
amazing out of the box. I am guy with large hands, and the pen is very nicely
balanced when posted. Uncapped it isn't too bad either, which may be good for
folks with smaller hands.I bought this <CM> pen to help me see a bit of thick/thin line flair with
cursive, which I haven't been able to do with typical <M> pens. It is very
pleasing to write with this pen as a beginner.When I opened the box I was so eager to write I simply installed the included
cartridge, squeezed it a few times, came back about an hour later and began
writing smoothly.Satisfied customer here - looking forward to exploring some of the other pen
styles / manufacturers later in 2020!"

buy one, I suppose. Nice weight, smooth flow."
rmaseles,"May 15, 2019","Finally, the fountain pen that works for me! The italic nib is perfect, the ink
flow is, um, perfect, and my handwriting is as good as it's ever going to get.
I've had Mont Blancs, Watermans, and several other high-end and other pens, and
this is my new favorite. The body has a silky feel that would be appropriate on
a much more expensive pen. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
peteschug,"April 26, 2019","I’ve only used it a short time but I like it. I tried to fill the bladder but
maybe I was afraid to immerse the pen deeply enough. It wrote very nicely when
dipped so I pulled out the bladder mech and stuck the ink cartridge in. Many
years ago I had a pelican and it was probably better than this but way more
expensive. This is as nice as any pen I’ve had and the price is quite low."
elensil,"April 12, 2019","This was my first fountain pen, and I couldn't be happier.  Pen is a reliable
writer, never had a hard start issue.  Nib is on a dry side, which is perfect

not worry."

assortment of really nice fountain pens, a Mont Blanc 149, an ST Dupont, a
couple Pilot's, a Waterman Expert, and a Lamy.  I am now using this Metropolitan
with the Italic nib for everything.  Works great on fountain pen friendly paper.
 Only down side is needing to wipe the nib and clean the cap.  All is all, just
a wonderful pen."
katiepeterson1991,"May 7, 2022","It's a Kaweco Sport. They're all adorable and usually great writers. This one is
just such a great color."
write2judie,"May 2, 2022","I have several fountain pens and this is by far my favorite. I bought it because
of the iridescent color. But it's far more than just a pretty pen. It's
lightweight and perfectly balanced. And the nib writes more smoothly than any of
my pens. I even checked once to make sure I was writing with a fountain pen and
not a rollerball! "
nesquik,"April 20, 2022","this pen is soo beautiful! i haven't used other plastic kawecos, but this one
feels light, yet sturdy. it seems a little thicker than a regular western medium
nib, but i'm using the pilot iroshizuku kon-peki ink with it which already runs
pretty wet, so i can't tell if its the nib or the ink. it doesn't bother be at
all, but figured it was worth mentioning!"
lakidaa,"January 10, 2023","This is actually my second one; I lost the original at work. :(. This pen is a delight. The Kaweco Sports are great. I love the length of it
closed (pocketable) and open with the lid on (just long enough). It's got some
weight, but it doesn't feel 'artificially' heavy. The nib I got is perfectly
fine for me. Jet Pen's example pages are true to life. Trust them. The color is a little less shiny in real life, and a little more... pearlescent.
I know. I almost wish the colors were stronger? But it's a distinct, fun pen. "
KatK,"December 4, 2022","As always, I find Kaweco pens to be solid and reliable. This is not quite as
iridescent as I hoped it would be, although definitely pearly. Quietly pretty
pen. I consider the color to be an amped-up neutral."
HLYP,"May 11, 2022","Bought this as a first foray into Kaweco pens. Couldn’t resist the color -
truly unique. I like that it’s translucent so you can see ink levels. Pen is super light and easy to write with. Compared to my Sailor Pro Gears, the
Kaweco Medium steel nib is definitely thicker than a Sailor medium, and the
Kaweco has a smaller sweet spot for writing angle. It means it sometimes skips
if my hand shifts ever so slightly out of position. That I find slightly
annoying but otherwise the pen is priced much lower than a 14k Sailor and you
get what you pay for. I think it’s a fun pen to own and makes me smile to
write with it"

Kate,"June 19, 2022","I really like this pen. I have it in the medium and fine. I didn't expect a huge
difference between the Kaweco medium and fine nibs, based on the reviews and
writing samples I'd seen. This one writes more like a broad, from the look of
it. It's quite wet, but not wet enough to be a problem. The nib looks perfect,
and it writes smoothly. I'm curious to try this with ink that's good for
shading. I think it might do really well with that. "
stephanie.altrui,"June 16, 2022","Very pretty color. Got the M nib because I have heard Kaweco nibs aren’t too
consistent. This one isn’t a very smooth writer, but it’s not too bad :) "
scientificmouse,"June 13, 2022","The ink just won’t flow consistently, leaving me scratching at the paper. I
wanted to love this as it’s my first major fountain pen, but honestly the
Pilot Kakuno writes like a dream compared to this pen. Maybe it will work better
with the converter."

highly recommend this pen!"
milkapiszczek,"October 11, 2011","Great pen! Smooth, dark, and fast drying ink (yay! I always manage to smear what
I'm writing with most other pens). It's also super thin without being scratchy,
which I appreciate. The grip was a bit greasy when I received it but the feeling
wore off in a few days. Only wish it was a bit heavier, but I don't mind the
weight too much. I want more colors!"
indigocornflower,"August 15, 2011","I got the 0.35mm in black, and I love it! It's super smooth, black, and writes

masher023,"July 3, 2018","I bought the pen in a hope i could find i smooth writing experience with a
smaller tip size, this was not the case the ink is nice and i would recommend
the ink refills in another pen. However the pen itself was quite underwhelming,
its weird tip and awkward grip makes for an unpleasant writing experience."
klog,"January 16, 2018","I ordered four of these pens. Three were great. They wrote well. Slightly
scratchy but nice ink administration, very consistent. The fourth was very
scratchy and did not produce ink reliably. I had to throw it out a day after
purchasing it."
nateboards,"February 2, 2017","Super smooth, despite the 0.35mm tip. The ink is a rich, dark black, it's got a
nice rubber grip, stylish body... what's not to love? My favorite fine-tip gel
pen."
jimmy jo jim Bob,"November 12, 2016","I used up the one I had and quickly ordered another. This pen is excellent when
you need a super fine point to write in smaller spaces. It flows equally well

the ink dry out on the tip or in the pen. It's also very comfortable with a
rubber grip. It's minamilst perfection!"

they don't make more colors."
jenniferisabella,"April 25, 2016","I purchased this after a Jet Pens recommendation (someone was gracious enough to
read and respond to my list of requitements for a new pen). This is my new

over 50 pages of notes with this pen and couldn't be happier. Thank you, Jet
Pens!"
SusieQ,"April 19, 2016","surprisingly for .35 a very nice pen, smooth gliding pen."
william,"October 18, 2015","Writing with then pen is very nice, and I especially like the grip; however it
does have its downfalls, which other people may disagree with.The pen feels slightly cheap, and the needle-point gives a rougher feeling than
a conical would.These are all fairly minute complaints, and my main concern was that it
occasionally slipped. This would happen anytime I wrote faster than normal or at
a slightly lower angle. The pen's lines are very bold and dark (and actually fairly wide) considering
the small point.I compared this pen to the uni signo UM-151 0.38, which did many of the things
mentioned above better, in my opinion, at the same price.This is not to say that I would not recommend this pen to anyone, as I still
enjoy using it very much."
Griff,"May 25, 2015","I'm not convinced with ""sevgar's"" contention that the retractable refills have
an internal spring that pushes the ball up inside the tip when not in use blah
blah. The little I know of tip engineering makes me dubious of this claim. The real proof, though, that the refills on these Euros is he same as the RTX,
is that you CAN compare the refills in the Euros  vs. the knocking RTX ones: the retractable energel needle-tip, the ""Deluxe RTX Retractable,"" has the LRN1
refill inside, right out of the package. The Energel Tradio pen, a capped pen, similar to the Euro, has the LRN1 refill
right inside as well! This pen is marketed as the SAME pen as the ""Euro"" pen,
but with an upmarket pearlescentbody color. Plus it can open so you can replace
the refills. So, voila. The refills are the same across the energel range. So, ya - SAME REFILL in both. I leave my caps off all the time and have no
problems. And obviously no problems with the RTX. My next experiment will be to cut off the bottom of the Energel NV and pull one
of those out just to erase all doubts that it also uses the LRN1. My money is on
the same as the Tradio -- LRN1. Either way, these Energels are at the top of the pile as far as Gel ink refills
in this world. Smoother, faster, blacker, brighter -- we Energel users have
tried ALL the competition and they don't come close. The only thing some inks have over the Energel is the pigment based inks, which
are better ""quality"" and are harder to wash off paper. So that's something the
folks at Pentel can get working on. But as far as impact and quality of writing, these Energel inks are absolutely
the best thing in writing besides fountain pen and ink! SO SMOOTH!! Keep it up
Pentel we love what you do!! "

mm) and the Pilot G2 Gel (0.38 mm). The ink also has a very, very slight amount
of feathering on poorer papers Not a bad pen per se, but will likely not purchase it again due to these

and the body + cap have some nice aesthetic details.The only downside I can

really IS that good. In fact, it's marvelous-- I've never been so enchanted by
how smooth and dark ink could be. I don't know how to explain it. it doesn't
skip, it doesn't pool, it doesn't smudge. It's just kind of, well, perfect. It doesn't hurt that the pen body is a beautiful blue with very subtle silver

needle point pens tend to scratch like crazy but this writes as smoothly as a
skater blade on ice. If you buy them, make sure you get at least three or four
and hide them. If a co-worker tries it out, you'll never get it back!"

start off very slippery but once its broken in its great.  Very light, could be
a good or bad thing if you have a death grip hold like I seem to get but usually
not a problem.  I have to say the 0.35 euro needle IS BEGGING to be in a

ran out of ink, which is fantastic.  I am a former user of the Uniball micro-tip
pens, which were great, but these Pentel's are unbeatable.  "

advertised, but it's thin enough for small writing.  I love this pen.  If only
Pentel would make a retractable version.  Runner up to this one is the Uniball
Signo RT 0.38 (finer line, lighter shade of blue, but slightly more scratchy)."

Paulina,"July 19, 2018",Too fine to be able to enjoy writing with it .
cevgar,"November 21, 2014","Not Recommended. There are better options. I am a fan of the Energel retractable
line, but picked this up as I would much prefer a smaller line width. While this
is not a bad pen (hence 4 stars), there are some... issues (hence, review). Problems:- Writes like a Retractable. Retractable liquid ink and gel pens usually have an
internal spring in the tip that pushes the ball against the front lip to seal
the ink and prevent the pen from drying out. This means that these pens require
more downward pressure to write, unlike the effortless way their capped cousins
tend to put down ink as soon as they touch paper. Compare the Pilot Precise
capped to the Precise RT. Generally this makes retractable pens better for
sporadic notes, but not as comfortable for essays. I wouldn't have considered
this an issue if it weren't that it...- Dries out like a Capped. This is expected, as it IS a capped pen, but with the
downward pressure required to get it writing I hoped otherwise. Nope. Says so
right on the barrel, ""Recap after use.""  Your ink life has a time limit. So, it
has the disadvantages of both retractable and capped pens, and none of their
respective advantages.- No way to check ink level (AFAIK). Final nail in the coffin for me. Should be
obvious from the photos, but there are no ink windows, and since it is not
refillable there is no way to open it and check the cartridge. If it stops
working, you'll never know if it dried out, got stuck, or is actually out of
ink. If this is your everyday carry, take a backup.Instead, consider a Pentel's Energel retractable 0.5mm. For a retractable they
require very little downward pressure, which can be further mitigated with the
AlloyRT's metal barrel (simply open to check ink level). Bonus, they are also
sold stateside. If you need a tip closer in size, consider the Morning Glory's
Mach3 0.38mm rollerballs. They use liquid ink, so they feather a bit, but write
much better. If you are dead set on a gel, the Uni Signo's... are popular.
Unlike ALL other Signo's I've tried, the UM-151 0.28mm I have actually writes
pretty well. It puts down a consistent line, without skipping, with little
pressure and is pretty smooth for it's tip size.Note: Downward pressure is probably not an issue if you don't write cursive. On
the other hand, if you print, why bother with a hybrid gel-liquid rollerball?
Just go for a standard gel or ballpoint and be done with it."
JC Lo,"August 16, 2018","Not typically a big fan of Sarasas, but I have to say this pen does its job. The
ink dries almost instantly after touching the paper, and highlighting over what
you just wrote feels like highlighting over printed text in a book. No smudges
at all.Of course if your paper is exceptionally glossy, it might not dry as quickly,
but this pen performs exceptionally well on normal paper. Perfect for taking
notes in class."
Amyk,"January 21, 2019","My first round with these pens was underwhelming,  but I think I just got a
fluke because I reordered and I am THRILLED.  These are my everyday pens now. 
My original  . 5 in black is nearly out of ink and I have purchased a refill
already.  These are fantastic pens and I reccomend highly. They do not smear, 
and I've paired them with Crayola markers,  tombow dual brush pens,  and the
Mildliners.  After three seconds they do not budge.   The ink is smooth and though it's not the blackest, or the bluest,  it's still
very pigmented.  Bleed through is not a problem,  though on really thin paper youay get some
ghosting.  My kokuyo campus paper LOVES these pens. They even work well on cheap
dollar store notebook paper.   I will be purchasing many, many more times.  "
KatOfCanterbury,"July 9, 2020","This is my FAVORITE pen of all time for note taking. I find that on certain
paper (typically low quality printer paper or standard American notebook paper)
the gel ink will smear when highlighted. However, this ink does not smear with
highlighter on Kokuyo campus notebook paper and is incredibly smooth to write
with. I enjoy the push clip mechanism and the rubber grip is comfortable in my
hands. I love to use this pen with the staedtler textsurfer highlighter. I have
not tried the other colors but I am looking forward to. 5/5 would recommend this
product to anyone. "
floss,"May 13, 2020","Easily one of my favorite pens right now. The ink flow is thick and puts a lot
of other pens to shame. It holds up to highlighter like it says it does. I also
think it looks cool. Definitely my go-to pen during Quarantine 2020."
Braden,"March 8, 2019","The pen looks cool, writes really smooth for the price, for the price the
quality of the pen is amazing and it feels great in the hand"
vinay.groupon.2014,"June 11, 2019","Dries very quickly.  However, writes a little rough for my liking.  "
Audrey,"May 24, 2019","I came across JetPens when I was searching for a gel pen that wouldn’t smudge
under highlighters. I was so glad to find this one! It works exactly as promised
with my Stabilo Boss highlighters. I’ve only found it to smudge if I highlight
over the same spot more than once. It writes smoothly and overall I have no
complaints!"
stephanie.parathyras,"September 24, 2018","This was a freebie. I have already found my pen soulmate, the Pilot Hi-Tec C .25
but I gave this to my friend and it's now his favorite pen. He loves the fast
dry gel, the amazing clip function, how will they write. He's amazed"
ethan.fields,"September 20, 2020","I don’t usually like a 0.5mm tip unless it’s needle tip and WOW! I bought a
few as a to have for EDC!!! Lovely pen!"
KittyB,"February 12, 2020","Love this pen! Definitely one of my top 3 recommendations for Tomoe River paper,
writes with minimal indenting or ghosting, dries instantly with no smudging and
you can highlight over it with any highlighter within moments.Very black ink and a nice weight to the line, a tad on the heavier side if you
are writing small. I will be trying the .4mm when it's back in stock for
comparison, but am definitely getting good use out of this one!"
gretchen,"December 9, 2019","This is a great gel pen that writes smoothly (honestly, I think it writes
smoother than others on the Sarasa line) and dries extremely quickly. It
doesn’t smudge under highlighter, including under the Zebra Mildliners, which
are notorious for smudging. Will be buying a refill soon! "
fabiolacookie,"January 24, 2019","I bought this pen early October and have used it almost everyday since then (I'm
actually buying a refill and decided to post a review). It is my absolute
favorite pen for note-taking, essay writing, or just writing in general. I'm not
a fan of having multi-colored pens while note taking so I usually only rely on
one or two black or blue gel pens. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves
gel pens but hates how easily they smudge, especially when you need to use a
highlighter. Also it is very smooth to write with and they don't bleed through
paper like other heavily saturated gel pens. Although these are definitely
different from the regular Sarasa Clip which are much slower at drying, they
still hold that same smooth quality. "
kateluvspigs,"December 22, 2018","Well, it does what it says it's going to do. I tried it with the pastel yellow
mildliner (which has smeared even my dry ballpoint pens) and it...didn't smear
that much when freshly written. However, after I let it dry for about 5 seconds,
there was no smear. Not too shabby for notes if I do say so myself. "
Nelly,"August 12, 2022","I love this pen!! I want to say that as someone that has a very strange grip
it's so comfortable to hold and write with! The ink is very smooth, and it
doesn't smudge! But of course it depends on the paper, if you're not using extra
expensive paper it *might* smudge. I recommend the pen, it'll be my everyday pen
from now on, I also bought refills for it! It's my first pen from this brand and
I'm so happy with it! "
ss8792,"November 29, 2021","Amazing pen! The ink in the Zebra Sarasa Mark On Gel Pen did not smear with any
of the highlighters I have used so far and it dries almost instantly. Great pen
for people who like to highlight their notes. This pen truly exceeds its
expectations, I love using it for taking notes."
cori.laraway,"November 27, 2021","Good pen, although the .5 line seems broad to me. I do prefer a thinner line.
The ink flows smoothly and it does let you highlight as soon as you've written. "
douglass.murray,"November 4, 2020","Amazing pen!  This might be my new favorite. I’m a lefty, and also got the
Sarasa Dry, but actually prefer this Mark ON. It dries extremely fast, fast
enough for the fastest lefty writer. I highly recommend. "
lvulpal,"October 3, 2020","I was surprised on how much I liked this pen! it dries fast (not as fast as
energel refil though) for sarasa ink"
hobiboh,"August 24, 2020","If you highlight your notes a lot, you need this pen. It dries so quickly, and
it doesn't smudge if you wait like 10-15 seconds. "
tesabee,"August 16, 2020","Pretty good for lefty writers. Smooth ink, doesn’t skip. It has minimal
smearing immediately after writing and dries quickly. It doesn’t hold up to
water or alcohol. But it does write on non porous surfaces, though not as
smoothly as some other permanent markers and pens. If you let it dry, it becomes
permanent. Not as good as the pilot multi ball, but it is a nice pen to write
with. "
juliaatduke,"July 31, 2020",I wish they also have 0.7 mm
cofferashley,"June 7, 2020","Left handed person here. This pen is on my rotation. I have been using it a lot,

bolvera122029,"January 13, 2020","Write smoothly and dry very fast. When used with mildliners it shows up
perfectly and doesn’t get smudged. Doesn’t really skip. I would purchase
again"
alanrodriguez0992,"August 27, 2019","The Sarasa Mark On is an amazing pen. I absolutely love the grip it has since
its lower than the regular pen. The ink is very dark and it really works. I've
used it with the Zebra Mildliners and Pilot Frixion and it never smudges. Would
totally recommend."
Kevin,"August 7, 2019","I was very disappointed when I got this pin ! I was expecting a very smooth pen
and got completely the opposite, extremely scratchy and not strong at all ! I
wouldn't reccomend it to anyone!"
asedmonds00,"July 1, 2019","The scratchiness is something to get used to but it does well in my planner. I
prefer not to use it when journaling as the ink sometimes skips and the feedback
is a bit ridiculous "
scabreraruiz05,"February 11, 2019","I use this for flash cards along with my stabilo boss highlighters and there’s
no smearing whatsoever "
Raven,"September 15, 2018","Love this gel pen. Writes smoothly in notebooks and in Hobonichi. Takes 3
seconds to dry in notebook, about 5-6 in Hobonichi. No smearing after dry.
Wonderful."
Blathers,"January 18, 2023","Not sure if this is something I should have been aware of, but this pen
doesn’t work on Tomoe River paper (in my Hobonichis).It skips more than a random ballpoint pen, smudges from touching even after 10+
seconds, and smudges and leaves black ink in my highlighter after 10+ seconds as
well. It’s the same way on the Sanzen paper Hobonichi will be using in 2024 (I
tested it on the sample).However, I tried it on some random paper in a cheap notebook, and it seems to
live up to the claims there. I guess it is a difference with coated vs. uncoated
paper? The ink still looks uneven sometimes like it is skipping, though. But it
happens less often, and I don’t really feel the skipping or scratching the way
I did on the Tomoe River paper.Good things: It doesn’t bleed through on either paper. The ink is absolutely
gorgeous and dark when it’s not smudged or skipping."
amanda,"January 18, 2023","What more can be said? It’s a Sarasa pen that dries extra fast. I even own the
Sarasa Grand, but still prefer the plastic bodies (including this one). Love the
style of this pen and works wonderfully for planning with highlighters. "
samosa,"January 14, 2023","Lasted me a super long time - especially with the number of notes I take. I also
used it for my essays on my AP exams and it did not fail. It doesn't smudge
unless you immediately and purposely do it, or if you highlight it with a
lower-quality highlighter."
little_book_worm,"January 13, 2023","This is brilliant. Highlighting and inking my essays and annotations have become
1000x easier. It dries faster than I can swap to my highlighter to mark up my
writing. Amazing pen."

wayne.renardson,"December 5, 2022","The pen did not at first write well but one of the customer service reps advised
me to remove the plastic cap on the pen's point and it worked fine. She also
advised me to heat the ink reservoir in warm/hot water to make the ink flow
better, which I did. It works fine.  I'm a fan of Jet Pens, having used several of their Pilot Varsity pens for music
charts. Excellent products. "
Xiangliang,"December 5, 2022","This has become my favorite everyday pen now. I actually don't have that many
chances to use highlighters above it, but even without the anti-smearing need,
writing with it simply feels good. It has just the right amount of resistance,
so it feels very smooth."
Kaylie ,"December 4, 2022","Very nice pen! The grip is low down so it’s very comfortable to hold for long
periods of writing. They never smear under my highlighters and i’ve tested
them with quite a few. The ink dries mostly quickly and the pen writes smoothly.
Definitely a staple for note taking :)"
jess loves pens,"December 2, 2022","Ordered this a month ago and it has already started to wear out. Plenty of ink
left in the cartridge but the ball isn't rolling smoothly or consistently.
Disappointed."
rockettegurrrl3,"December 1, 2022","I love the sarasa pens and this is my first .5mm. The perfect width for
journaling because it isn't too small, but is just thin enough that it doesn't
get messy and goopy. I haven't noticed much transfer or smudging, and I'm a
lefty!"
JXH1,"November 16, 2022","As a college student, I need pens that write smoothly and do not smear when I
highlight my notes.  At first, I was pleasantly surprised that this was one of
the few internet recommended items that actually lived up to its hype.  Since
then, I have made several several refills from the same pen line. 
Unfortunately, this year, I have struggled with how often my new pens skip. 
This is very frustrating given that my professors often speak very quickly
during lecture.  When it actually works, this is one of the best pens I could
recommend for college students.  However, when it skips, it takes several
minutes and maneuvers to get it going again.  For students taking notes by hand
during fast-paced lectures, this can mean missing important information.  Before
anyone asks, I followed all of the tips recommended on JetPen's Youtube Channel
for ""How to Revive Dry Pens.""  Sadly, it wasn't enough to revive my former
favorite pen."

SrirachaSandvvitch,"October 8, 2022","This is my favorite gel pen. I can highlight over it on Tomoe River paper and

complexreader,"October 5, 2022","As the name says - no lag time between writing and highlighting. I highlight
over it with both Zebra Mild Liner and Stabili Boss original - no problem! I use it on Midori MD Notebook grid block and Hobonichi TR paper. Writes well,
just wish it was more fluid to glide better on paper. However, it performs great
and I have multiples. Hoping the line expands in color with this formula if it's
possible. "

ahoffmeister198,"August 30, 2022","I like the way it writes, Sarasa is my favorite gel pen. With that being said it

Isabellahurtadoalvarez,"June 15, 2022","I’ve been using this one a lot more than the others I bought (Clena and Sarasa

lefties because the ink dries so fast it it won’t smudge. This pen is also
refillable, and they’re very affordable. (: "
kait,"May 28, 2022","I overall would not buy this pen. The one I have skips and just doesn't give me

does work "
jennynicole77,"May 17, 2022",Love the main selling point of no smudge with highlighting. Holds true. 
lexia velika,"April 15, 2022","I am a major proponent of the Zebra Sarasa Clip pens (with exception of the Milk
series that almost turned me off the brand) and the quality quality of this pen
greatly exceeds that of the Clips! Writes slightly rougher in a way that gives
off a pleasing, more tactile writing feel to me.The ink also holds up really well to highlighting just as advertised. Even with
immediate highlighting after writing, I experienced no smudging with a Justfit
Mojini Line highlighter. I also experienced minimal smudges with an immediate
highlight with a Sharpie S-Note and plain Sharpie highlighter. There was notably
more smudging after immediately highlighting with a Mildliner, but less than I
would experience after a full minute or more of drying time with other gel inks.
Very impressive considering how easily Mildliners smudge."
jystone0317,"April 14, 2022","Great pen! My only gripe would be that the flow isn't as great as I hoped, but

Vivien,"February 19, 2022","This is one of the best pens ever!(Though I haven't actually tried other Sarasas yet :D ) Its rich dark ink glides over paper really smoothly.Honestly, I don't use this with highlighters but if I ever do at least I know it
won't smear. I use this pen for my tracing and writing notes. It's good for
putting ink on artwork because its ink doesn't fade under vigorous erasing. But
I think for some of my tracings I would have preferred the 0.4mm tip size.The only thing is that the ink will ghost on papers, like my schoolbooks which
say that they are 70gsm. Other than that though the best pen, I've tried ever!
and that's a lot of pens, trust me. "
SOHare1981,"February 16, 2022","I really like Zebra Sarasa gel pens, (the only ones I've ever had issues with
are the milk colors). So, I was excited to try these. I love the grid pattern
body, and the smooth grip of the pen. The ink dries fast but when I tested it
with one of the darker mildliner's my ink still smeared a bit. Which the point
of these is they're not to smear. Though, I compared it to a regular Zebra
Sarasa clip pen it didn't smear nearly as bad as that pen. So, it's not a
hundred percent smear proof but it's pretty close compared to the regular Sarasa
gel pens.  I wish they offered more than three colors."

stinkybug3,"January 26, 2022","I really don't like Sarasas, and I thought I had long ago already found my holy
grail black gel pen... But this one has somehow become my new to-go. It is just
so convenient being able to highlight immediately after writing notes. If I
don't highlight my notes during the lecture, then my goldfish brain will forget
to do it forever and it is a nightmare to go back and review them during exam
season. (By then I can't even remember what was even worth highlighting at all
in the first place) If not for this gimmick, I'd give these like 1 or 2 stars. They skip horribly. I
can't write at certain angles. They almost always skip when I try to draw a line
or a box. "

hydrospanner,"April 25, 2021","The ink does what it says it does (dries quickly and plays nice with
highlighters) but unfortunately, the pen, or at least the one I got, is nearly
unusable because of it's horrible inconsistency.  It will write perfectly for a few words, then get into skipping, barely putting
down any ink, then blot a bunch of ink at once, then go completely dry until I
draw some loops to get it going again.Not sure if this is due to the ink, the point, my own left-handedness or what. 
It's on all paper I've used the pen on too, from Rhodia Dot Pads to low quality
copier paper, doesn't matter.  The blue and red Mark-Ons I bought at the same time as this one aren't *quite*
as bad...but they're still not good, with the same inconsistency issues.I bought this as an alternative to the disappointing Sarasa Dry pens I
previously purchased, but these are little better, unfortunately."
cindi,"March 31, 2021","Writes smoothly and dries quickly, what more could I ask for?"

evelyndr05,"March 16, 2021","The ink flow was very good, it didn’t smear with my highlighters which is the
reason I got it! I really recommend if your pens smear w other gel pens! "
Mintie,"March 9, 2021","I was debating between this and the dry, but I'm glad I got this one! It does
smear a little with mildliners, but that only really happens when you try to
highlight IMMEDIATELY after writing. Give it a sec and it won't smear! Its
definitely an improvement from the Sarasas I have which always smear no matter
what. Will definitely buy refills for this in the future, and maybe even invest
in a nicer pen body ^^"

I like that. You do have to wait at least ten seconds before using highlighter."
aquachuz,"November 20, 2020","The ink comes out nicely and is easy to write with.  I like to use it for

splashingcreek,"February 21, 2020","I was pleasantly surprised at the price of the pen, but for how much they are
raved about I was a little disapointed. The actual pen is not pad, it dries
imediately so it is effective for taking notes or annotations. The actual nib
though however skips and railroads a lot, so it takes a little getting used to.
The actual ink texture and color reminds me of the Muji gel ballpoint pen,
except the sarasa dries MUCH more quixkly and has a more comfortable grip.Over all I would recommend, just dont let this be the only pen in your
collection"

angle. Still smeared by the Mildliners, but overall a nice pen with deep black
ink."
Meri,"November 20, 2019","Nice looking pen which excited me with the description of not smearing when
highlighted; however, using three different highlighters on two types of paper,
the ink smeared both right after using this pen and waiting for some time after
using the pen. It also, much to my annoyance, smeared when my hand rested on it
as I am a leftie. I had hopes but the only thing I can say I liked about this
pen is how dark black the ink is."
hollowaycookie,"August 14, 2019","This pen does exactly what it says it will!  No smudges from highlighters!

laylaopolka,"August 20, 2018","I love this pen so much!! It writes very smoothly, and even with my zebra
mildliners it doesn’t smudge!! My only problems with it is that I can’t see
how much ink is left from the outside and the biggest is only 0.5 which I
don’t prefer. But those are just little nit picky things."
bob_sieber,"November 12, 2013","I wanted a smooth-writing pen that writes with a very fine line.  Not knowing
what to choose, I bought a Pilot Hi-Tech-C 0.25mm, a Pentel Slicci 0.25mm, a
Uniball Signo 0.28mm, and the Uniball Jetstream 0.38mm, all with black ink.  The
Jetstream was really an afterthought - I expected the gel pens to be superior to
a lowly ballpoint.  And how fine could a 0.38mm ball write, anyway?  Boy, was I
wrong on both counts. To test the pens, I wrote several pages with each one on two kinds of paper. 
The Hi-Tech-C clearly wrote the finest line; so fine that it wasn't comfortable
to read my writing - too faint.  The Slicci and (surprise) the Jetstream were
tied for second place as far as thinness goes.  The Signo was easily the
thickest of the four. The Signo, the Hi-Tech-C, and the Slicci were very smooth but offered
resistance, like moving a canoe paddle through water.  The Slicci was best in
that regard, the Signo the worst.  The resistance of the Signo and Hi-Tech-C was
so great that I can't see myself writing with them very much; it would be too
tiring.  (Note that those pens probably write with much less resistance if you
choose a larger ball diameter.)  The Jetstream, on the other hand, moved across
the page with no resistance, but had just a tiny bit of that ""ballpoint feel"". 
You probably know what I mean, some kind of tactile feedback that gel pens don't
have. As far as comfort goes, the Signo and Jetstream were easily the best and the
Slicci was the worst.  The Slicci and the Hi-Tech-C are just sooo thin and
slippery that they are uncomfortable to hold, and I got tired of squeezing them
to keep them from slipping out of my hand. Skipping was really not a problem with any of the pens, although the Hi-Tech-C
and Jetstream did skip just a tiny bit once in a great while, with the Hi-Tech-C
worse than the Jetstream. The Jetstream ink, being a ballpoint, dries much faster than the gel pens,
pretty much instantly. All things considered, the Jetsteam was the clear winner, with the Slicci coming
in second. Finally, and best of all, you can buy the fantasticly comfortable Jetstream
Alpha Gel 0.7mm pen and replace the guts with a Jetstream 0.38mm refill, giving
you what I think is the all-around best pen on the market.  I didn't notice any
better pen bodies available for the Slicci, but if there were one, I would rate
the Slicci a close second. Hope that helps.  "
lauren.ciechanowski,"July 8, 2014","I never thought I would fall in love with a ballpoint. I did. Head over heels.
Buy this even if you hate ballpoints and only wound up on this page because your
finger slipped. Buy 10.  Smooth, clear writing. Occasionally the ink spits out a
little chunk of ink? I'm sure there's a word for this phenomenon but it happens
to most pens. In the scheme of this pen's performance passing it over because of
that would be like divorcing your husband because he wears Hanes instead of
Fruit of the Loom."
citizenforbetterment,"August 1, 2016","Fine point gel pens are basically the only pens I use. I have always had an
aversion to ballpoint pens; they're all greasy with uneven ink flow.This pen proved me wrong.The ink writes fantastically and flows smoothly. I never have a problem with
this pen skipping, even when I first tried it out.I strongly reccomend this pen, especially if you don't usually like ballpoint
pens. You'll love this one.My ONE dislike is the pen body. The clip feels kind of cheap, and I do find it
uncomfortable to hold. However, when I put the ink cartridge in a Pilot Juice
body it works fine and is a lot more comfortable to write with. I can definitely
overlook the pen body being uncomfortable, though, because the ink quality is so
great. I wish I could give this a 4.5 / 5."
claireserenska,"August 10, 2014","Absolutely a fantastic pen.  I used it to the last drop of ink.  It writes very
smoothly and very finely, as expected.  I write very small, but slowly, so I
prefer very fine points that do not bleed.  I had no problems with this pen.  I
used to use a Zebra Sharbo X, but as that has been discontinued, I got this as a
replacement and in fact prefer it by far.  Extremely cost-effective.  I am back
buying three more (since I did, in fact, use the last drop of ink).  The only
problem I had was completely negligible: the grip got a bit stretched out by the
end there, and sometimes shifted around the body a little.  I will update if
that was a one-time thing.  Otherwise, and excellent purchase that I intend to
make again many times in the future."
pamfuchs11,"June 21, 2015","I once borrowed a Uni Jetstream from a friend and was thrilled when she said I
could keep it. The pen swiftly and securely clicks into action. And the nib!
It's a beauty! It literally dances across the page, adds muscular flair and
originality to my signature and written work.  "
mmmm,"January 6, 2016","I really like this pen. It gives a nice fine black line, though the ink does dry
to a slightly lighter black. For such a fine tipped pen, it does not skip or
have problems with ink flow. One of my favourite note taking pens.  Only problem is that I run through the ink refills very quickly. "

nmholbrook13,"July 13, 2019","I appreciate being able to find such a fine point on a ballpoint pen. The ink
does not spread at all, so I found that the lines I got with the jetstream were
actually much finer than other pens I have in the 0.38 tip size. I did
experience some skipping, which is why I deducted a star. In terms of writing
pressure, I found that I do have to apply more pressure to write with this pen
than I do with my gel pens, but not substantially more. "

water and the pen writes over damp paper very well. The only bad thing is it
skips and you need to add pressure while writing, but this is a con with
ballpoint pens in general and not unique to this pen. But this does the job so
I'm very happy."

both of those things are inherent to this style of pen. Lightweight but not
fragile. Slender with a smooth grip, so easy for smaller hands to hold."

Smudge Surviving,"February 7, 2020","At first, I wasn't so sure about this pen. I tend towards gel pens and
fineliners. But all the smudging in my planner and notes has finally, after
years and years, gotten me to try out a high-quality ballpoint pen.I'm pleasantly surprised. It's kind of addicting. You can't feel the ""flow"" like
with a gel pen, but it still writes without being scratchy in my planner (by
Papier) and my journal (Moleskine mini journal thing. Forget name). It's also
very good for small handwriting.Sometimes it skips, but it's not enough to make me stop using the pen."

ADR in NY,"January 26, 2020","This review is about this pen's hybrid/emulsion ink and not the pen barrel
itself. What I love most about hybrid ink (with blue being preferred over black)
is its deeper color than that of ballpoint (oil-based) ink along with its
ability to be highlighted over immediately after writing, especially when
writing with the 0.38 mm tip. This is a quality I have learned to be grateful
for and appreciative of, especially considering the wait time necessary to
safely, with absolutely no smearing whatsoever, highlight over gel ink. Some
time, at least 10 seconds, is needed to pass before highlighting if using a 0.5,
and 0.7 mm tips and more if using a 1.0.  While I agree that gel ink produces a
more deeper and vibrant color and would ultimately be the one I choose for
everyday writing, hybrid ink gets very high marks for how long it lasts, its
richer color than ballpoint ink, and its ability to hold up extremely well to
water and water-based highlighters. Hybrid ink is my recommendation above all
others for students and extensive note-takers."
Tangle List,"December 28, 2019","Although I’m a fan of the Uni Jetstream brand, I’m not a fan of the 0.38 in
particular. It’s very scratchy and it skips. The Uni Jetstream 0.5 is far
smoother, more comfortable, and produces a line that’s nearly as fine as the
0.38. Indeed, one thing you need to know about the Jetstream brand is that the
lines they produce are finer than advertised. The Jetstream 0.5 produces a line
that looks like it came from a 0.38 on other pens, and the Jetstream 0.38 is
even finer than that. Unless you absolutely need that fine of a line, you’re
much better off with the Jetstream 0.5 instead. "

smooth and I've personally found no problems with skipping or scratching though
I have noticed that co-workers whom have borrowed it have torn through paper due

Overall an excellent choice."

namie,"September 4, 2018","This pen is very nice to write with and dries very fast. I love taking notes and
writing in my planner with this because I can go back with a highlighter without
waiting for very much time and the highlighter won't smear at all. It is thin
and smooth and feels nice to hold."

bassoasis,"July 12, 2018","I found this pen to be excessively scratchy compared to a Jetstream 0.7.
Obviously, it will work well for those who like very thin, extremely precise
lines (and the pen is the usual great Uni quality), but at the expense of not
having the smoothness that Jetstream pens are known for."
stationeryangel,"March 10, 2018","Lifespan IssuesI love jetstream pens and their ink. However, it does not last. Each refill I've
used only last about 2-3 weeks of lectures for me thus far. I am also not a
heavy note taker. I also bought pens that used this ink for my partner and he complained of the
same problem. Don't get me wrong, the ink is pretty amazing but only for the first two weeks.

tijerinaj38,"October 1, 2017","The grip is shaped rather awkwardly. I'm not sure if there is a special way to
hold it. Unlike the teardrop shape of the 207/307, these Jetstreams have a
partial recess opposite of the clip on the grip. When holding the pen with the
grip faced away from my hand, this leaves a small raised part of the grip for my
middle finger to rest on. It seems like they were going for just the bare
minimum amount of grip area when holding it but it just does not work out for
me. The ink writes just as smoothly as everyone says. The color is ok, not bad
but I think the Pilot Acroball has darker color. In the end though, the grip
really kills this pen for me."

fit in my leather TN pen holder. "
Jason,"March 3, 2017","I was very excited about this pen as it has stellar reviews.  Unfortunately, the
pen is unusable for me, and my guess is that the pen I have is defective since
most reviews are very positive. The first thing I noticed was the lack of smoothness when writing. The pen is
skipping horribly as a pool of ink forms on the opposite side of the of the side
which is contacting the paper. I've tried different angles, different pressures,
and different paper, and the problem is consistent. "
Ben the CSI Guy,"February 28, 2017","This is, by far, my favorite ballpoint pen.  The ink that is utilized by
Jetstream pens are superb, better than most inks in ballpoint pens.  It goes on
smooth, dries fast, has a gel-ink feel to it but the drying time of a ""normal""
ballpoint pen type of ink.  I write small, so I am all about the .38 mm pens.  I also have a Jetstream in .7
mm - which utilizes the same ink but with a thicker line...I prefer the .38 to
the .7, but it is all personal preference - however the ink of the Jetstream is
top grade.  If you are thinking about the Jetstream line of pens...purchase it
because I believe there are no better ballpoint pens on the market.  "

Supplies Enthusiast,"November 9, 2016","I can't believe this is a ballpoint pen. The ink is so smooth, the pen tip
fairly glides across even cheap copy paper. So it's sheer joy to write with this
on great paper. Ink saturation is nice and dense, even at the 0.38 size. "
azelf,"October 10, 2016","This is one of my absolute favorite pens. I use it extensively for taking notes
and for doing other schoolwork/homework because it writes incredibly smoothly
and doesn't smudge when highlighted over. I love this because it is a ballpoint
pen that keeps the smoothness and consistency of a gel pen (in fact, it's even
more smooth and consistent than any gel pen I've ever used). The small fine tip
is perfect for my handwriting size and doesn't force me to write larger than I
normally would. Unlike gel pens, the lines created by this pen are true to the
tip size because it is not gel ink, so the ink doesn't spread out as it hits the
paper. In addition, the ink barrel lasts forever (I've been using this for
multiple pages of writing almost daily for three months) and I would assume the
same for the refills. Strangely though, my handwriting is a bit messier when I
use this pen and I'm not sure why. Overall, this is an incredible pen that I'm
very glad I tried out and I don't know what I would do without it. Writing is 10x more comfortable with this pen. The ink flows very easily and
smoothly so I never have to press down orapply any sort of pressure when writing. This, and the soft grip (not as squishy
as an Alpha Gel butsofter than most I've encountered) make writing with this easy and keeps my hand
from gettingsore/tired."
charmarq2,"July 22, 2016","I have originally thought that gel pens were the only pens that were capable of
making such a fine point along with being smooth. I originally got a 0.7 mm
Jetstream off of Staples and noticed the smoothness that this pen had. I
remember finding out about this model and being extremely happy but desperate
for one. When I finally got one, the dream finally came true. The size is
comparable to a Signo RT1 0.28 mm but at the same time smoother than my Signo DX
.28 mm. No other hybrid ballpoint pen has gotten this thin and this is easily
gotten to my top rankings among mostly gel pens. "

donzavor,"May 23, 2016","Excellent, smooth, never skips"
rae.matthews,"May 4, 2016","These are one of my favorite pens (0.38 mm tip specifically). For such a thin
line, they write smoothly without being too scratchy on the paper. The only
downside is they have a tendency to break. I've had at least three just
completely bust apart while writing with them, I'm thinking this is due to how
much pressure I'm putting on the tip. That said, I still keep buying these
because they make such a great line and write so well. Because they break on me, I don't bother buying the refills for these. In my
experience the refill will last longer than the pen body. But it's a great pen."
irishdancer,"April 20, 2016","This pen compared to the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen - 0.38 mm is a bit

lack of color options. "

tighter than any other 0.38mm pen than I have tried and they have great
longevity.  The ultimate Ballpoint pen.  My only reservation is that when you
push the pen in upstroke (vs. dragging the tip) the ink can pile up on the tip
and leave ugly blobs on hanging loops etc.  So I'm wiping off the tip like a dip
pen often. Besides personal issues with the pen, it is one of the best pens I
have in my pocket.  Writes in the rain so when I'm not using a Signo or fountain
pen I go to a Jetstream.  The 0.38mm brought me to Jetpens.com.  I'll keep their
stock rotated.  "

eddiej.wa,"February 24, 2015","My new favorite ballpoint pen!  Previously had enjoyed using the Zebra
Technoline 0.4 ballpoint for a year with no complaints.  What happened was I was
searching for an even thinner line ballpoint pen and found the Jetstream 0.38
mm.  Thought I would give it a try.  Wow! was surprised at the consistent flow
and thin line.  Always started right up with no complaint and only rarely when
first used had an occasional very minimally increased line thickness.  Was
walking in my grocery store with a glove still on my left hand when it fell out
of my hand! was really upset that I could not find it- somebody must have picked
it up immediately; even employed the store manager to help but to no avail! 
Thus had to immediately order another set! Use time only one month. Especially
like the very smooth point, not scratchy at all, glides over nearly all surfaces
without skipping.  Have not used the replacement refills yet.  A really great
find and now my favorite ballpoint pen!"

Slicci in 0.25 and the Signo RT1 in 0.28. I expected this to be the worst due to
the fact that it is a ballpoint. However I soon learned my lesson, never judge a
book by its cover. This easily wrote finer than the others, maybe with the
exception of the Hi-Tec-C, when it wrote. The blue color was beautiful. Easily
my favorite ballpoint pen, and has a good shot of being number one on my list"

Crieff,"January 1, 2015","I don't know much about pens aside from the commonly used Pilot G2s, but I had
problems using those. My hand placement would always smear the ink and I always
wished for a thinner tip. This is the first pen I bought from JetPens, so there might be slight bias but I
will try my best to justify it. I love this pen. This is the pen I have in my
backpack, my purse, and my pouch at work. It's definitely a light pen, but well
made and constructed. I like the curved grip. It fits nicely with my hand and
the rest of the pen. The tip is very fine and thin and is very noticeable when
writing. There's a very light ""scratchy"" feeling when writing, but I enjoy that
feeling. The ink flows nicely. It doesn't smear and it doesn't splot out. It
never skips. It does everything I ever wanted in a pen. This pen pushed me to begin a journey of pen-exploration. I have also purchased
a Pilot Acroball Ballpoint Pen 0.5 mm, which is the smallest tip. The Pilot is
also very nice, but the tip size makes the Jetstream better for me. "

gmellen,"November 11, 2014","This pen has a precise feeling, with some ability to vary the darkness and width
of the line using different pressures, which I like.  The feeling borders on a
bit of scratchiness (that I don't like), but the line is quite consistent
despite that very slight scratchy feeling.  This is a nice pen for crosshatching
because of the feeling of real precision.  The line width of my 0.38 seems to
compare to other pens of slightly smaller width.  "
Soralina,"November 10, 2014","It's a great pen that write really smoothly... I think it's a little delicate

laukarpuska,"November 5, 2014",Good pen. Still prefer pilot though. 
onealkm,"October 14, 2014","The Uni Jetstream line has done it again. For a .38 mm tip, this pen writes as

addition to my pen arsenal and allows me to create some very small and neatly
written notes."

wpbnb,"April 15, 2014","Excellent pen. At first this pen was scratchy with uneven ink flow.  Then I quickly realized I
was holding it at too low of an angle.  This pen has a small sweet spot and
needs to be held at a slightly higher vertical angle.  After doing that, the pen
wrote very smoothly with a very fine and crisp line. As usual for Uni pens, the build quality is excellent with a solid click
mechanism.  I really like the look and solid feel of this pen.  Very comfortable
to write with. If you want a really sharp, crisp and fine line, this is the pen.  Highly
recommend."

bought two of these pens and BOTH of them barely work. I was so excited to have
a reliable, thin pen that I wouldn’t have to wait to dry in order to

constantly stops writing and isn’t very smooth. I am unfortunately
disappointed:("

AlrightOkNYC,"July 14, 2010","This was one of my first brush pens and I'm glad it was - it provides a very
good introduction to what is possible with a brush pen. The tip is hard and sharp but becomes slightly more pliable after some use.
Excellent line variation is possible (very fine detail to a nice thick line) and
it is easier to control than standard brush pens (e.g. Pentel Pocket) due to its
hardness.  My single reservation is that on some paper, I wish the ink was slightly darker
and I also wish it held up better to erasing. After some research and
experimentation, I have discovered that the right paper makes all the difference
(Borden & Riley Paris Bleedproof Paper For Pens - is quite expensive but superb
for all of my ink-related illustrations - and wonderful with this pen)."

I had to give them away. I use them both for drawing and writing with very sexy

quickly.I cannot believe I found them again after much searching. They are like finding

geminica,"August 18, 2010","I love this pen for cartooning - you get a good variable width line, but it's a

cartooning pen.  I think I like the tip on this one a little better the tip on the Zebra Sign

soft brushes difficult to control, this is a great brand with tons of brush nib
experience. It's one of my favorite tools now. "
jmullins,"August 4, 2017","Tombo and Zebra are about comparable.  The only gripe I have about these pens is
that they force you to slow down your drawing stroke...because if you don't, the
ink line railroads and skips. These pens therefore are not as good for a
sketching tool as they would be for inking your artwork. Just a thought...Good
pens though, especially when new as they can achieve a very fine line or thick
depending on how hard you press down.  I would recommend trying out one to see
for yourself."

thetadrex,"January 27, 2016","This pen is well made and comfortable to use when gripped. The tip of the pen is
unique, in that it maintains the precision of a 0.3 or 0.4 tip, but can be

pen to ink with. "
slipcat,"August 6, 2015","Some people like these, but I do not fee the line is anything special.  they
can't handle a faster stroke,  you have to take it easy or the lines fade..
Controlling ""shakiness"" in your lines is easier with these pens,  but I want a
pen with dark ink and that can handle a little faster stroke. The hard and the
soft are fairly similar in quality, I would prefer the Soft just a little over
the hard as it handles the stroke maybe a tad better.   Still, there are other

mireke,"August 17, 2017","Great pen, but for my inexperience hands and brush calligraphy, Pentel Touch
deserves 1/2 star more. "
kimberly.j.venesky,"July 24, 2017","I bought this hard tip brush pen to practice my Japanese writing as I learn my
hiragana and katakana, but I wish the nib was a bit larger. There really isn't a
lot of play in the way the nib writes, which is its only downfall. It performs
well in my Leuchtturm1917 journal and surprisingly does not feather at all. Next
I'll try the soft tip Fudenosuke brush pen, hoping it works better for my needs."

ergurney,"September 21, 2015",The hardest of the three brush pens I bought.  Too hard for me.
Howard Tayler,"February 11, 2015","It's not a true brush, but it's perfect. This pen, along with the Soft - Black
Body, fills the gap between rigid technical pens and true brushes. I use this
for adding line width to technical pen lines, and for light shading. Best of
all, the nib is an amazing non-felt polymer thing. I can really lean on it and
it doesn't split. I also use this for medium-width freehand line art, since I
can vary the line weight with pressure. "
Miss Adiantum,"November 6, 2014","Update on this pen.I really love it! Back in my earlier review of this I had stated it was a little
too dry and it was too firm, well after playing around with it and making some
comparisons between this one and the double ended Uni I have, I must say I
prefer this and my Sakura Pigma pen for lining finer details. I have to say that
the dryness goes away after breaking in the pen with a few drawings, I would
recommend giving it a try especially at this good price!"
cheyloestuff,"January 16, 2023","Absolutely is smear free. I can use highlighter and markers with it. It might
replace my microns from sakura but I need to compare them a little more.
Absolutely no bleed through even when I use cheaper paper. I still use my sakura
microns for my art right now but I can't stop Journaling with this!"
bco003,"January 6, 2023","Great for brush lettering. Knocked off one star because the one I got was
actually made in Vietnam rather than Japan. It’s a subtle difference but I do
notice the brush tip quality isn’t quite the same as the original Japanese
version."
angelfendi10,"January 3, 2023",Been buying for years.  Love them.   
Cindy S,"November 23, 2022","Not sure this is a pen I have to have all the time, but it works very well. The
line is fine and dries fast. As I use it more I might find it's indispensable
for shading ink drawings or sketching, but I usually like a softer wetter tip. I
can always find a use for anything though, and sometimes it takes awhile to warm
up to something that's not my usual stuff. Those are just personal things
though, I have no complaints about the quality of the pen."

withadventure,"August 29, 2022","I love this pen. I use it for sketching and shading, writing bold reminders in
my planner, multimedia art, and journaling. The texture of the nib makes it fun
to write with and lets you get a good range of line width depending on the angle
you write in and how hard you press. And I've had this pen for years and it still writes. I'm sure it will run out of
ink eventually but it's been a great value for the money and I will be
repurchasing it when my current one dies. "
seedyleaf,"July 27, 2022",The go-to for sketches. So good.
maicolito,"July 22, 2022","Incredible for beginner to advanced artists! The brush nib isn’t too stiff nor
soft. The line variation that is possible with this pen is beautiful for a
“hard” brush nib. I use this pen for lining artwork or even for sketching
when I want interesting line work. Don’t even get me started on calligraphy!
It’s perfect for brush lettering small titles and headers. Overall an amazing
pen! "
SherryS,"June 16, 2022","This is exactly what I was looking for and it didn't disappoint in feel or
color."
Cookie,"June 1, 2022","I’m honestly pretty disappointed with the Tombow Fudenosuke for all of the
hype that it gets. While it is true that it is easy to control, it doesn’t
give a ton of line variation, unless you push very hard, which results in a lot
of damage to the tip. It may be great for beginners, but I believe that for more
advanced users it isn’t the best. It is a good option for those who like brush
pens with a lot of control. "

dustinlrhc,"November 21, 2021",Writes magnificently! 
leha,"November 20, 2021","This brush pen is addictive. Think of it more like a ""flex nib"" than a ""brush
tip."" It has just the right amount of hardness to push back on the hand's
tendency to waver over a brush, but offers more flexibility and line variation
than is often comfortable (or advisable) to push a pen nib to. This brush tip is
multidirectional, unlike a pen nib, while offering that springy resistance that
you don't get with other brush tips.The Fudenosuke also lays down a dark, beautiful ink that rivals many of the inks
you could get from a bottle. Not only is it fun to draw with, but it holds up remarkably-well under a variety
of media. I have tested it under acrylic marker, Copic marker, brushed alcohol,
brushed wax & linseed oil blender, mineral solvent, watercolor, colored pencils,
Inktense pencils, and Pitt brush pens. It stands.If you are drawing in black and crave a flex tip, but hate the scratchiness and
directionality of a pen nib, give this brush pen a try."

ashley.mh.wilson,"August 10, 2020",I love this pen! It's a great basic for brush lettering! 
Guest,"August 5, 2020","This pen is absolutely amazing for writing in Japanese and Chinese. Treat
yourself if you've only used regular pens for Japanese/Chinese before and give
this a try. You can actually see the subtle differences in the weight of the
strokes, plus the thickness is perfect for being able to do more intricate
characters with 15+ strokes.I bought both this one (hard, shikkari) and the soft counterpart (nayaka). Both
are great but I prefer this one for notebook-size writing. The soft version
tends to make thicker strokes (so harder to precisely write intricate characters
at a small size) but if you can control it properly you can get them thinner -
but I'm not at that skill level quite yet."

strength, not much fade over time. "

black fudenosuke is honestly the only color you need, cute and minimalistic. i

this pen is that there is a hard tip and a soft tip and I like them both, but
one has a dark blue cap and one a black cap and I can never remember which is
which and have to take the caps off and…It's also hard to tell the dark blue
from the black. Otherwise a wonderful pen."
kgfallis,"April 3, 2020","I'm glad I ordered the hard version of this pen. I'm a heavy-handed drawer and
writer and feel that this pen gives me excellent control of the brush."
enbybee,"March 31, 2020","Flexible, versatile, smoothThis brush pen is very versatile, in that it isn't just helpful in brush
lettering but can be used for making my (rather hideous) handwriting look neat
and swirly. Little effort is required- just write, and letters look like
calligraphy. Before getting this I had used a Uni Pin Brush which I found hard
to control and quite scratchy, but this pen is a total revelation. Despite being
sold as a hard brush, it's nice and flexible, more than you would expect from
looking at it. Not too flexible though; a problem I find with soft brush pens is
I cannot control line widths. This is simple. Exerting pressure gives an elegant
and crisp line, with a normal line thin and clear. This pen is very smooth to
write with, and its ink is dark and professional looking. After about six months
of using the same one I do find the tip blunts slightly, but this is not
detrimental to its properties and is most likely due to my heavy writing style.
Smudge proof, and easily drawn over with a Copic Sketch. My friend has taken to
stealing it during art lessons, and she has been badgering me to order her one!
As she is extremely fussy when it comes to stationery and wrote off an
SPMultiliner by pressing too hard, while saying a Kuretake Clean Color was ""too
swishy"", I think that is high praise indeed. I find it ideal for drawing comic
and manga pages, and as a hard brush pen it is a cheap way of getting good line
widths. The alternative would be buying lots of fine line pens, which I wouldn't
use extensively. Good for writing, sketching, drawing and just about anything,
buying this is a no brainer. "

wear down like others I’ve used. However, after having the this pen for a
while I found that the thickness of the stroke would sometimes fluctuate
mid-letter. I think for this reason I’d recommend this pen to more
heavy-handed individuals. I’ve used it in planning and on cards with great

sold this way in Japan. I have not studied calligraphy so I do not know how to
use this pen properly but I like the way it looks. I may use it to write headers
in my bullet journal to start."

Mintea Bujo,"April 3, 2019","I love this brush pen and it's one of my favorites! This was my very first brush
pen and I'm glad I purchased it. The fine hard tip makes it super easy to
control to make super thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes. The only issue I
have with this pen is that it feathers slightly in my bullet journal. However,
this is a minor thing and it just depends on what paper you use, so this is
still a great brush pen"

isaiah,"January 5, 2019","Really great product, I was skeptical when buying at first becuase I heard the
soft tip was better but this was the right tip for beginners. It came packaged
which is nice so it wasnt ruined during shipping. The only thing you should be
aware about is that the pigmentation isnt fully black! It's a very dark grey
thats lightened. So if youre looking into a fully black pigment I would say go
for the pentel fude brush sign pen! Other than that, great product would
reccomend if you don't mind the fully not black wash"

o_bad2003,"November 24, 2018","Good pen. Tip is too soft for my writing style. Not for quick writing. Love the
ink flow though "
mariainc,"November 18, 2018","This is a good brush pen for beginners, but for me, it ran out of ink very
quickly. Even when it did have ink, the pen was not--for lack of a better
word--juicy and the downstrokes oftentimes looked streaky and incomplete. My mom, who is a beginner at brush lettering, loves this pen, but as someone who
has been brush lettering for a while now, I much prefer the small Pentel brush
pens or other larger, juicier pens. "

Yane,"October 16, 2018","Everywhere I see that the hard pen is the best for beginners, but I might just
be weird.  I honestly preferred the soft nib to the hard nib since I don't
honestly like the paper thin upstrokes.  I can get a smoother and juicier
downstroke with the soft nib as well.  I just felt like the hard nib required
significantly more pressure in order to get the look I want.  That doesn't mean
this is a bad pen by any means.  It's fun to write with and I like the
versatility I have with it when I doodle.  "
Morphie,"October 12, 2018","I bought this pen due to how popular and highly recommended it is. I was a
beginner in brush pens, and used to use the Sakura brush pens (though later
figured out that they're probably more suitable for brush drawing, I dislike the
quality of those because the brushes frayed easily and were too soft, they were
also very hard to control). I found the these pens to be a lot easier to use in
comparison to the soft brush pens, and I love how dark the ink and smooth the
ink can be. The only thing that irritates me is how you have to go back to a
certain angle in which you've been using your brush pen on, as the pliable nib
gets more-so fixed to a certain direction at some point. Another thing I've
noticed is that sometimes, when you apply pressure to get a thicker line, the
lines are somewhat distorted (not a fine, thick, line). It's quite hard to
explain and it could just be of the way I hand-letter, but I do not face these
issues when using the Pentel Fude-Touch Pens.Overall, good pen, good grip and rather easy control, ink is rather dark and
smooth. Cons are that the pliable nib gets fixated to a certain point over time,
has a very long drying time before you can erase over it, erasing over it
lightens the ink, and that the lines are not always smooth/fine."
woojaq,"September 19, 2018","Love this pen.  Smile every time I open the container to look at it.  Using it

mollyshopsonline,"March 5, 2018","As a complete beginner to brush lettering (and left-handed, to boot!), this pen
finally helped me get the control I needed to make a significant difference in
my upstrokes and downstrokes. This pen is the most similar to a ""normal"" pen--it
flexes, but not as much as the soft Tombow fudenosuke or the Pentel Touch Sign.
It's shaped the most similar to a ""normal"" pen; unlike a large brush pen that
can seem unwieldy, this Tombow is compact enough to maneuver easily but thick
enough to let you get a good grip.  After practicing with this pen for several
weeks, I gained the muscle memory and the control to move onto softer, more
flexible pens, but I find myself returning to this pen to run drills and warmup
before using some of the more ""difficult"" pens I own."

not survive without them. I highly recommend them to anyone. "
ADR in NY,"January 29, 2018","I'm new at brush lettering and this particular brush pen is recommended in many

rezogo,"October 4, 2016","I give it four stars, because it gives you a kind of line, which is on the
thicker side moments after you release your (down) stroke pressure. Doesn't
momentarily regain sharp tip. It might be better for drawing, otherwise your
lettering should be on the smaller scale. Use some kind of coating on your
paper, conserves ink, works finer. A bit smudgy though. Five stars for extremely
high quality!"

abhi.and.leigh,"January 29, 2014","First off awesome shipping. Took 2 days and my stuff is here.  As for the pen,
it's a great pen for lettering in general. I even managed to pull off some
copperplate using this but you gotta be patient to get the width right. Overall
the best brush lettering pen I've used thus far. The black ink is nice and dark
and if you have pencil strokes over it, they can be removed without leaving
traces of it. The great thing is although the pen is hard it's got enough flex
to it but you gotta go gently with it and you're good to go.  "
jasonweaveresq,"January 2, 2014","I ordered this one along with the Pilot Fude-Makase Color Brush Pen. Both are
comparable. If you have one, you may not need the other, and I find them to both
be very similar.  I like this pen a lot. I have all the Zebra ones and this one seems a little
less mushy, with a slightly thinner line. It's a good addition w the Zebras. I
like the blacks, and the fact that I can get a very thin line, but still with
some variation. "
endlsdremr,"April 1, 2013","This is my fav brush pen. I have tried more expensive brush pens, but this one

nicely for me (I may have a heavy hand though). I would highly recommend it. I
have already bought several, and have even given them away as gifts!"

Franklin Booth Style, old school pen and ink Comic book illustrations, these
things ROCK ! While I admit my hand is very harsh ( I use a .9 lead in my pencils ) that take
a toll on these pen's tips ( my pens still have ink, but I have worn out the
nibs), but of you have a delicate ( normal ) hand, these things are a godsend
for comic book artists and illustrators. I have recommended these to several
friends and they love this too. So in short, give these a try, you will wonder why you have never tried these."
biffybeans,"November 30, 2009","I absolutely LOVE these pens - the short hard tip allows for lovely fine line

kimcondra,"November 3, 2016","I love this pen and the others I got with my order.  I wanted to try brush

decided to buy a few of the pens I read about from other brush calligraphers and
I am so glad I did!  The tip on this pen is wonderful.  I have been using it now
for a couple of days and it is still working great."
justacreativerperson,"April 12, 2015","This, along with a pilot metropolitan fine nib, was my first purchase here on
jet pens and I'd just like to say, not only am i extremely happy with my
purchase, but also the service. Maybe i have the area i live in or USPS to be
thankful for, but i was expecting my package to come in in a week, and believe
me when i say i was pleasantly suprised to have my package in TWO days. So i
just thought I'd throw that in, because Jet pens has just earned a new customer.Now, to the pilot Metropolitan, the medium nib is actually rather fine, and as
you probably know there is no actual substantial ""fine, medium, or broad""
because it honestly depends on where you buy it. So, this medium would be, about
an American fine. It's comfortable to use and flows nicely.  It's teriffic for
beginners and the case is quite lovely. It makes it seem like a special and
expensive spy pen, or you know, fountain pen. Anyways, i love writing with it
and definitely would recommend it. It comes with a squeeze converter and black
ink cartridge as said. The cartridge is out of the body. The converter is
already installed, but fair warning when you take it out, it can require a bit
of pull. Or maybe that was just me. It does also come with a very small
instruction pamphlet. Now most should already know this obviously,  but just in case, the pilot
metropolitan does not have much, if any at all ,line variation. That's not quite
what it's for. So don't expect super thin, then super thick lines because that's
not happening. Otherwise,  all around great pen certainly worth the buy."
gpsabin,"November 2, 2015","I would prefer a different type of ink reservoir but the provided one works
well.  I realize now I should have been looking for a broad nib as the medium is
thinner than I like   For the price, I can't imagine a better pen. "
dicobalt,"January 27, 2013","This is only my 2nd type of fountain pen but wow I am impressed.  This is a
wonderful pen even under heavy usage.  I have been using Noodler's Blue Eel and
Gruene Cactus Eel in both of my Metropolitans.  So far I have written 46 pages
of notes in the last 4 days with two of these pens (one green ink, one blue
ink).  I did have to dip the nibs in water once to clear them, that was probably
because of the special lubricated Eel ink I guess?  Otherwise they have been
amazingly smooth and consistent compared to the Platinum Preppy pens I was using
before.  What's more amazing is that this pen did it on extremely cheap
$1/notebook paper.  The squeeze converter holds plenty of ink (even for me) and
it works perfectly too.  This pen sells for much more in Japan and Europe and I
can see why.  My only complaints are that the clip is too stiff and the cap
doesn't easily post so it tends to fall off if you don't push it on there
firmly.  If those two things aren't a problem for you then this is definitely a
pen you want to get.  "
jameses,"July 25, 2013","This pen (and the entire Metropolitan line) from Pilot is an amazing value. I
use this pen on a daily basis and without a doubt, this one is my favorite. It
comes with the converter, and a cartridge. The converter doesn't hold much ink,
about one week's worth, but that's enough for me as I like to change ink colors
frequently. If you're on the fence, get off now and buy this pen now!"
wscott,"March 19, 2018","I love the feel of the pen in hand and while writing, but I prefer to post my
cap and that is where the Metropolitan fails ... badly. First, the cap is held
with pressure only and it frequently falls off even when attached with a good
amount of force. Even worse, however, is that ink residue in the cap will get on
the back of the pen and create a mess of your hands, desk and/or pockets once
exposed.None of these issues apply to my Lamy starter pen which, unfortunately, does not
write a smoothly but at least keeps me and my work surface clean."
chrispmoellering,"September 17, 2014","Fantastic EDC Pen This is my everyday carry pen. It is always by my side ready to go. I use the
Pilot cartridges and they are convenient and reliable. I look for excuses to
write things so I can use this pen. Nice fit and finish, consistent, clean
writer. Handles a wide range of paper like a champ. I can't say enough good
things about this pen."
annalisa,"October 25, 2017","I love this pen for writing in my journal, which has paper that has a satin
finish. It doesn't smear. The ink dries fast. I've used this pen in the
Hobonichi Techo planner and the Passion Planner without problems, although on
the Hobonichi you can see through the back, but it doesn't bleed through (same
with gel pens). Easy to load the cartridges and get the ink flowing. Good
all-around starter fountain pen. "
enventr,"August 17, 2017","Although the pen feels good in my hand. The ink doesn't flow properly. I have to
keep priming it over and over. Also I realized that I received a fine point when
I ordered a medium, unfortunately over the 30-day limit. I don't recommend the
fine point. "
perak1939,"July 5, 2016","The Pilot Metropolitan was my first fountain pen purchase. I encountered nib
problems from the outset, intermittent flow mostly. I think I have solved those
problems by tweaking the nib but I do not like this pen as much as others seem
to like it. The nib is too flexible for my hand. I prefer more resistance when
writing. And the medium nib is too fine for me (my fault for not doing more nib
comparisons). I know that it is recommended as a starter pen but I advise people
to go with the Platinum Preppy, a pen with which I have encountered no problems
whatsoever. "
cyrusdakota,"October 20, 2013","Nice pen with good fit and finish.The nib writes smoothly, but I have a couple of Sheaffer pens with fine nibs
that are smoother with a little more character. But these cost significantly
more.The pen also has good weight due to the metal construction.Overall, a good purchase. "
leebcgfx,"April 1, 2019","Bought the Med. and the Fine. Both do very well. I use them for art sketching,
not so much writing. But I found they write well too.I like them because the nib does not dry while capped for days between use. That
is a big thing with me.I really like the snap cap. The down side is that if you want a carry work pen,
this may not be it. It seems the cap comes off too easy for a shirt pocket.Mine are filled with Noodlers black. Bought a converter for each one."
Mohammad Abida,"March 19, 2019","This was my first purchase on JetPens, it is my daily writer alongside the Lamy
Safari. It is an amazing pen, and I was amazed by the its quality for such price
range. If you are a starter in fountain pens world, then the Metropolitan must
be in your collection, you won't regret it.But, there are two things to take into consideration:1) When choosing the nib size, please note that the nib sizes for the
Metropolitan are Japanese sizes, which are finer than the Western nib sizes
(actually, the Metropolitan medium nib is a little bit finer than the Lamy fine
nib).2) For the flex and calligraphy effect lovers: the Metropolitan has stainless
steel nib, it is NOT a flex nib, and it was not meant to be one. If you push too
hard on it, you'll end up with a broken pen.Thank you, JetPens, for the lovely order."
rkbry,"June 6, 2018","This is a nice pen, it's just not for me. It writes very smoothly and I never
had any issues whatsoever with the nib. For the price and the materials, it's a
great value.With that said, there are two things I really didn't like: first, the step-down
at the section is a bit severe for my taste. It wasn't comfortable for me to
hold. Second, with the pen posted, it was top heavy and the balance was too far
back. Still, I am giving the Metropolitan four stars because my complaints are
subjective, and I do recognize that it's a well-made pen sold at a great price."
jodie.marie,"May 29, 2017",Smooth writing.  Medium nib is quite fine.
yamashta,"January 25, 2017","I bought this pen alongside it's Fine Nib brother. Like the Fine Nib, it is a
good quality for it's price. The ink it comes with feathered a little on the
paper I used to test it on, but that's fine, I don't mind it. The nib size is
only subtly larger than the Fine Nib, and on a quick glance at two test
writings, it could easily be mistaken as the same nib size. No matter.The case is very beautiful, the design is sleek and handsome, and it is very
travel-friendly. I like it.My only complaint, and I am not including it in my star review as it may have
just been my own fault, is that it was VERY difficult to remove the neck from
the barrel to put the ink on. I did not have nearly as much trouble with my Fine
Nib as with my Medium Nib. Like I said, though, it may just be my own fault, or
a unique instance. I did manage to get it all set up in the end."
BLeeds,"November 28, 2016","I'​d like to make a couple comments about the Metropolitan. It's an
outstanding pen and I have two of them (my original order was the fine point but
I prefer the medium; I wish I had read JetPens' essay on Japanese nibs and their
tendency toward thinness before I ordered), and it is this pen that introduced
me to the world of fountain pens. And this new interest has not a little to do
with the great reviews at JetPens.I love the pen because of how smooth it is, but I continue to buy fountain pens
from JetPens, looking for the perfect fountain pen. The Metropolitan is close
but no cigar, pun not intended (shape).It falls short of being the perfect pen for me because, for me, it's top-heavy
with it posted; and without it being posted it's slightly short.The step down just above where you hold the pen is a very slight irritation. I
wish there were a smoother transition between the body of the pen and the place
where you hold it but this is not as big a deal as the top-heaviness and the
shortness issues. People complain about it being heavy which seems strange to
me. I would like it more unposted if it were heavier.This is a very strongly recommended fountain pen and for most people it may be
just right. However, with the shortcomings mentioned above I am going to keep
looking, and I suspect that one of the higher-end Pilot's will suit me better. I
just hope I find one that is as smooth as the Metro. I am going to order the
Elabo and the Platinum 3776 Century and a couple of Kawecos and a Parker Sonnet
and see how they fair. Who knows, the Metropolitan may stay at the top!If you have a recommendation for me given my love for the Metro please tell me. "
malozing0809,"March 21, 2020","The Metropolitan is my first fountain pen, and I love it. I have taken notes in
my college classes with this pen, written in my bullet journal, and written
several letters with it.It is a wet and smooth writer with light feedback. The section is easy for me to
hold onto, and its weight is great for long writing sessions. It is effortless
to clean when I want to switch out ink colors. I was also lucky enough to get the pen with the squeeze converter. My
understanding is that Pilot stopped including the converter with the pen. The pen has a beautiful classic look to it, and it doesn't draw too much
attention in my classes. The body is durable; I dropped it (capped) on my
driveway. It only suffered a scratch at the end of the body, and that is barely
noticeable. "

Tofu,"October 19, 2018","My very first fountain pen. Writing with this felt like it was gliding off
glass. No regrets with this purchase."
rakels133,"August 3, 2018","It writes incredibly smoothly, but the tip is quite fatter than I imagined. I
tend to write small so I think I will use this primarily for art rather than
writing like I wanted to. If you are wanting to use this for journaling or
writing in a small book, I would probably recommend the finer nib."
ADR in NY,"March 13, 2018","I'm new at fountain pens. I've tried Pilot, Kaweco, and Lamy pens thus far. A
good pen writes well; you get this with a Pilot fountain pen. Pilot nibs perform
the best as they haven't caused me any problems whatsoever, smooth flow across
paper and no hard starts or skipping.  So tired of the cheap pens purchased at
the office; great pen for use at work. While I'll use the Signo 207/307 when
signing documents, my Pilot fountain pen is used for all other writing. I also
like that Pilot pens come in a decent selection of body designs. I'm quite
satisfied with my purchase."

Tamra,"September 22, 2017","This pen is sooo smooth and beautiful! It comes in a very sleek carrying case,
though be careful, the plastic on it may pop out if you're not careful. This pen feels amazing, though. It lays ink down beautifully, its not too light
or too heavy. I would recommend going somewhat slow when writing or drawing with
it, as it skips easily if you are steadfast.Otherwise, I recommend this pen fully for a starter fountain pen.  "
gary.bowman,"August 16, 2017","Very pleased with my purchase.  The pen has a nice feel and weight in my hand,

tkgmalice,"April 9, 2017","a very nice pen, moves really fluidly , not very flexible (for line variation)
like i would have liked (im use to a g pen nib) but still very good and you can
get some line variance out of it by turning the nib upside down for really thin
lines.the ink cartridges are pretty good , i can do about 4 days of heavy drawing with
it before it ran out. great pen for the price . just make sure to get some ink cartridges with it a 12
pack should last a good while."

pens.  So now I have ordered a medium nib in this pen. Buy it without
hesitation."

been using the Namiki ink cartridges so far.  The ink flows very well and the
pen writes so well.  The medium nib size is just perfect for me.  I would highly
recommend this pen to anyone.  I hope to get a couple more and try different ink
colors with a converter.I didn't do anything to the pen out of the box.  I just inserted an ink
cartridge, let the ink get primed and started writing.  No issues from the
start.Highly recommend this pen."
carolecb,"December 2, 2014","I love this pen,but I put the Plumix Nib on the pen and then use it as a super

jiasterop,"November 17, 2014","This is the best fountain pen under $20. It looks nice, is light, and has great
ink flow. I never experienced any skipping with this pen with Noodler's black
ink. The body and cap of this pen is light enough that you can actually use this
pen with the cap posted. There is a ridge near the middle of the pen when the
cap is taken off that can bother some people that like to write with their hands
far from the nib. I should have waited a month for the fine nib version of this
pen to get released because the lines are a little too thick for me when I'm
writing on low quality paper."
Laura,"August 6, 2014","Just received this pen and I love it. Nice weight, writes well. A little finer
than I would expect a medium to be, but it's just fine.  I love that it comes
with a converter for bottled ink; this is a great deal!"
sjstromquist,"January 30, 2013","5+ rating. Thoroughly enjoy my new Pilot Metropolitan. As the previous reviewer
said, it writes amazingly well on cheap paper. I have no problems with it at all
- started with the enclosed cartridge and thinking about dumping it so I can try
some the converter with other inks.  It's comfortable to use - looked a little
wide but isn't when I hold it.  I am sure another will be added to my collection
soon. "

writes quite as well as my Lamy, but thats subjective and at most a very small
difference.  The main problem I have with it is I can't get much ink into the
squeeze refiller and I found myself having to refill it frequently. Maybe it's a
learned skill."
nbe726,"November 17, 2021","Very good pen, overall. This is my first fountain pen, and so I had some
difficulty at first, however it works quite well and I will continue to use it.
I had some trouble at first when trying to get it to put ink to paper, it almost
seemed like blind luck that the ink eventually ""left"" the pen, but this could be
how it always works with fountain pens and I wouldn't know the difference. I
would purchase again, and I recommend to other beginners."
ajdjr73,"November 3, 2021","Great pen. The cap is a pop off and not a screw off. The pen writes wonderfully

williamefendiev,"March 17, 2021","This was my first fountain pen, and I will say it is quite a enjoyable pen to

it still seemed quite fine but did not cause any fluid flow problems and the ink
provided seemed to dry fast as I am left handed and had no smear marks when
writing"

zwcm97,"June 12, 2019","TL;DR: If you're a beginner and thinking about buying this pen. Don't. Either
get a TWSBI Go, or save up and get an Eco for $10 more.We get it 'beginner pen'... Since when is a beginner pen all metal and 2-4x more
than entry level pens? You're paying $10 extra for metal... Why would you need
longevity and durability on a pen that you're just trying out? Here is a
beginner progression for pros: Preppy->Kakuno->TWSBI GoOn top of those points... The TWSBI Go really killed the relevance of this pen
at the price point. When I get an inexpensive fountain pen, I want either
novelty or convenience, not a premium material like metal. The TWSBI Go offers
both novelty and convenience in one, and highly outclasses this pen in it's
targeted roll. The main reason that the Go is such a good deal is because you
have this pen to compare it to... This pen is a solid pen, but it is a terrible
deal when you take the market into considerationThis pen sits in an awkward position, where it really makes no sense to get it.
If you're looking for a toes in the water pen that is better than a preppy, get
the Kakuno or an Al-star, a moonman, or a jinhao. At least for the Lamy you're
paying for the design aesthetic. The Kakuno has the same nib as the
metropolitan, and I find it to be a better pen in many ways. In the intermediate range, you have the TWSBI's which offer some really
interesting filling mechanisms that you only see in high end pens for only ~$10
more. If you are considering this pen, get your brain checked. Buy a TWSBI. -I'm
not shilling, it's just what makes sense for your wallet at the current time."

fairly medium stroke. We shall see how this medium nib looks."

a neat pen and I recommend it."
betolung,"October 28, 2014","This is my second Metropolitan Fountain Pen (I tried the fine nib first with the
Taupe body). It is also a very sleek sketching pen with a hefty brass barrel
suitable for daily use. Its medium nib delivered a bolder line with a steady ink
flow without skipping as I sketched and doodled loosely with it in every
direction at different drawing angles.  I used Platinum Carbon ink since I
prefer waterproof sketches that could be colored with watercolor and other
water-based media. The medium nib makes it suitable for sketching and drawing on
larger scale papers since the wider line will be clearly visible even on ledger
size 11"" X 17"" paper. I filled it with ink three weeks ago using a CON-50
converter, and I have been testing this pen on different journal papers from
time to time. I have found that the pen starts writing right away after a few
idle days, and that I can sketch swiftly without the line skipping. With the
fine nib pen, if I go too fast the thinner line might skip mid-stroke. Yet I
would recommend getting both pens for a more comprehensive ink sketching kit. It
makes for a great gift in its sturdy hinged-tin storage box with the aerometric
converter and spare ink cartridge which I have yet to try."
josh_harle,"May 30, 2013","Very good pen writes smooth. This is my first fountain pen,  already comes with

Btshails,"October 12, 2020","I do not like this pen. I want to say I think most of this is personal
preference in pens but since this is so highly recommended as a starter pen I
wanted add my thoughts for people with taste like mine. I will say the quality,
weight, and style of this pen is amazing for the price, it looks and feels good
in the hand. That however, is where my pros stop on this one, The squeeze
converter it comes with is a pain to use and lends itself to making a mess, and
the nib is just not at all right for beginer in my opinion. Coming as a relitive
fountain pen noobie when I got this pen I didn't know Japanese fountain pen nibs
are about a full size smaller that their american or european counterparts. I
would call this medium a fine almost leaning toward extrafine for some american
brands. If you like a smooth pen this is absolutely not the one for you,
tremendous feedback even on the smoothest high quality paper. If you like some
feedback and an extremely fine line this may work great for you but I think for
most newbies a slightly bigger, smoother nib is the best starting point."

owlesque5,"December 3, 2011","I think I'm in love with this pen. I'm a huge fan of the .25mm Slicci, and this
pen--this color in particular--gives it a run for its money. Ink flow is smooth,
pen is well-balanced, and the color is phenomenal. You know how a lot of purple
pens end up looking kind of fuchsia-ish? This pen, on the other hand, is a true,
deep, royal purple. I adore it. I also got the Black, Bordeaux Black, and Brown
Black, and I love them all for the same reasons (although the lavender black is
my favorite color). There is a noticeable difference between this .38mm line and
the Slicci's .25mm line, so I won't be using this one for extreme detail work,
but there's nothing wrong with having different instruments for different
purposes. Excellent pen!"
hatefulmoviecritic,"July 8, 2012","This is such a fantastic color. I favor the darker colors and this is my

schuitzacua,"June 17, 2012","Unique shade, smoothing writing like other Signo DX.  Too bad it does not have

Anonymous,"December 19, 2017","This is my favorite ink color!  I put the ink cartridges in other Uni Signo
bodies because I don't like that there are permanent bar codes on the bodies of
the lavender black pens (this has been the case from all retailers, including
buying a whole box of them internationally).  Compared to all the other colors
of Uni Signo .38s I have, all of the lavender blacks write a significantly
thicker line, like they were actually about a .45mm.  It would be perfect if
they came in needle-tip (though I wish all pens came in needle-tip).  Please
keep stocking this unique color!"
jina100,"February 25, 2016","Like the brown back and blue black, this lavender black is absolutely worth the
buy! I love all of the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 pens with the black ink mixed with
a color. They're good for taking notes when you want to highlight a word or
phrase but don't want it to stand out TOO much, like may happen with a
highlighter or a brighter color pen. I also like just writing with them as well,
especially in a planner or something, just to change it up.I would note that the lavender black, unlike the brown black or blue black,
really does have quite a bit of the purple show through (in my opinion). Thus,
while you may be able to get away with using the brown black - and definitely
the blue black - for 'official' work, I wouldn't necessarily recommend the
lavender black, as it can appear pretty purple-y."
mgonugun,"July 16, 2018","This deep purple is absolutely gorgeous and a nice alternative to black. The ink
flow is smooth and consistently thin, with very little bleeding, if at all. It
does skip very occasionally, but I believe that is more due to my writing style
- I tend to press fairly hard when writing, and this causes more noticeable
skipping in pens with smaller tips and lower ink flow. The color is very similar
to the Uniball Vision Elite BLX pen in Purple/Black - if you want a deep purple
color in a more inky, 0.5 mm pen, that's the one for you. I do wish they sold
refills in this ink color so I didn't have to order a new pen every time I run
out, but until then, new pens it is."
kris.adsit,"March 24, 2016","These are quite simply the best pens EVER!! No globs, no skips, just nice smooth

shades, but this shade comes out differently. I hope they'll have 0.5mm of this."
Halley,"March 5, 2021","I like the color - deep, cool toned purples are a favorite of mine. That being
said, the very fine point is uncomfortably scratchy AND this pen gives me some
globs of ink if I raise the point off the paper for a minute. Globs and
scratchiness makes this pen a decided ""meh"" for me. I don't hate it - but I
won't replace it when it runs out, either. "

are almost always a great choice. I have to confess that the needle nibs are my
favorites though. If they made needle versions of these colors I would buy those
in a heartbeat. "
moonstalker24,"October 9, 2020","I like this pen. Aside from the fact that the Uni-ball Signos are great every
day, hard wear use sort of pens, they have great ink in them. I like this one

in a 0.5mm tip."

dents my paper) and the ink does not flow like it should. I'm disappointed! I

purple-black ink that makes it not flow as flawlessly as the others."

take a moment to dry sometimes. "
jalmascok,"November 9, 2022","Giving this 5 stars for the beautiful color of ink despite one small flaw.
Really love the color of this ink!! Saturated dark purple, smooth and looks
great on paper. Small dislike is the grip is too high for my large hands that
hold pens tightly and close to the point- it’s too high. Otherwise brilliant!!
Great writing experience for smooth, clean with no clumps plus fun color!! Get
the set, every color is fantastic!! "
Goldiehawk,"September 21, 2022","Extremely fine point, but writes smoothly "

Will order again."
kzanol,"August 19, 2022","I really want to like this pen, it's great when you first start writing with it,
but after several days you can barely get any ink out of it, it's so faint. 
This has happened with multiple pens in different colors, so it wasn't just one
bad one."

amanda.zahn17,"April 25, 2022","I love this pen. I live the ink color, the smooth writing, and the thin point!I didn't think I would find something I loved more than Pentel Energel 0.5. This is certainly causing me to rethink who has my heart.I will be saving up to get all of the colors."
eremmylists,"April 23, 2022","I love this pen; I ordered 10 of them this time. It writes smoothly on a huge
variety of papers (including ones that my fountain pens hate), and both the
lavender-black color and .38 width are ideal for me. And the ink is
water-resistant (pigment-based), so you can highlight or watercolor over it. The
color is more violet than the ink in the violet-black Uni-ball Vision Elite pen,
which I thought was too drab---and that one was also a tad more purpley (I mean
more toward the red than the blue side)."
bushmichele88,"April 20, 2022","Love the unique color.  Dark moody shaded ink and smooth writing for doodling. 
Excellent for adding fine details. "
theway1Cor.13,"April 15, 2022","Love the color and the way the pen writes so smoothly with the fine tip enabling
me to write two, quite legible lines within one college width space of my spiral

doreenfleming,"April 11, 2022","My favourite pens, both the color and size. They never disappoint."
kmcd2121,"April 8, 2022","Such a nice color.  Dignified not frivolous.  As all Uni-ball Signos it is a
pleasure to write with.  When drawing I like to use it to change tone of shading
when working on shadows"
bunnycottage,"April 7, 2022","What is not to absolutely love about this glorious dark purple ink. These pens
are a delight to write with, the ink is smooth and the rubber grip lets you
write and write and write without feeling fatigue from having to grip the pen
too hard. "

R J B,"January 26, 2022","Nice consistent fine line, and this is a very nice shade of purple - dark,

Sean M,"January 11, 2022","Kind-of a workhorse for me. I use the UM-151 line constantly, from desk work to

jubileestreet,"January 3, 2022","Here was the reason for my order.  My Lavender Black pen was almost empty - and

debra84,"September 12, 2021","This pen was the main reason I finally placed an order at JetPens. It doesn't
disappoint. I often prefer larger nibs, but this pen took me bad to my neat and
tiny writing days after first getting ahold of my dad's ""fancy"" .5 mm mechanical

color really is gorgeous. I'll definitely order again."

janrichgmr,"February 20, 2021",okay but nothing special
Francesca,"February 4, 2021","I originally bought this off black colour along with two other off black
colours—Brown Black and Bordeaux Black—because of all the hype, the ooh, ah,
wow, surrounding these colours. Well…all these colours are richly pigmented
and vibrant. The ink is dark, but its base is clearly visible. I have no other
colour similar to the Lavender Black. The Bordeaux Black is similar to the Pilot
Juice Dark Red and Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel Vintage Bordeaux Purple. The Brown
Black is similar to the Pilot Juice Coffee Brown and Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel
Vintage Sepia Black. After trying these colours, I realized that one of each
wasn’t enough, so I bought more. The cap is easy to remove and snaps in place
satisfyingly. The cap can also be posted securely as there is a groove at the
end of the barrel for that purpose. The rubber grip is comfortable, and my
fingers don’t slide beyond it. All these three pens are very inky and none are
scratchy."

people too ( you know like old fashioned mail!!) perfect for both."
tatiyana_branco,"May 13, 2020","The color is more dark purple than anything - but definitely has that black
undertone. I am a huge fan of blue black ink, so I was hoping there would be a
subtle difference in the color from a naked eye seeing ""purple"" if that makes
sense. Nevertheless, beautiful pen - one of my favorites, I love it for
journaling because it's such a great pop of color. I think I have this gel pen
in 3-4 colors, I love the pen itself, no matter the ink color. The only downfall
for me, the reason why I don't reach for it AS often as my other favorites, is
that it's a capped pen ."

bqacos,"March 31, 2020","My preference is for either the super sharp tips in the 0.3mm range or your
everyday, buy-in-bulk pen tip size, whatever that is. If you're somewhere
inbetween, this this will definitely be the the pen for you!I purchased the Uni-ball Signo Gel Pen 0.28mm and 0.38mm. Before this I had to
PILOT HI-TEC-C 0.3mm. Of the 3, I prefer the 0.28mm, and the 0.38mm was my least
favorite. This is very much so based on the tip size.Skipping and StoppingHI-TEC-C Skipping was minimal. I never had issues with it stopping. Both of the Uni-balls would never skip. However had their moments where they
wouldn't write at all and it would take a lot of work to get ink flowing again.
Midway through the life of the pen I thought I was going to have to throw it
away, but after giving it some time it would start working again. This happened
4-6 times for the life of each pen.ResistanceThis gliding, or lack of resistance, is exactly what I don't like about the
0.38mm Signo. It made it too easy to get sloppy with my writing. I always get
accidental markings and carryover strokes. This is where the 0.28mm shines -
nice control and not-too-much resistance - but not to a point where its scratchy
like the HI-TEC-C. "

looks as professional as a blue or black ink.  I have about 5 and refuse to
share.  I truly wish they had a refill for this ink.  I will continue to buy
them.  They are one of my favorite go to pens and my every day carry.   "

I've taken pages of notes with it in a Leuchtturm and don't have a problem with
being able to read both sides of the page. "

helenviec,"January 14, 2018","I liked this pen more than I thought I would. I usually prefer using darker

incredible. "

vchukhray,"December 28, 2017",Beautiful color. Writes very easily.
luke,"December 22, 2017","I love the ink color. The pen is simple in design and functional as a daily
writer. Writing is smooth, consistent and clean. The line thinness at .38 mm is
perfect for those who tend to write small, such as myself. The cap posts and
clicks into place but is strange being that it is small and not what you may be
used to. It still feels secure enough."
mnemosyne5,"December 20, 2017","I love this pen.  The color is exactly what I was hoping it would be, very dark,
a nice purple.  The Uni-ball Signo gel pens have long been a favorite of mine as
they are smooth, consistent writers and comfortable to hold.  This color though
is a definite favorite."
wendellxe,"November 7, 2017","I like a really dark royal blue, as red as you can get while still being
unmistakably blue. I heard the Lavender Black could look blue, so I checked it
out. Nope. In good lighting, at least, it is definitely not blue. On a good
paper with hard sizing, it looks like a dark violet. On cheap paper that allows
more ink to soak in, it looks nearly black. Only in a low-light situation, if
you don't look closely, can it give an initial impression of a very dark blue.
It's a classy color, a subtle divergence from the standard black ink."
simmo.04,"November 5, 2017",Excellent feel for such a fine line and a great range of colours.
dust.massey,"November 4, 2017","I do love these pens. They are probably the best writers I have. As simple as
they are, they are my top performers. Uni-ball knows their stuff.. The .38 is

I was very hesitant about the .38 mm tip because I've had not so great
experiences with such fine points before and so avoided them. My go to size was
.7 and I only recently started liking .5 but I really liked thsi .38. It was not
at all scratchy and no feedback. It wrote smooth and the pen itself feels nicer
than other gel pens I normally use (i.e Pilot G2 or Pilot Juice)."

sealkat6,"May 30, 2017","This is a great gel pen. A very smooth experience and easy to use for extended
hours of note-taking. I love the dark shade - an unusual colour. Whether I find
it a better pen than the Pilot Hi-Tec C 0.38 or 0.4 is a very difficult
question. The pens are noticeably different but extremely good. The Signo has
the advantage of a slightly cushioned grip that is comfortable and this may be a
big selling point for some people."
penreviews,"May 4, 2017","Hands down one of the best pens I've ever used!!! The ink flows so smoothly, it

with a hint of purple."

as not to be obnoxious or adolescent."
Athena PN,"March 6, 2017","GORGEOUS dark blue-purple in a fine line pen that doesn't clog or spot. I use
this with my Purple Leuchtturm 1917 planner, which it matches almost perfectly,

restricted space allowed in a planner quite legibly. I do wish it were
refillable and/or that it carried a bit more ink, but those are minor quibbles.

jeannelaurel,"November 12, 2016","I've bought a second round because I like these so much. The word ""lavender"" may
be misleading, as the ink is dark, with just enough purple showing through to
help distinguish from black ink. Smooth and precise writing. My go-to grading
pen (because I really don't like bleeding red ink all over student papers, and
they sometimes write such small, crabbed script--nobody teaches cursive
anymore--that I really have to get into nooks & crannies to comment.)"
esen10,"November 1, 2016",Perfect output and color. Writes smoothly. 
luckie,"September 13, 2016","Beautiful color, perfect writing size."
chaservie,"September 1, 2016","This pen is mentioned many times on a podcast I listen to, the Pen Addict, and
out of curiosity, I ordered one.  I prefer a finer point, 0.5 or smaller so
figured at least I wouldn't hate this.  I fell in love with it before I finished
writing out my first test sentence.  It writes so nicely.  Crisp neat lines.  No
skipping.  Some pens when they get to the finer end of the tip size can feel
scratchy or give a more tactile experience when I writing, but I found this pen
to glide nicely over the paper.  I'm already planning on order the larger set of
all the colors or putting it on my gift list for Christmas.I really like the purple too.  I was curious how a lavender black would look. 
It makes me think of eggplants.  That dark rich purple color than can almost
appear black, but not quite.  Very lovely.  I can't wait to try the other colors
out."
Eckert,"August 3, 2016","The color is quite dark, but still very purple. Too purple to get away with
using it on office work, but definitely a new favorite along with the other
color-black pens Uni-Ball offers. I've been using this one for general
note-taking and even journaling, it compliments the green-black (my favorite of
the 5) of the same brand very well."

EdwardDillinger,"July 6, 2016","You know how the ink in the purple-black 207 isn't very purple? Not a problem
with this pen. It's dark, but it's definitely tinted, and not the dull,
barely-there color available in the 207; it's much richer. One point to consider
if you have tiny handwriting, though: the line is slightly thicker in this color
than in the violet .38, and seems to flow a bit more freely... maybe too freely.
Which is a plus if you don't really need a tiny line, I suppose. It certainly
feels nice to write with, and the line isn't any thicker than it is in regular
black in this size."

ladysekhmetka,"May 6, 2016","I got four of these, in different colors, and this color is my favorite color by
far. I religiously guard these pens from other people, that's how nice these
pens are. A wonderful .38 point, but it doesn't scratch the paper and writes
smoothly. Only 'downside' is that this style of pen comes with a cap. I would
prefer a capless, 'clicking' pen, but I've not been able to find this dark shade
of purple in that style."
Annette,"March 4, 2016","These are great pens: precise without being scratchy. They are my go-to pen now

overwhelming, but the pen itself functions beautifully, like that of a very
expensive pen. I will definitely be snagging more colors."

to have a purple pen that isn't quite purple. My only complaint, and I think I
just got a bad pen, is that it skips terribly. It will write well for a few
lines, then start skipping and scratching at the paper. It's a bit of a

would get it again."

and they are still better than the old school ballpoint erasable pens I used a
long time ago. What I never loved about the frixions is that the ink was not
very vibrant. These are the most vibrant/potent ink I have experienced with
frixion. It looks more like regular gel ink than the other frixion pens. If you
don't mind the smaller point and are still looking for an erasable pen,
definitely give these a try. I use these for my college calculus notes and they
do run out a little faster. I have already replaced the black ink and I've had
the pens for about 3 weeks. "
greyfluff,"April 2, 2020","I LOVE these pens. I've been a fan of Pilot FriXion pens for years, but I like
fine points, and the 0.7mm pens, while lovely, are not as fine as I like. These
are perfect. The ink glides smoothly and evenly, so they write beautifully. The
0.4mm tips are perfect for those who like fine point pens, and, of course, the
ink is erasable. I love these pens so much that I have bought a second set so
that I always have a set with me at home or in the office."
bspringstubbe,"October 13, 2021","I had planned to wait until I began using my 2022 planners to start using these
pens, but I'm glad I didn't. They are lovely. I have been using the Frixion
Point pens with the caps for the last few years, and while I really like them, I
love these FriXion Point Knock pens. I prefer the heavier body of this pen. They
write smoothly and dry quickly enough for me. The colors are vibrant, and the
point is fine enough to write comfortably in my B6 Slim Jibun Days. I also
appreciate that these pens are refillable, making them more environmentally
friendly than many other choices."
moth,"September 19, 2021","Perfect for fine, detailed, precise work. The caveat for anyone in a hot climate
is anything written with these will fade out (or disappear entirely) if left in
the sun, and the ink itself isn't a dark/saturated as a non-erasable equivalent;
the black in particular is more of a dark grey."

individually. These are my favorite Frixion pens for using with my Rocketbook -
the 0.5mm are a little thicker than I like and the 0.38 are a little too fine to
scan well, and in spite of what the math might imply, the line thickness of the
Point Knock 04's are right in the middle. My only complaint is that I wish some
of the colors only available as 0.38 were in this size! (If anyone from Pilot is
reading this, please add the Wine, Violet, and Brown)"

Almost right,"January 16, 2021","I have these pens in multiple colors and chose them because they came in a 0.4mm

so hoping this would fit my needs as I don't really like 0.5mm and larger

blgollnick,"September 25, 2012","Here's a little-known fact about the Lamy 2000: for whatever reasons, this pen
is relatively leak-proof at altitude. So while I wouldn't WRITE with it in an
airplane, you actually can (and I have) travel with a partially full 2000 and
not end up with a cap (or pocket) full of ink. A little extra design perk. Few
fountain pens pass this test unless they are specifically designed to resist
changes in air pressure."
red251410,"August 2, 2012","The Bauhaus-inspired Lamy 2000 piston-filled fountain pen has been in continuous
production since it was introduced in 1966, but it actually contains elements,
including the nib size and shape, of earlier Lamy piston-filled pens, most
notably the Lamy 27.  This top-of-the-line Lamy fountain pen is very well-made
and handles beautifully.  It is lightweight, being made mostly of matte-textured
Makrolon, a mixture of fiberglass and plastic resin (not fiberglass and
stainless steel, as mentioned in the JetPens description), complemented with a
brushed stainless steel hooded section.  The Lamy 2000 was the very first
writing instrument to feature a solid, stainless steel, articulated
(spring-loaded clip) that adapts nicely to any pocket thickness.  The Lamy 2000
extra-fine nib is not as narrow as a typical Japanese nib, and it might be
considered closer to what most people would think is a fine-width nib.  However,
Lamy 2000 nibs are smooth writers, and the L2K feed has excellent flow. The
piston-filler mechanism works very well and will provide years of excellent
service.  If necessary, for cleaning or repair, the “L2K” can be easily
dismantled and reassembled without tools.  Also, Lamy USA can supply some
replacement parts and customer service is excellent.  Please note that, although it slides onto the feed like other Lamy nibs, the
Lamy 2000 nib is a different size and shape when compared to the
Safari/CP1/Accent/AL-Star-type nib."
lantarlassi,"August 24, 2016","I love this pen. I bought both the EF and the F nib versions, because I had read
that the EF was closer to the F for the rest of Lamy pens, and I was upgrading
from a Studio Fine that have loved as my sole fountain pen and daily writer for
five years. The verdict is that with moderate pressure, the Lamy 2000 EF and Lamy Studio F
are about the same, however, the 2000 EF is more sensitive to pressure and gets
considerable variation in line width. The Lamy 2000 F, however, is pretty much
exactly like the Studio F, and I notice a similar near-absence of line width
variation. The F nib is smoother writing, and tolerates different hand angles
better, so for daily use and notes, I'm using the F. For letters I've started
using the EF, because the line is so wonderful. Extremely happy with my Lamy pens. "
Cheri P,"January 24, 2014","I love this pen. I started with a Lamy Safari and soon graduated to this pen -
while I liked the Safari, the Lamy is simply a whole different writing
experience. It's smooth, smart, lays a solid line. Less trouble with starts
after being uncapped (my Safari was unusable at work due to this, but my 2000 is
a GREAT work pen....). So far I haven't had any bad inks (my Safari doesn't like
the Diamine inks... it gets all crusty.... but they're fine in the 2000).  It sounds cheesy, perhaps - but writing is such a pleasure with this pen. It
feels like an indulgence each time I post the cap and start my writing session.
 If I lost my pen, I'd buy a new one. Only thing to be aware of: don't damage the tip! I dropped it on a cement floor
tip down and bent the nib - cost nearly $90.00 to have the nib replaced. Not a
cheap fix, but cheaper than a new pen. The fault wasn't the pen's - but my
butterfingers taught me a lesson about being more careful...."
rstrax,"March 21, 2013","While the Lamy 2000 is a modern looking and well made pen, the nib is a problem
for me. The extra fine nib is much wider than one would expect - at least a
fine, maybe a fine-medium width. It is also more flexible compared to Safari and
other Lamy nibs. This also contributes to wide lines. While I like the
appearance of the pen, and the history behind it, I just don't like to write
with it. It basically sits in my pen box on display."
theoddcopy,"January 6, 2017","I've owned a few cheaper fountain pens over the years but I wanted to take the
plunge into something a bit nicer. Came into some money for Christmas and had my
sights set on something in the $70 range... and then I bought this Lamy 2000
instead.Such a good decision! The pen writes beautifully. It fits in my hand perfectly
(I wear a size medium golf glove if that gives you an idea of size), and I can
write for a long time with no fatigue. I filled it with Pilot Iroshizuku Asa-Gao and it comes out wonderfully. Not too
wet, not too dry. Easy to fill, and it holds plenty of ink. As some say, the sweet spot is a bit tough to find at times, but even when
you're not on it this thing writes really, really well. Buy this pen. Find a good ink. Write and write and write. "
neeman,"December 21, 2016","The Lamy 2000 proves that quality pens are worth the moneyStylish and well madeA good lookerA superb smooth writerThe nib is on the wet side but dry enough to show an expressive line variation
and flourish with the normal change of hand pressureI do not find that the nib has a sensitive sweet spot, therefore the pen can be
held easilyThe pen is comfortable to hold and has a high ink capacityI am very pleased with this pen"
randumbum,"December 4, 2017","Why did I wait so long to buy this?  Truly a wonder to write & draw with. 
Buttery smooth, even with the EF nib, just like all the satisfied customers
before me have reviewed.  The nib is larger than the Safari EF, but that's what
nearly every reviewer states about this pen. Such a wet writer too; I am glad
the piston fill is such a large capacity.  Would recommend."
thomas.campanis,"July 22, 2021","This was my second fountain pen after spending a lot of time with the Lamy
Studio Lx all Black in Extra Fine. This nib confused me at first but after I
figured it out it became a favorite. I have the Extra Fine in the 2000 as well.
The nib is more like an Architects Nib or a Naginata Togi nib. When you get the
hang of it you can make those beautiful EF lines with a steeper angle of the pen
to paper and bring it down slightly to give your writing a nice variation.Great ink flow on the wet side and would recommend using German inks because of
this. I have found that this pen bleeds a lot if you put a Sailor ink into it.I ran it for awhile with Pelikan Edelstein Olivine and it writes beautifully.Great materials and brilliant design. That's what attracted it to me in the
first place."
Maple,"April 21, 2021","I'm not sure why I was intrigued by the look of this pen, modern and masculine,
which is not at all how I am.  Maybe for variety?  But I was right--it's lovely
to look at.  I was dubious about the nib since Safaris have never worked well
for me, but this one is incredible--perfect wetness, does not clog (really does.
not. clog. !), and its smooth and elegant on paper.  My EF is really closer to
an F, but when that bugs me, I flip it over and get a surprisingly smooth EF
line.  My one problem, and it's a significant one, is the grip.  Yes, smoothness
is a nice design feature, but this pen is really hard to grip!  It slips right
through my fingers.  Either I have to grip it in a death-hold, or--I kid you
not--I have to put sticky medical tape on it.  Otherwise, I'm wrestling with it
the whole time.  So I'm all for the modern, clean-line aesthetic, but not to the
point of ridiculousness.  If anyone has suggestions for Slippery Pen Syndrome,
let me know!  "
zschr355,"February 15, 2021","A near perfect pen. I wish only that the nib were more fine, but it’s in line
with other EF Lamy nibs so I wasn’t surprised. It writes smooth as silk, has a huge tank, and looks sleek in a pocket or in a
hand. Would recommend. "

the like. Very comfortable to write with. Extra-fine is a bit broader than
Japanese fines however. I'm happy with the line width even so."

alperuzer,"August 4, 2017","It is a must have pen for all fountain pen lovers. I tend to be write very small

recommended, if you take good care of it will probably outlast you :) "
ron e,"April 29, 2017","This is a great edc  pen. It disassembles very easily to clean. Writes very

replaced with a perfect pen. The Lamy control issues would be my only caveat
here. 4 stars. Possibility for 5 if no issues. "
Winter,"December 6, 2021","This is a wonderful pen. Gorgeous, very comfortable, very well-made, and a
delight on the page. Absolutely my favorite pen right now!"
vet4cow,"August 23, 2021","This pen was on my wish list for a long time, and happy it is now in my hand! It
does write a bit on the wet side (using LAMY Blue Black Ink), but writes very
smoothly.  It is comfortable in the hand, and is a good size not being too large
or too small. I have not felt that there is a sweet spot that needs to be
""found."" I am glad I purchased the extra fine nib, which is just slightly finer
than the fine nib on my LAMY Safari. Glad I finally made the plunge!"

eunicetheasian,"April 26, 2014","I love the Pilot Frixion pens, especially the 0.38 mm, but the ink runs out VERY
fast. I went through 3 refills in 2 weeks."
marygaby_93,"March 17, 2016","These pens are awesome, adorable and really good to use. The ink erases cleanly!
It also has space for a keychain charm, super adorable. The only reason i'm
giving this one 2 stars is because of the surprisingly low amount of ink it came
with - it ran out about a week ago after moderate use. I'm not sure what's going
on, but that's why im only giving this two stars. "
ewcain,"October 30, 2013","These pens are a great concept, they erase beautifully and are comfortable to
hold. I used these for physics class and found them to be nice for writing in
units, etc. Since I was writing on a note book they wrote alright since there
was a stack of paper below. However over all I have been unhappy with it. The
black is very faded not nice and dark like most pilot pens, and the my purple
one just quit working the other day and won't write any more( Only been using it
for like a week). If writing on a piece of paper just sitting on a hard surface,
I think they feel a bit scratchy. This is probably attributed to the extra fine
point however. All in all pilot makes some excellent pens, however I don't
particularly care for this line, maybe I will give them another shot in a larger
tip size to give them a fair chance. For only 3.00 if you want to try this pen,
it isn't very expensive, so don't let me influence you too much."
Asclepius,"March 28, 2013","So I have previously been using the Hi-Tec-C pens in the .25mm size because I
love the precision that they offer. When I decided to purchase this pen, I was
skeptical because it was bigger and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get
the same precision...boy was I wrong! Not only is this pen incredibly precise,
it just glides along the paper without any problems whatsoever. The Hi-Tec-C's,
however, do tend to be a bit scratchy. Oh yeah, and this pen is erasable!!! It's not your ordinary erasable ink either,
this type of ink is much better! I only hope that jetpens gets more of the other
colors back in stock soon, because I absolutely need to buy the red one ASAP! Please restock soon!!"
fyang011,"October 23, 2013","I bought this and the 0.4 blue Frixion pen. I thought I'd like the 0.4 one more
but I wanted to give these a try. I'm actually starting to like these more.
They're really convenient and easy to have on hand and not scratchy at all."
xgracek,"December 2, 2015","The ink in this pen isn't true black, more of a deep grey, but the erasable
function is priceless and it is plenty dark enough to be legible. "
hommydc2,"May 23, 2019",Excellent pencil replacement. Great for note taking. Erases with no trace.
Lsart,"May 18, 2019","These are very good and interesting pens. So cool that they erase effortlessly
and completely."
glad wise,"September 22, 2020","These dry out too quickly. I've purchased about 5-6 of them and maybe after a
few weeks they end up drying out and skipping constantly. It's not like I'm
writing too much or keeping them in the wrong temperature or anything. I have
other Frixion pens and those have all worked out much better. "
Lefties r cool,"July 14, 2020","I love this pen!!! It erases without a trace! (Or annoying little eraser fibers
for that matter) Good for someone who wants to write with a pen, but doesn't
want to worry about making mistakes. The ink does fun out a little fast, and
refills are a little expensive, (4.90 for three) but that's worth it for the
best eraseible pen EVER! The ink color is a little light, but it's just about
the same color as a classic bid pen. Over all, I just plain love it!"
princess cordelia,"June 29, 2020","the ink is a bit gray. other than that, it's great. "
kc.fairchild,"May 16, 2019","Honestly, I'd give these five stars because I love them. I ordered two black
pens (one for myself and one for my daughter to try) and I loved the one black
pen so much I ordered the pack of all colours. Unfortunately, the second black
pen was dry/the ink didn't work. Admittedly, a little frustrating but I suppose
it happens. Otherwise, I do like the pens and use them daily. They have a thin
tip so are good for writing on planners or small block calendars. The all
colours pack is nice if you are into colour coding your planner or calendar as I
do and you don't get the bleed through like with other ink pens as it has more
of a gel/ball point type of coverage. "
merckart,"January 23, 2019","These are the greatest pens.  My manager brought me back some from Japan and
though they are not my main pen (fountain pen), I use them for all of my
planners, calendars, etc. where items might change and need correcting.  They
write beautifully and I enjoy all the different colored inks that are available.
 They erase perfectly from any type of paper and fit into very slim planner
loops and feel very good while writing with them.  I never go anywhere without
them and I keep spares at all times."

masher023,"July 3, 2018","Good idea interesting execution. The Pilot FriXion Ball Slim Gel Pen - 0.38 mm -
Black seemed like the perfect thing for me, as a student i prefer pens to
pencils and i find myself always crossing stuff out because i can't erase it.
when i found Pilot FriXion Ball Slim Gel Pen - 0.38 mm - Black it seemed like
the perfect to my problem. When i received it however, the pen was extremely
scratchy almost to the point of not being able to use it, now i love .38 and
even .28mm tip sizes and I've never had a problem with their scratchyness but
this one was unbearable. Also the ink was very lite almost like a lite grey
certainly not black.  also i had a lot of trouble with railroading and just
plain old ink not coming out. I've been a stationary guy for awhile and own
around 200 pens and I've never had more trouble with a gel pen. i would not
recommend, however what i would recommend as an alternative is the Pilot FriXion
Point 04 Gel Pen - 0.4 mm - Black this one i love and continue to use today."
Writes in Melanin,"July 3, 2018","Nope. It's not black. It's a gray--much like the color of an HB pencil. And I
did everything. Scribbled, put it in the freezer overnight, writing over what I
wrote. But, nope. It does erase, though, for what it's worth. Otherwise, it's
not worth it. I've only tried the black, so I don't know about the other colors in the .38mm
slim lineup. I have tried the .7mm in all the colors, and those are inky and
vibrant. "
James,"March 27, 2018","I love these pens very much! I had absolutely no issues with them besides the
lifetime of the ink. You should expect around 1-2 months of ink until you’ll
have to replace it. "
Henry,"March 21, 2018","I adore this. I was worried about these because of bad experiences with other
erasable pens, but these aren't even in the same league. They erase flawlessly,
even over the same spot multiple times. One of my new favorites!"
Jessica,"February 2, 2018","Super, super slim writing tip, which is perfect for writing in my A6 planner. I
do wish it had a clip, though :/"
helenviec,"January 14, 2018","I really like using this pen to take notes because of how thin the tip is. The
eraser tool is really useful for when you make mistakes, and I especially enjoy
the fact that there are no annoying eraser shavings. ;)"
Myrima,"January 12, 2018","The pen wrote smoothly. Lines are thin. The slim case makes it easy to carry
around without bulking out a day planner. "
ngc,"December 11, 2017","this pen is so good but it runs out of ink so fast:( i just purchased 3 refills

thought it was going to be and it was more of a graphite color. that didn't turn
me away though i though it was quite an interesting color."
Rosalie Carrier,"August 25, 2017","The fact that you can erase it (it erases very well too) is cool, although it
writes in a sort of gray-ish rather than black, which is kind of disapointing"
pinickyfickles,"July 12, 2017","Well, the erasing works great but the ink didn't last through a week of one
sided, barely a single page a day use. :("
jillian.evansstrong,"July 11, 2017","i love this pen for its functionality, as it writes as smoothly as a normal gel
pen and erases with ease, but one should note that it is NOT opaque black; it's
more of a watery dark gray, which from afar, does look black. this isn't a super
big problem for me, since i use it solely for writing in my planner, but it
could be for some."

smithak126,"September 21, 2016","I LOVE these pens! They're practically the only ones I use right now because
they're perfect for taking class notes and study guides: great colors, fine tip,
and no scribbling out errors or crooked lines. My only criticism is that the ink does run out really fast. I have to restock
pretty much every month, which is annoying and can get pricey. If Pilot would
fix that, I'd probably be sold for life. "
kiaramenjivar1993,"August 31, 2016","this pen is great for note taking and i rarely need to use pencil when im in

Ming,"July 28, 2015","Honestly, as soon as it arrived and I tried it out, I fell in love with this
pen. I love .38mm pens but I just liked how the pen itself looked and felt. And
the eraser is fantastic! It completely erases all residue. The black ink is a
little faded, just like what a previous reviewer had said. Sometimes while
reviewing notes, it almost fooled me into thinking it was a pencil. (If you look
at it from a distance, haha.) Unfortunately, the other reviewers were right in
that the ink runs out incredibly fast. I finished the pen in about two weeks. I
used it everyday in math class and I was sad to see how fast the ink went out.
I'm giving it a 4/5 because of how nice it is, but if the ink didn't run out so
quickly, it definitely would have been a 5/5 for me. "

nobobo,"April 10, 2015","I had been using one of the US releases of the Pilot FriXion pen before buying
this, but the eraser getting covered when the pen was capped made it a pain to
use. This retractable version is much more convenient, and it's what I carry in
my bag now. The slim body feels nice in my hand and I prefer the finer tip.
Because of the ink's properties, I only use it for throwaway things like grocery
lists and crossword puzzles.The ink's more grey than black, but I don't write anything serious with it so
that's not a big issue with me. It is incredibly scratchy on rough paper as
well, so keep that in mind."

needs every time!"
mike h,"January 7, 2015","These are my go-to pens for all math and diagram-heavy work where small
corrections are very common.  For that, they have replaced all permanent-ink
pens like the zebra sarasa, the pilot high-tec-c and the signo rt-1.  They are
also much better for this than their 0.5 and 0.7 mm cousins; the thin grip works
surprisingly well for my large hands."

zeldeenee,"November 2, 2014","I LOVE PILOT FRIXION.Especially these skinnier, almost needle point pens here. This particular black

SirPilotTimeTravel,"August 2, 2013","I really enjoy this pen because it write very smoothly and erase cleanly. Also
it is small enough to take anywhere. However, I don’t know how to refill it

and I would advise people to buy it. Awesome!!  "
frencha,"July 24, 2013","These are really pretty great.  I own Frixions in all available tip sizes, and
these are my second favorites (the .5 ball knocks are the best for me).  These
are really nice pens - they write smoothly, the ink is pigmented, and they erase
cleanly.  Be warned, though, that these are very slim and short, almost like a
Slicci, and I know some people take issue with those.   Basically, if you need an extremely fine-tipped erasable pen for your planner,
you can't go wrong with these."
DanielleyJay,"June 6, 2013","I was skeptical about this pen when I first purchased it. All I can say after
using this is that I must buy another! The eraser works so well, NOT like those
old school bic eraser pens that leave residue. These are amazing. They are very
fine and the circumference of the pen is very small. Really great for small
writing. I will definitely be purchasing another. "

cecilia,"June 30, 2021","The ink isn't very dark, but it flows well and erases cleanly. Since the

I may invest in a more expensive one of this type."
memetzgz,"December 13, 2020","Another great pen for lefties.  If you need a super fine point, this is your

Frixion .4 - not quite as fine a point, but the barrel is normal sized."

find them difficult to grasp. Loses a point because the ink does run out fast.  Personally I love the deep grey/pale black ink, especially for course notes,
which IMO is where the ball slim gel pen shines. I can write faster than with a
pencil, but don’t have to draw diagrams perfectly or get spellings right at
high speed during lectures. "

tfgallegos,"August 16, 2020","Review for 038. This product is nice enough.  It puts down a very fine line. The
pen body is very thin. Too thin for grasping naturally with my not that big
hands. This makes it difficult to write more than a sentence here and there. On
paper the line is ok, though the black ink is greyish at best. The eraser does
erase. I used it with a Rocketbook for a few days but switched to a more
substantial size (0.7) after the app struggled to transcribe from the scan. I
can’t  help but wonder if it was the faintness of the line. Problem is mostly
remedied with 0.7 pen. Content was not identical, but similar. "

jp70,"May 19, 2020","Nice pen, but I prefer the 0.5 mm. I like the thinness of the 0.38 more than the
0.5, but the 0.5 writes a lot smoother. Plus, the 0.38 pen body is so thin that
it isn't comfortable to write with, especially for long periods of time."
YellowPickles21,"March 28, 2020","I was so excited to buy this pen. My handwriting is PERFECT when I use really
REALLY thin pens, so when I heard that Pilot made a SILM version of their
FriXion line, I rushed to buy this pen. This was also a great opportunity to
actually own one of their FriXion line. When it arrived, I immediately started
writing with it. At first, the ink was a faded grey, ok.....maybe it was just
the tip of the ink cartage. I began writing more and figured out that the ink
was more of a grey than a black so I was extremely disappointed. I used the
eraser that came with it, but found out that it only smeared the ink(you have to
really press hard on it). I tried to use it for notes(on Kokuyo Campus Semi-B5
lined paper) but found my handwriting to be horrific. The ink is surprisingly
wet and seems more like water than actual ink(I guess that's because it's
erasable). I got the black so I cannot say if the colors are actually what they
are suppose to be. This product was a great disappointment.XD uwu"
animekiller045,"February 4, 2020","This is a great pen, however since it is very slim it's not comfortable to write

maggie k,"November 5, 2019","I love this pen so much. It's the perfect size, and the FriXion technology with
erasing AND not smudging is amazing.However, it ran out faster than any other pen of quality I've purchased. Will it

these and not the one in the metal case."

wish the ink was a shade or two darker, but you can’t have it all. "
TKim,"October 16, 2019","Overall I'm enjoying this pen and the main reason I got it was due to the fact
it was erasable.  I have used this pen for less than 2 weeks and have had to
replace the ink twice already).  I also don't like the fact that as the ink runs
out the lines get very thin and hard to read whereas when it's a new cartridge,
the lines are actually quite thick so I can see in my bullet journal when the
ink was beginning to run out and when I had to replace the ink.  I see myself
using this for the bullet journal but don't plan right now on purchasing any
more of these pens."

clubjc3,"October 31, 2018",The ink skips a lot. 
Severo,"October 25, 2018","VALUE and EXECUTION:These pens are above average in terms of concept and execution, and I do enjoy
them. However, as others have mentioned, the ink runs out surprisingly quickly.
I'm a fountain pen user, so I'm not shocked when a pen runs out of ink, but I
expected that, since this is a gel ballpoint, it would be at least a few months
before that happened. Unfortunately, after about 16 days of moderate use, the
ink that the pen came with ran out completely. The pen does perform as
advertised, though, and the ink erases cleanly and completely. The pen itself is great value, but the single refills are a bit up there in
price for me. Pilot seems to be pushing for people to purchase the better-value
three packs, which is probably a good idea if you use this pen often. That being
said, I have already purchased compatible refills for this item, as well as the
larger FriXion Knock, as I prefer these pens far over pencils when I need
erasability. WRITING EXPERIENCE:The ink is not as black as it could (it looks more like dark pencil) be and
almost feels watery/slippery. This is not too unexpected considering the main
selling point of this pen; it can only be expected (however unfortunately) that
thermo-sensitive ink has a different composition, and thus, feeling, than
standard gel pens. I'm not sure if it's because of the fineness of the line or the ink or a
combination of the two, but there is some definite scratchiness when writing. I
had no problem ignoring it, but if you like your pens to feel smooth and soft,
this guy isn't going to give you what you want. OVERALL:I personally enjoy this pen, but it has a few characteristics that be
deal-breakers for many people and which make it difficult to wholeheartedly
recommend. By far the most prominent of these is the speed at which the ink is
used and the cost of the refills. But if you're interested, think it may be a
good candidate for your arsenal, and have a few bucks to spare (or are looking
for something to tip you over that free shipping mark) go for it. "

SarahLee,"April 14, 2018","Fabulous pen to get introduced to the FriXion pen line. Super slim, yet
comfortable. Only minor downside is that there's no grip, so if you have sweaty
hands(like me!) then you might have to take breaks and wipe your hands against
something. The ink erases so well. I was doubtful at first, but pleasantly surprised!
Definitely recommend trying it out and I'm going to be purchasing the other
colors in the future"
TheAuthorGuy,"April 12, 2018","These are very interesting. If you haven't used them, the ink isn't as black as
an art marker or gel pen, more about the darkness of a hard pencil BUT the
erasing is brilliant. The best erasable ink I've used. I don't actually know
what I'll use it for, but right now it would serve in place of a mechanical
pencil with a very clean eraser (there is no dust from the eraser). Fine line,
about the same pressure required as an equivalent ballpoint or hard pencil. No
pocket clip, but it's very narrow and has a hole for a string. "

kettu,"February 27, 2016","I absolutely loved this pen, I did expect the lighter ink. I love the size and

technology the ink disappears with heat. I live in an extremely hot environment
where the average summer day is 120 F, and after leaving my notes written with
this pen in my car the ink completely disappeared. I do recommend this if you
live in a moderate or cooler climate, and if you do run into the same problem I
do just put your note/paper into the freezer for quite awhile and the ink will
come back, but very muted in color."

Timla,"October 21, 2015","I would give this a 4.5, but since I can't, I just went with 5.These slim pens are aesthetically nice, easy to use, and nice and thin.Only con I have is that they skip occasionally. It can be a bit annoying. With
more use comes less skipping, however.This particular color, black, is pretty black, but could be more saturated. It's
not grey, but it could be darker.The ""eraser"" on these is very nice, nicer than the ""eraser"" on the markers. It
erases very quickly, easily, and cleanly. I've noticed that it helps to let the
ink dry a bit before erasing, however.Overall, these are nice pens. If they didn't skip, they'd be perfection.
However, the convenience of their FriXion qualities outweighs the inconvenience
of occasional skips for me. Whether or not you'll like these depends on your
priorities."
Jaslyn,"September 23, 2015","I genuinely love the Frixion line from Pilot but this one is a miss for me. The
ink is more of a grayish black and I already see a bit of ""railroading"" in the
first few days of using it. The ink ran out in less than a week! And during that
time, the eraser started to shed this weird dust that left gray smudges on my
paper and damaged it too. I definitely won't be buying it again, not even for a
fraction of the cost. I bought it together with some Uni-ball signo pens (0.38mm
too) and those pens are precise, write smooth and have beautiful ink colors, but
best of all, they last for weeks."
kookylaski,"August 26, 2015","It is an erasable pen and it's really slim to work with! I'm not too happy with

still easy to read. "
NSmith,"May 18, 2015","Nice pen, ink a little scratchy."
Mandasmac,"April 18, 2015","I don't understand why everyone is so crazy about this pen. I didn't find the
writing to be smooth at all. You also have to press firmly to get a consistent
line, which tires out your hand more quickly. The very slender barrel only
worsened the hand-cramping.Another problem: Because the point is slimmer, they designed the barrel to be
slimmer as well – which means that the cartridge is slimmer, and holds only
half as much ink. If that. My pen ran through all three refills in just a month
or two – and I was only using it for the daily crossword puzzle in the paper. "
lightning spaniel,"April 17, 2015","Nice fine tip, but burns through the ink REALLY fast.  The ink itself is more of

a great pen."

fingers as I write like other plastic pens. But the ink is TERRIBLE!! Yes, it
erases almost completely, there is still a bit of a shadow of what I have
written, but this is more like a gray colored ink. I have to do 2 coats of
writing for a solid black color. "
nyobi,"December 19, 2014","This is my favorite out of all frixion pens, specifically because of its

fast) and inconsistency (sometimes it doesn't flow; I've had a frixion pen where
the ink just stopped completely for no reason)Still like the frixion pens and am using them, but will take consideration into
buying more pens or not."

krityan,"November 15, 2014","While I love frixion, I just can't stand the look of most of their pens. The
tribal designs printed on most of them drive me crazy! Luckily, the slim has
none of that. They are very small but are still comfortable in the hand. I work in a restaurant, and these have quickly become my favorite work pens. The
eraser works well for making quick marks on receipts, and the small body makes
it easier to keep them securely stashed while in the kitchen."

will split and break just by using the pen a lot over time. So, to stop this;
when I get a new one, I take a piece of scotch tape and put a neat little wrap
of it all the way around the outside edge of the cap where it snaps on. The tape
comes right up to the edge but does not go over the whole.This stops them from breaking, and you don't really notice the clear tape at all

has split down the side, and the cap has started to crack along the top. It's a
bit aggravating because it's spent most of its life sitting on my desk or in my
pen case, so I haven't done anything to warrant the body breaking. All in all,

writes well (my girlfriend adores it, she also has small hands and it fits
extremely well to her)I cannot seem to get the right ""lines"" out of it. i
believe this will take some practice in part of my growing accustomed to
fountain pens. This is a replaceable ""cartridge"" that fits into the body of the
pen. I haven't been blown away by the overall experience with the nib, but this
is a great start into anyones foray into fountain pen collecting. "

sohgrove,"September 23, 2022","This has become my new favorite pen! Next to the Energel Clena, I thought I
might not like the feel of a fountain pen (This is my first) But it feels so
smooth and elegant to write with! I tend to use this more for journaling and
note taking, and use my Clena for bullet journal and scheduling. But that's
personaly preference, you can absolutely use this Fountain Pen for both! I'll
definitely be purchasing a different nib size to try next time I buy some more
stationery. Highly recommend!"

quasistellar,"August 1, 2022","I've read what seems like hundreds of glowing reviews about these pens so I just
had to try a few.  My main motivation was to get something I wouldn't worry
about staining to use Baystate Blue in.  I ordered all 3 sizes.Well, to be brief:  they were all terrible.  If it was just one, I'd write it off as bad luck, but all three were really,
really bad.  The finest nib was extraordinarily scratchy and hard started
constantly.  I use lots of fine/extra fine nibs and this was not ""toothy"" -- it
was tear the paper scratchy.  The medium nib was probably the best of the bunch:
reasonable feedback, but it had hard start and drying out issues.  The broad nib
was smooth (as broads usually are), but again had really bad hard start and
drying out issues.I tried tuning up the worst offender a little with micromesh and checking tine
alignment, but alas the extreme scratchiness and hard starts persisted.For comparison's sake, I have a 4 pack of the cheapo Zebra fountain pens that
all worked beautifully out of the package, and work perfectly every time I use
them (about once a month or so) with no hard starts or scratchiness.Three strikes there.  I'm not going to spend too much time trying to tune a $5
fountain pen, so I just threw them in the garbage.Please don't let these be your first fountain pen experience.  Get a twsbi
swipe, lamy safari, or pilot explorer.  Or heck, get those cheapo Zebra ones."
John Cannaarey,"July 26, 2022","I purchased this pen to try out Noodler's Black Ink.  Not disappointed.  Writes

has a flow issue.  I have to shake down a couple of times to write every time. 
I am suspecting that the little ball inside the cartridge is blocking the ink
flow, which I cannot believe.   "

am very happy with the way that it writes and how it feels in my hand. i
recently converted it to an eyedropper pen and haven't had any problems with
leaking. my only complaint is that the plastic on the cap has cracked in
multiple places. maybe this is from me posting the cap too hard on the end of
the pen. i have put some tape around the bottom of the cap now to keep it from
cracking further and will be more gentle with it in the future. it's more of an
aesthetic issue than a performance issue. i will invest in a sturdier fountain
pen in the future, now that i know that i enjoy using them, but i will keep this
one as a back up, or to experiment with different inks, until it falls apart
completely."

Rotsterne,"March 7, 2022","These are great pens. I don't care very much for the fine nib because I prefer
extra fine, but that doesn't detract from this pen's quality one bit. It does peeve me a bit that there are more colors available in ""fine"" size than

I have a mislabeled fountain pen that I have to rehome. "

cartridges, and the Kuretake Karappo empty cartridges fit these! Much cheaper
than a converter. The downside for me is the barrel cracks easily, so I won’t
eyedropper these. I don’t want to deal with an ink spill in my bag! If you
want an upgrade in aesthetics, the Prefounte has the same guts but a chic look,
and still a super affordable entry level fountain pen. "
happygret,"February 7, 2022","Great value! It's often recommended as a starter pen, including Jet Pens. It's

bought 3 clear ones to use for trying ink colors.Stays wet even if I don't use it for a few days. I live in a VERY dry climate,
so this is critical. Downside: the converters are $11, which is more expensive than the pen and
cartridge colors are limited.Upside: It's the pen I'm most likely to convert to an eyedropper pen."

realizing how much of a gem it is. I'm left-handed, and initially I had issues
with the ink not flowing correctly or finding the right angle to hold the nib.
Now I store it nib-side down, and it writes extremely reliably and is THE
smoothest pen I've ever used. The ink doesn't try down pitch-black, but that
doesn't bother me terribly since I'm just using this to journal."
Lyric Thompson,"June 14, 2021","Decent knock about fountain pens. Almost everyone i've ordered has written well.

carolyn19john,"April 16, 2021","I got a pack of these in different colors - so excited to get and play with for
journal sketching.  They all quit flowing in the middle of writing and need the
nib moistened to get the flow back - which is then temporary.  I'm holding
upright and stored them vertically to see if that helped.  I use a journal with
paper formulated for ink and my other fountain pens work well on it. I know you
can't return so I'm putting them in the give box - though hate to just pass the
problem on - at least someone gets them for free.  I just want to encourage
other people not to buy these pens if you need a hassle free ink flow.  My
experience seems different from others from these reviews but since it was not
just one problem pen I think it's a product problem. "

up. It lasts pretty long. The barrel is plastic, but it's sturdy. I would buy

cost and high maintenance--and STILL have a pen that is refillable--this one
isn't bad to try out. Pen comes with cartridges that match the pen body, but you
can also order the cartridges separately. However, at this price point, I would
personally just buy another pen if I wanted another color altogether.Another plus to this pen, due to the fine point and smooth flowing ink, my hand
writing is actually more legible than normal. :)"
ladyflash,"February 11, 2020","This was fun to write with, though if you leave it uncapped for more than 15

my two cents. The lines are smooth and I've never had any issue of flow. Not
scratchy at all. The thing that really blew me away was that I left this pen
forgotten in a drawer somewhere after I had already flooded the nib with ink and
written with it. The pen sat there laying on its side for, like, a year. When I
took it out, it wrote perfectly fine just like the day I got it. I read
everywhere they say to clean these pens regularly, or don't let them go unused
for too long or it will clog. Well maybe I lucked out, but I forget this pen for
weeks, sometimes stored nib side down, sometimes on its side, and it always
writes reliably. Not saying you shouldn't clean your pen. Just saying this is
how my pen has been."

not be out much, little did I know how much I would become attached to it.I love this pen so much I have bought several over the last couple of years to
give out to friends in the hopes of getting them 'hooked' into the world of
writing with fountain pens - many have told me that they are still using them.This is a great 'bang for your buck' fountain pen, especially for people that
are curious about fountain pens are want to try it out without spending a lot of
money.  What will surprise them is the quality of the pen and the ink and the
overall quality, it just keeps going, and going, and going.  I have been using

somewhat hard, and it's not a nice feeling. However, it's a good fountain pen
for those who don't want to show others it's a fountain pen since it looks like
a regular pen if not seen from up close. Also, this might not be a verified review because I believe I bought it with
guest checkout. I won't be doing that from now on. "

refillable accessory recommended on here works ok, if a little bit messy)."
sugarshark,"January 24, 2019","Very cute affordable fountain pen. I'm not sure if it skips occasionally because
of how I'm holding it I'm new to fountain pens so it's probably my fault."
whoopseez,"August 3, 2018","Nice, cheap, beginner fountain pen."
ksgrandmamom,"September 6, 2021","I haven’t been able to use it at all!  I can’t connect the ink capsule in
the barrel to the section with the nib.  So it rattles around intact and I have
a fancy object.  I really like your company and its products but this one item is a
disappointment."
birrucor21,"July 20, 2021","Mines skipping quite a bit. Don’t know if that has to do with the fact I’ve
never used a fountain pen but I’ll continue to test it out."

debbiecraig,"November 4, 2019","Honestly, at this low of price, I wasn’t expecting much from the Platinum
Preppy but WOW was I amazed. Super smooth! I will be purchasing more! (I bought
the black and violet and am IN LOVE with the violet shade)!!"
cutey,"March 12, 2022","This pen looks just as beautiful in person as it does in the pictures. The
colors are so dynamic I could look at it forever. Natural sunlight really brings
them out."
effika,"March 31, 2022","Very pretty!  The EF nib has little feedback, but that's to be expected.  I love
how fine the line is-- this is a true extra fine!  The body is slightly
translucent and has a lovely pearl sheen with different colors in different
light."
leslie.hayes,"April 1, 2022","Absolutely gorgeous. The color shifts between green and purple and it's just
really cute. The box is even iridescent! "
toomuchbooty4dapants,"May 2, 2022","Really nice pen.  Easy to use. The color reminds me of the stone opal. It’s a
great pen to have in any pen collection. "
beepear,"April 28, 2022",Currently my favorite pen. The color is lovely and the nib is smooth. 
The Elevator,"December 9, 2022","Good value small pen for everyday carry, but not perfect.I have now had this pen for about a month, and it has been just ok. It does
exactly what it is designed to do, and it does that well. However, it isn’t
really anything special. The iridescent pearl white body looks nice enough, I
suppose, but it really has to catch the light to look extraordinary. Body feels
cheaper than my Platinum preppy, actually, which is a bit of a disappointment,
but that may be deceiving since the preppy caps are known for cracking.Writing is also just ok. It writes wonderfully smoothly for an EF nib, but for
the first 2 weeks I couldn’t get it to write without skipping. Your mileage
may vary, but I recommend just buying a converter and inking it from the tip,
rather than using the included cartridge, because it seemed like there were air
bubbles in the feed. Now that it is sorted, I am pretty happy with it, but
can’t wait to get a vibrant turquoise ink in. Kaweco blue isn’t quite as
good as this pen deserves."
dontbuycheapshoes,"August 18, 2022","I got this after a great experience with my other Kaweco Sport in Lavender EF. 
This nib is toothy in spite of trying to troubleshoot it at home.  It works
better if I wrote slower and make sure to use a flowing ink.  IMHO, the solid
colors look better than the iridescent.  I was warned of the quality control of
these nibs on previous reviews.  It will be a situational pen, the right ink and
the right paper...unlike the first one which does not have a picky diet."
Smokie Lee,"June 26, 2022","I love all things iridescent so when I saw this was the limited edition this
year I had to grab it. This is also my first Kaweco, and this little pen is a
beast. Feels sturdy, pocketable, easy to write with, the extra fine nib is
actually extra fine instead of ""a hair finer than broad"", and it looks great.
It's a tad bit shorter than other fountains pens when posted, which is ideal for
me but others might like a longer posted pen.Buy the converter and the clip when you get it though! Enjoy your new obsession
but leave some for the rest of us."
emilynoelle948,"November 30, 2022","Absolutely IN LOVE with this pen. It was my official first fountain pen & it’s
better than I thought it would be! Already adding more beautiful pens to my
shopping cart! "
birdman,"November 11, 2022","This is the most beautiful fountain pen I own. Every time I put it away I wonder
what momentary madness possessed me to buy this pen, but when I take it out
again the madness overtakes me once more. Sometimes I just stare at it and roll
it around. It's beautiful in the sunlight. This pen writes very well, and is quite smooth. The compact size is useful for
me since my pencil case is quite small, and with this I can fit another eraser
on top."
kwilly2007,"October 2, 2022","This pen is even more beautiful in person than online. The iridescent shimmer is
just gorgeous. It's my third Kaweco Sport, so nothing new there. It was a little
scratch the first 30 minutes I wrote with it, but it's working perfectly now.
Love it!"
lizriderwilson,"September 20, 2022","This pen was just what I was looking for in an affordable but beautiful pen. I
absolutely love the iridescent body! It is quite small so I need to post it to
write comfortably. I also had the cartridge fall out once but not sure if that
was my fault or not."
Kimberly,"September 1, 2022","I'm in love with the colors, it's just gorgeous! "
mfosb8650,"August 18, 2022","I absolutely love this pen! I was skeptical at first because of how small it is,
and I've never used an extra fine nib before, but after almost daily use, I
think this pen may be my new every day carry! Highly recommend "
businessbug4,"June 20, 2022",Love color.  Received order very fast
RCLang,"June 8, 2022","I have been searching for my perfect daily-use pen—something portable and
light—and this is it. It writes well, doesn't skip, and is so reasonably
priced. And, of course, it is beautiful! "
LizB,"June 6, 2022","Wanted this pen sooo badly when I first saw it. When I got it, I was devastated
at my hand cramping, because I'd never had such a short fountain pen.
Thankfully, I've been able to re-train myself and it is now my favorite every
day journaling fountain pen. I love that the cartridge and converter are tiny so
I get to enjoy using lots of different inks, even though I only write about an
A6 page per day with it. "
doot,"June 3, 2022","Very nice ergonomics and color, but the build material seems to be very poor.
Unfortunately I did not test it out as that would invalidate my return and I
couldn't justify the price tag for the build quality even if it is a very nice
writing pen."
tudester,"June 2, 2022","My first Kaweco Sport and I enjoy how compact it is. When posted, it's
comfortable in the hand and has a good weight. Beautiful iridescence and a
smooth writing experience. "
beckuh,"May 23, 2022","My first Kaweco and WOW it's all I hoped it would be! I can't speak for personal
preferences but it looks and feels beautiful when writing. I save it for desk
work as it doesn't have a clip and I have other pens that need attention as
well, but it's overall just stunning."
Kimberly,"January 10, 2023","I love this pen! Kaweco sport is my favorite and I fell in love with the
iridescence. Literally the only bummer is I don't get my favorite color ink with
it but jetpens has refills for cheap! "
acwillis,"December 30, 2022","This is my first standard size Kaweco. Do not be concerned about the size of the
box - it holds inside a stunning pen with a blue cartridge, a history paper
about the company, and a cute sticker!I downsized from a F nib to an EF nib, and it is perfect for my smaller script!"
antheawesome23,"December 3, 2018","I love the design and the general aesthetic of this pen. It makes me want to
study. The ink also dries pretty quickly like it is advertised, which allows me
to take notes quickly and have them look decent. My major problem is that the
ink skips so dang much that it removed two stars from my review right off the
bat. It skips to the point where I would have to retrace letters and works  m u
l t i p l e  times, and even then the same exact part of the letter would
continue to skip. This really ruins the flow of my note taking, and makes my
notes look sloppy. I don't know if I got a defective one, or it I'm just not
handling the pen properly, but I'm seriously peeved by the ink flow of this
seemingly great pen. I wish it was better, but for now it is bearable. "
AHLEXPILLENA,"December 3, 2018","Honestly, this is my favorite pen. I've always been a user of ballpoint pens --
gel pens always smeared for me especially under highlighters. The Zebra Sarasa
Mark On Gel Pen was like losing my virginity to gel pens. It's so smooth! It's
the first pen I've religiously used until the ink was all gone! Definitely
buying refills, and more! "
Kriss,"July 29, 2018","They live up to their billing - They really do hold up well to highlighting, especially if you give them just a
couple seconds to dry, which most of us would anyway.  It writes wet but dries
fast. It’s closer to a 0.5, but the ink is rich and the tip is precise. I love
the red and blue, also. "
jlynkb,"August 16, 2019",This pen skips a lot but does not smear at all.
lyc527,"September 19, 2020","This pen is the best for note taking, comfortable when holding and no smudging
with highlighters. Want it in all colors available "
Alex,"July 31, 2020","Does the job - definitely doesn't smear over highlighters or markers! But the
ink feels a little too ""grippy"" when I try to write with it, no matter the type
of paper. Like the ink is trying to glue itself unto the paper when it leaves
the tip, making me feel like I have to tug the pen along. Same for the Zebra
Sarasa Push clip in my opinion. "
lindacat1007,"July 14, 2018","I really like this pen.  It writes smoothly and on the surfaces I need it to
write on.  I will probably buy more."
boopboopbeep,"September 29, 2021","it skips a lot and I noticed that it railroads a lot as well I recommend the 0.5
as it's less scratchy and more opaque"
Mintea Bujo,"October 14, 2020","I've tried multiple gel pens: uni-ball signo, muji, pentel energel, and pilot
frixion, and this one is my absolute favorite ! The ink is juicy and smooth, yet
concise, and it has never skipped on me. Within just a few seconds of writing,
you can safely highlight over using milliners, tombow dual brush pens, and pilot
frixion highliters. Personally, I find the pen body comfortable to write with,
so it's great for long periods of studying. I've already gone through four of
these, and just ordered 8 refills! :)"
jlynkb,"August 11, 2019","The pen is great, it doesn't smudge from mildliners but does skip a lot."
rayzelainehv,"September 20, 2018",it doesn’t smudge!! i love it 
cshaffer819,"September 19, 2018","My new favorite pen for note taking. It dries so quickly and highlighters dont
smudge the ink. Everything in my recent order arrived quickly and in perfect
condition. I will definitely use jetpens again. "
avalaurv,"February 25, 2022","Not that great for me. The ink is pretty bad and skips a lot/has a lot of
etches. Also is pretty scratchy on the paper. The body is fine though, so if you
chucked another brand's refill in it, or even just the classic Sarasa refill, it
wouldn't be that bad."
heidiheidi160,"January 11, 2022",Good pen 
laura,"October 25, 2021",I like the thin line but this pen skips so much it's too frustrating to use.
sharonmoy.sm,"November 8, 2020","I have the Sarasa Dry 04 as well, and I prefer these more. In terms of writing,
they have the same feel (a bit scratchy because of how thin the tip is), but the
Dry creates a more bolder line compared to the Mark On. I use this pen for my
language studies - the thin tip helps a lot in writing slower and therefore,
neater. Might opt for the 0.5 mm in the future and then see which one I prefer."
ygbechhofer,"August 9, 2020","Ok, Pen. The feel is like a ballpoint."
maddykw,"July 14, 2020","The only pen that WILL NOT SMUDGE. As long as you give this pen a few seconds to
dry, it is incredibly resistant to highlighters, water, and other colored pens.
While it's not the smoothest and it does get slightly scratchy, it's a fantastic
pen and probably my favorite at the moment."
Magi,"July 6, 2020",Whoa! Dries super fast and writes quite clear. My new favourite go-to pen.
Annie,"June 26, 2020","I LOVE this! It’s a gel pen that can write on PLASTIC! I use this to write
dates on the bottom of my instax photos and after a minute or 2 of drying, it
will not smear. Another great feature is that I can actually ERASE it completely
using any eraser (but for reference, I usually use my Tombow Mono) and rewrite
again and again as needed. I used to use my microns for this purpose but then I
would have to leave it alone for like a week to let it dry. Ridiculous. If it
came in a finer point than 0.4, I would consider making it my main pen for
writing because it’s water resistant unlike most gel pens and markers. I’m
getting more for my boyfriend who is taking up journaling to record his progress
in disc golf/weightlifting  and this will perfect since he can use it on the go
and he won’t have to worry about smearing due to sweat, water or whatever.
Excellent pen!"
jed133,"May 2, 2020","This pen is extremely fine, so it isn't the smoothest pen I've ever used, but it
is not scratchy at all. It also is smudge-proof with the zebra mildliner
highlighters. "
Tsum,"March 28, 2020","Although the ink dries faster, it also skips a lot. I don't know if I'm  just
unlucky because I've ordered two and they had the same issue. Highlighting is
not completely smudge free and still gives off a bit of a shadow, but it is less
of a smudge compared to other pens. Lines tend to be a little larger than 0.4
mm."
anguianojessica523,"May 8, 2019","Love this for notes! Clean fines lines and no smear with highlighters. Sometimes
this .4 feels a bit scratchy on paper but otherwise a great buy for notes."
cherrystraws,"March 12, 2019","this pen really does dry extremely fast & it's perfect for you if you highlight
a lot. the body is a little bulkier than I prefer, and the ink isn't as rich as
say, a pilot juice 0.38mm or muji 0.38mm. it gets the job done though and I use
it during lectures where I know I'll be highlighting while note-taking."
BeccaLee,"February 8, 2019","It got great reviews, but I'm a little meh about this one. Not really impressed.
AND it smudged when I highlighted after writing. It dries fast, but not
instantaneously. Not a favorite of mine, it will likely migrate to the old pen
drawer. "

frequent to be a pleasant experience. "
leon25tian,"October 3, 2022","It's a really good pen, although not for me. I don't usually highlight

size may be too thin for me but it ended up being perfect! i really like this pen and hope to get the 0.5mm size in the future, as well as
some refills for the inkit feels really nice to write with and i wish i had something like this back
when i was still using mildliners for highlighters at school for some reason i also really like the design of it - the pop of green (or
yellow if it was 0.5 mm) , with the black base and grid backdrop - it's just
super cute!! one of my favorite purchases!"

j c k,"April 12, 2022","I've found that zebra mildliners will dissolve this ink and spread it around a
bit. It's not noticeable from a distance, but I'm up close and personal with my
notebook all day. Considering that the prevention of smearing like that is the
explicit purpose of this pen, I'm disappointed. Otherwise, this a very fine pen.

mizu,"December 28, 2021","Really wanted to like this one, but it skips and fails to write far too often
for me to continue using (specifically in the Jibun Techo). The ink color is
also somewhat dull, partially due to railroading. It may stand up to
highlighters well, but if I can barely even write with it in the first place,
that doesn't really matter. I'll be using other types of Sarasa pens instead,
which I've had a better experience with."

the design is aesthetically pleasing. It's also *very* smooth.I'm giving this a 4/5 because of the amount of skipping. I've had to retrace
letters multiple times without luck, so if this is a massive pet peeve for you,
do **not** buy this."

lindsay,"June 3, 2021","This pen is pretty good. It is definitely great for highlighting. You can
highlight after just a few seconds. The only reason I gave it four stars rather

los trasos son irregulares y la tinta no se distribuye bien."
brickwall847,"April 28, 2021","Nice pen! Darker then I expected on the Hobonichi paper, which frequently makes
my pens look dull. "
monika029,"April 14, 2021","It's a good pen but I don't love writing with this one like I do some others. 
The Sarasa Fineliner pens write much softer as do the Uni Pin Pen in similar
fine points.  This one feels a bit scratchy.  On the good note, it doesn't bleed
through in my Hobonichi planner."
crpierre188,"March 31, 2021",Dries really quickly and doesn't get smudged my mildliners

great condition though!"
KittyB,"February 8, 2021","Pen feels nice in hand with the rubber grip. Ink is a nice dark black, dries
very fast, and can highlight over it almost immediately - the holy grail for gel
pens. It's the only one I've used that ticks all these boxes. "
Arianna,"January 25, 2021","My new go- to pen. Writes nice on hobonichi. Comfortable feel in hands. Cool
kanji writing on pen body. "
emcushman,"January 20, 2021",Smooth and dries quickly 
ratboy,"January 16, 2021","greatest pen in the world. you really can highlight over it and i love the
crisp, matte lines. ink is very dark, black not grey. in love, obsessed with it."
donyels,"January 15, 2021","Love how quickly this pen dries and it write is a nice bold line.  Similar to
the Sharpie pen, but with a finer tip.  Such a nice pen, awesome that I can get
refills."
Cheryl,"January 12, 2021","They work better than other pens, but sometimes still smudge with highlighter."
pruittcy,"December 29, 2020","This pen sits right in my notebook cover, I love and appreciate my entire order."
ikofsky815,"December 28, 2020","This is my favorite black pen ever. It has the incredible Zebra Sarasa Clip
body, with a unique design that looks like graph paper with a pop of lime green.
Despite the fine tip size and fast-drying ink, the pen is fairly smooth. The ink
dries and can be highlighted almost instantly, and do not smudge at all with my
Zebra Mildliners, which are notorious for smudging. "
micahlahendrix,"December 21, 2020",Great! 
mynameisjmarshall,"December 16, 2020","It was recommended to me as an extremely fast drying gel-pen.  It lives up to
that evaluation.  All the markings are part of the barrel/clip, so it's not
going to look ""sleek"" - but it gets the job done and will save you time waiting
for ink to dry."
jenvick,"December 9, 2020","Beautifully fine point and stands up to highlights as advertised. The only
reason for the missing fifth star is that the ink isn't very dark."
wifetalks,"November 20, 2020","This pen is brilliant! I dries quick and I can use my mildliners over it almost
instantly with no smudge. I would use it all the time, but I only have one and I

chocfootball,"November 16, 2020",Nice!
torik5,"October 26, 2020","Maybe I’m impatient, but this pen isn’t as fast-drying as I expected. It did
smear a bit when I tried to highlight it after a second or two, but it was still
far better than any other gel pen with a highlighter "
jadeyujinlee,"August 28, 2020","Tested with my mildliners and had no smudging issues! So perfect and dries super
quickly! Way better than Muji pens and have a much more comfortable grip. "

drying lines."
Mark,"January 6, 2020",Love these pens.  Works well with highlighters.
spiffdeb,"November 4, 2019","I got this to avoid smears when highlighting. If you wait ~50 seconds it is good
with a zebra mildliner.  If you don’t wait, it does smear. Sarasa is my go-to
pen, but the MarkON doesn’t quite live up to the hype."
Breviceps,"September 4, 2019","Skips when writing on top of highlighter-but works perfectly when highlighting
over it no ink smears"
marisoto01,"August 19, 2019",Love it

looking to try the other colors next!"
annajmola,"June 21, 2019","Once this pen dries, you can use any highlighter on it and it won't smudge! The
ink is very dark but not as pitch black as some other gel pens."
afroge1sha,"May 9, 2019","First time trying this pen and now I wished I had bought more! It’s the one I
go for when I need a good solid black AND since it pairs so well with the

kzonies,"September 26, 2022","I have been away from fountain pens for a few years, and wanted to dip my feet
back in. LOVE this pen! Very easy to add ink, smooth writing, great feel in the
hand, and I love being able to see the ink. Very tempted to get more from TWSBI!"
pcknoll,"August 10, 2022","I’ve wanted a Twisbi for years, and finally got one when the beautiful iris

no skips or drips. Top notch quality. Love it!"
hernandez.jacob57,"November 30, 2022","The pen looks better in person than the pics, and I love how smoothly it writes
with so little pressure needed."
Makoto,"March 23, 2021","The best pen, Ferrari of fountain pens nibs. This pen is magic in your hands (I
am, in general, a soft writer, so this review applies mainly to soft writers).
I've been using it for a while, and it is my favorite for the following reasons:Nib: The nib on this pen is amazing; it is very soft, smooth, and flexible. And
although it is a flex, you can comfortably use it as an everyday writer, which I
do because I love it. Without using its flex capabilities (light pressure), it
writes somewhere between a Vanishing Point EF and a Kaweco EF, with the added
pleasure of a very subtle and lovely light variation. Surprisingly, if you add a
bit of pressure, it writes as a Fine/Medium, so it is as having two pens in one.
When using its flex capabilities, it is the softest flex I've had so far, and it
gives a generous ink flow. It makes calligraphy a complete pleasure.
Additionally, I have used other flex nibs on Tomoe River paper and got some
bleedthrough; with this pen, I have not!  I am certain that this nib is one of
the best you can get, and it competes easily with nibs on pens >$500 (I'm still
waiting to have a Nakaya pen with a soft nib to compare it to). Beyond the price
you pay for this pen, you start paying for a more luxurious body. The nib is a
Ferrari of nibs.Body: The body is made of resin, which makes it very light; this has the purpose
of not tiring your hand during extended writing sessions. For instance, when
writing with a Vanishing Point, which is heavier, I get tired quickly. While,
when writing with this pen for an extended period, I do not get tired at all.
Additionally, the body hardly gets any fingerprints which is very pleasing,
compared that to a Montblanc Meisterstück Classique, which is a fingerprint
magnet (also made of resin). Converter: It comes with a big converter that I have not used so far. I am using
the CON-40 because I plan to use the CON-70(the one included) when I have tried
more inks and decided on the main one to use with this pen. Also, I read that
people don't like the CON-70 because it is hard to clean. However, it is
possible to take it apart and clean it well; just search for the right video on
the web.In summary, this pen is amazing. You won't get any other new pen that gives you
that much value for your money. Writing with it is a dream."
darklinesart,"September 5, 2018","I am so glad that I finally bought this pen.The thin lines are not quite as thin and light as Falcon extra-fine (it's
close).But much thicker line variation and requiring a lot less pressure to flex.Also, I can write with just a thin line easily and the thick lines put down a
nice amount of ink.I haven't experienced any problem with ink flow (or anything else), but I tend to write slow when writing with line variations.I highly recommend!"
tonsan,"September 17, 2018","Very nice, perhaps even ideal, for my purposes (Pitman shorthand). It was softer
and smoother than I expected, and offers stronger line variation as well. "
BZMacL,"December 15, 2019","I have a couple of vintage flexible nib fountain pens. I love them, but they're
tricky and not for everyday carry. This isn't that kind of nib. However, unlike
any other modern nib I've tried, it's truly flexible. It's also comfortable and
smooth.Some reviews say that the flow isn't always sufficient for western writing. That
hasn't been my experience using Noodler's American Eel ink. I'll see how it goes
with Platinum's carbon black."
Baggage Handler,"March 16, 2021","Just arrived today, and filled happily with Noodler's Eel Black. Gorgeous body
and finish. As someone fond of flowy broad nibs (TWSBI, Pelikans) this is going
to be an adjustment to a finer-bodied script. I've had to slow  w  a  y  down,
not sure I like that.On typical 20# copy paper I find the Falcon nib scratchy; on Clairfontaine
papers in my journal, well, a dream. I flushed extra ink out of nib after the
cheap paper as I always fear fibers clog the slit.  Under loupe, no conspiracy
of fibers.  What are your anxieties?Lots of flex and line variation, albeit at slower speed.  A few times I'm having
problems with railroading when I go for a wider ""l"" or curved lettering.  But as
my letters are formed, ample ink is left on the page to dry.  Bravo!This Falcon will require a more precise style of writing from me.  I wonder if I
can change nibs as Jet lists a long list on the item webpage... ?"
aashley71,"September 30, 2021","I use this pen for sketching. I thought I'd try an upgrade to my Pilot Falcon.
What I got was not specifically an upgrade (although having more ink with the
con-70 converter is great, though you can pick up the Pilot Falcon metal and it
uses the same con-70), but different. I have not had an issue with ink flow like
I see many reviews discuss, but I'm also not in a hurry when I sketch, and I
also don't force flex the nib. What I love: the ink capacity, the expressive
lines, and the smooth writing on most any surface I've tried. What I'm not so
sure about: Is it an upgrade to the Pilot Falcon? Maybe not. It's different.
Maybe I haven't used them enough together to figure out how different. The
Falcon definitely lays down a finer line, the difference is so small, but if
that's your thing, just something to keep in mind. Love them both. Use them
both, just fill each with a different color. Will probably pick up another of
either the Pilot Falcon metal (only for the Con-70 converter capacity in the
metal version) or Custom 912 for just one more color on hand. You won't be
disappointed with either."
Ryanheimer32,"November 9, 2020","Surprisingly soft, luxurious nib with perfect ink flow."
mjwu7185,"April 28, 2022","Great pen! For a modern pen, the flex is pretty good. It's not razor thin to
broad, but you definitely get good variation for a modern flex pen. No
complaints! "
Art Pal,"April 27, 2022","I use several Pilot SF- and SEF-pens for normal cursive using the Latin
alphabet. Writing with this pen -- the Falcon nib -- is the easiest of these
three. By ""easy"" I mean that the line width can be changed over a wide range of
pressure -- seems nearly effortless! The only ink I have tried in this pen is
one I simplistically call ""thick and rich"": Sailor's Nioi-Sumire. So happy to
have such a fine pen and an ideal ink for it!!"
MrTomRN,"March 21, 2022","Beautiful line making and variation. Easy to use and maintain. Yes, expensive.
But it really does do what is asked of it. "

elianamelmed,"April 23, 2019","A great sampler! I wish there were more of the thicker pens (0.7) but it was
great to experience such a variety of brands and styles for the price."
whitleyt25,"March 21, 2019","Great pens and a nice selection. There is something in here for everyone. My
personal favorites were the two jetstreams. Also, the energel was very nice. I
tend to like a very bold ink and most of these pens felt just a little on the
lighter side of what I like. But the energel was exceptionally bold."
katherine.m.orlando,"June 16, 2021","Such a great value to try out some pens. I think the Jetstream is my favorite
because there is just the right amount of friction with the page. Acroball and
Power Tank are extremely smooth if you prefer almost 0 friction. Power Tank is
especially good for someone who prefers a larger diameter pen to grip."
cgnpens,"June 26, 2022","I love samplers in general, though ballpoints seem to generally be more miss
than hit for me, esp. compared to roller-ball and gel pens. The Zebra Surari,
Uni Boxy, and Zebra F-301 were immediate nos, but the Pilot Acroball and
Jetstream Standard were very solid for my tastes. I wouldn't buy this sampler
again, but I'm happy I bought it for the purpose of trying out several
ballpoints at the same time."
jgerbitzg,"January 17, 2023",Nice sample. I'll use them up to determine which one(s) I prefer.
little_book_worm,"January 13, 2023","These ballpoint pens are smooth and write very closely to my gel pens, meaning
that I use less pressure and my writing is still nice and visible. Good quality "

baughbuffy,"June 9, 2022",Several of the pens would not write. I was expecting much better quality.

lescase,"May 27, 2021","The majority of pens in this sampler were not to my liking, despite glowing
reviews.  I found two decent pens (though still not as good as the pen I already

points of sampler packs is to learn what you DON'T like, but I was hoping to
find a few more that were tolerable. "

wish it could handle faster strokes, I have to draw slowly in order to get a
full black line."
alexa.cook,"April 21, 2016","I love this pen! It's my favorite for brush lettering. The Zebra pen has a
darker black ink but you don't notice that this one isn't as dark unless you're
actually comparing. A definite must in my craft room!"
kimcondra,"November 3, 2016","I love this pen and the others I got with my order.  I wanted to try brush
calligraphy so I went out to my local craft supply store and bought what they
had.  The tip on that pen was too brush-like and my attempts were awful.  I
decided to buy a few of the pens I read about from other brush calligraphers and
I am so glad I did!  The tip on this pen is wonderful.  I have been using it now
for a couple of days and it is still working great."
Ickabod,"June 6, 2019",Nice line weight variation and pen control.
mvocouch,"January 24, 2018","This is my favorite pen from my Jet pens order. Due to the felt tip it's not too
difficult to control the thickness of the line. It's very similar to the Zebra
Disposable Brush Pen (Fine) that I ordered, which is cheaper. Hopefully the
price difference translates into this pen lasting longer than a Disposable. I
wish it was available in a finer tip."
brushpenaholic,"January 4, 2018","Oh yes, a beautiful pen. This pen is my favorite felt tip brush pen thats on the
thinner and firmer side. It has not worn down on me and I can get great lines
with subtle variation. It doesn't have the best ink flow but it's definitely
good enough for me. Just work slowly. A definite buy for beginners or for those
who need a thinner line."
Carter,"October 27, 2016","Smooth ink, easy to use, definitely one of my favorites as a beginner at brush
lettering. I have really enjoyed using this and plan on trying some of Tombow's
other brush pens. "
jeremysorrellart,"June 7, 2020","Easily my favorite new pen! Flows very nice, I can get lots of variety in my
lines and it holds up great to marker and/or watercolor. Highly recommend giving
this one a try!!"
ts12072002,"June 1, 2020","For a beginner to brush pens, calligraphy, and all as a leftie, I researched to
see if this was the best brush pens for beginners and I totally agree! To my
fellow lefties, I would highly recommend this or the hard brush, can't get a
better deal for a high quality brush pen :)"
raerae,"May 8, 2020","These are probably my favorite inking pens for my artwork. They have a bit of
spring, and hold up perfectly after multiple washes of watercolor with no
smudging. The paper eventually eats up the nib, but nowhere nearly as bad as
Sakura Microns."
Chris,"September 29, 2019","Works well on bristol, bleeds on sketchbook paper. It will probably be best for
comic strip type work as the line thickness is between 08 and 1."
smhgart,"May 16, 2019",I prefer the hard tip vs. the soft but love it the same. 
Biggie Chinx,"March 26, 2019","These are beautiful pens!   Nice, soft(!) brush pens.   Will give you a nice
variety of line widths."
NetMktr,"March 12, 2019","Bold strokes angling the tip works for me , I can't control the depth of stroke
as easily as I can with the my Japanese soft brush. Only once, in the last three
months of use, I removed the cap and had to wipe ink from the area under the
cap. Very happy with flow of ink and retention of tip. With a light touch
incredible detail can be obtained. "
jackie_n_lady,"January 30, 2019",Great like the harder tip just a pinch softer.
ayalaht,"January 3, 2019","Nice, not so different from the hard tip in my opinion, they are both very
useful, especially for lettering newbies."
scruz,"November 27, 2018",Love the broadness and variety of line available with this pen.
comicnurse,"November 14, 2018","consistent lines, nice deep black"
Bear,"November 4, 2018","I wasn’t too happy with this one at first but I slowly got used to it. Now
it’s one of my favorite pens. The tip is nice and soft and, as soon as you get
rid of the habit of ‘pushing the tip‘ (like I did ^^”) this pen can become
a great tool for drawing and writing.The ink is resistant to copic maker and erasing. So it’s perfect for small
drawings which include spot coloring.I’ll definitely order more of those in the future :) "
Yane,"October 16, 2018","I love how juicy this pen is and how easy it is to control.  I prefer the soft
nib over the hard nib. "
moschetto.elizabeth,"September 18, 2018","Does the trick for the smaller, shorter pieces I like to create!"
Telebomb,"September 8, 2018","Simply the best for a beginning brush pen calligrapher. I have 5 or 6 in combos
of soft and hard."
jorgejamiegomez,"August 23, 2018","By far one of my favorite of the Tombow brush pens, actually it is my favorite
brush pens!  Better jet Jetpens has free shipping with any order of $25 or more

breiapettaway,"August 17, 2018","This pen is thicker than the hard tip which is ideal for thicker lettering.
It’s also softer and a bit easier to use. "
connierose,"August 6, 2018","Ah, a brush pen that actually works for me. I've tried virtually all the others,
and this is the best for me."
cmln,"August 3, 2018","Really great pen for beginners to hand lettering. It's much less intimidating
that a dip pen and can still make those hairline thin strokes. After a while
though, the pen loses its crispness and needs to be replaced if you want those
very fine marks. "
pamelaray250,"May 19, 2018","I hold my pens and pencils very close to the tip, but this brush pen restricts
me from that because if I do, i'll get ink on me! It'll get some getting used
to, but the quality is exceptional. I recommend it."
nmatelski,"February 10, 2018",Fun pen to draw with. Kind of bounce yet still firm. 
constantine9484,"January 28, 2018","I absolutely love this pen. You can get a wide variety of line weights without
sacrificing control due to the hard but flexible nib. I haven’t had any issues
with fraying or any other damage that happens with softer brush nibs. It’s
copic and water resistant (although if you scrub at it enough it will smudge.)
this is for sure my favorite pen and I’d recommend it to anyone who likes
lining with brush pens!"
ruoxuanshao,"January 16, 2018","It's a good brush pen and I like that it's waterproof! I personally prefer how
the Pentel Fude Touch feels, but opinions differ so objectively this is still a
quality brush pen. "
randomgirlxrulz,"January 6, 2018","A great first brush pen! (Well, technically my liquid eyeliner pen was my first
brush pen, but this is my first for art.)I've only ever drawn with pencils and technical pens before, so this was a
wonderful way to experiment with line variation. It's kind of addicting! I never
want to stop using it.My experience with painting is minimal, so I've only ever used brushes in
makeup. That being said, I still recommend this pen for beginners. Its softness
makes it a bit difficult to control, but that's nothing practice can't remedy."
dglongjr,"February 17, 2016",Fun to write with.  Good pen for starting with brush-tips.
janichiev_,"July 4, 2015",a very good pen to use for lettering/calligraphy! 
Christina,"June 29, 2015","My favorite disposable brush pen, tried and true. I use this pen for drawing,
and it has a great feel when illustrating thick and thin lines. The nib is more
flexible than many other ""soft"" brush pens I've tried, but it's also resilient,
and doesn't fray or lose its shape. After several months of pretty heavy use,
the nib was still tapered to a fine point and had only warped slightly from
pressure being applied in a certain direction. The flow is consistent, and the
ink is dark and opaque. I just bought my second one, and have a feeling I'll be
buying many more after that!"
crawfordrl,"June 10, 2015","I love these pens. I've tried others and have not ever found any that match
these Tombow pens for fluidity and their responsiveness to the pressure applied
to the tip. They make me want to draw every day."
leebcgfx,"December 16, 2014","I still can't find a felt pen I like. If you like felt tips, then you will like
this pen. I'm hung up on brushes and dip pens."
suzanne,"December 3, 2014",These are fun!
Elaine,"October 27, 2014","Great for illustration and brush calligraphy, due to the firmer brush tip that
allows for both wide and narrow brush strokes. The ink runs out pretty quickly,
but the performance of the pen still gets 5 stars. A refillable version of this
pen would be amazing. "
anton,"October 22, 2009","These are really nice for comic lettering and writing in general. The pen body
has a nice feel too. Not a lot of dynamic range/width, but a solid writing pen."
Cindy S,"November 23, 2022","Very nice tip and gives a bit of line variation, more than the hard tip in the
same brand."
kadingoetz,"November 16, 2022","Excellent! The pen arrived in perfect condition, and it's amazing! I got exactly
what I wanted out of this purchase."

fo_gege,"October 14, 2022","Good brush pen, love it. Wish it didn’t come with the plastic guide though, I
don’t know what to do with it when repurchasing due to the ink running out."
Happyyearround,"September 4, 2022",Perfection!
krys,"July 26, 2022","Works really well! I wish it was a liiittle more flexible than it is, but still

doctorpoppins,"July 1, 2022","Whenever I use these, my friends think I'm so fancy to be able to write like
that. If you're getting into hand lettering, this is a must have!"
guttedsquid,"June 1, 2022","This pen made a huge difference in my handlettering. I had used the larger
tombow  markers exclusively but when I switched to this it looked like my skills
transformed before my eyes. I get beautiful results with this, it's really easy
to control line thickness, much easier than larger brush markers. It seems
resilient so far."

kelleypen,"September 16, 2021",Great pen.  Lovely to use.
howwepenthings,"August 30, 2021","This is one of my go-to brush pens when I want to line art. The soft brush tip
makes it pliable but not so much that it will drag behind your motions. It lasts
for a long time as well, and even after not using it for months at a time, the
ink hasn't dried up at all. A highly recommended brush pen!"
ylianagacha2007,"August 13, 2021",great!

vibrant and flows smoothly. 5 stars!"
chizoo,"April 1, 2021","Absolutely flawless, it's a mixture of thick and thin lines depending on what
angle you use on your hand. The ink is spotless and very rich, solid black. It's very comfortable to draw and write with. Strongly recommend if you like a switch from thin and thick by the movement of
you hand. "

different brands of hard tip brushes and have always struggled. This soft-tipped
brush pen is a game changer, I love it."
CMMFL,"November 10, 2020","Love this pen! The brush tip is the exact size and firmness I was looking for.
I've been using it A LOT and it has maintained the ability to go between making
finer and thicker lines. It's definitely a go-to in my growing collection of
brush pens!"
Meili,"October 28, 2020","Great little brush pen and works as intended.  When I get the hand of it it's

ashley.mh.wilson,"August 10, 2020",I love this pen! It's a great basic for brush lettering! 
Guest,"August 5, 2020","This one (soft, nayaka) takes a bit more control to create thin strokes compared
to its hard (shikkari) counterpart in my opinion. It's still a great pen, but if
you are a beginner looking to write in Japanese or Chinese at smaller sizes
(like in a notebook), I would recommend the hard version so that your more
intricate characters are more easily legible."

unfortunately. "
rozjournalrat,"April 6, 2020","I'll say the same about this as I did about the Hard tip: A strong, resilient
fiber tipped brush pen that allows you to make a wide range of brush marks.
Lasts long and strong over the course of many drawings. You can paint in
watercolor over it immediately. I love this pen. My only problem with this pen
is that there is a hard tip and a soft tip and I like them both, but one has a
dark blue cap and one a black cap and I can never remember which is which and
have to take the caps off and…It's also hard to tell the dark blue from the
black. Otherwise a wonderful pen."

seem to struggle with consistency. "

in my sketchbook all the time."

Pandabear56,"December 14, 2017",Good brush pen.
alexandria_bermudez,"December 7, 2017","Really love the feel of it as I'm drawing. The tip gives an easy and accurate

want to draw. Would totally get it again."
Rita,"December 3, 2017","Love this brush pen but it does fray if not used on proper paper. I love using
brush pens for headings on my notebook but after a couple uses it frayed a lot.
Other than that its a great brush pen."
Rich,"November 30, 2017","Holy SMOKES, but this is a great pen. Strong enough to hold its shape and
flexible enough to pull a line with great character to it. This might have just

gabbyfarley555,"September 18, 2017","I like, and it is soft so it's delicate but works nicley and fits great in hand"
mbashford,"September 14, 2017","Good brush pen.Comfortable to use and good for writing in Japanese or Chinese. I prefer the
Hard version as it offers a finer line due to the harder nib. The ink will
feather and bleed on thinner/lower gsm paper. This version might be better for
calligraphy than writing."
skywilling,"August 22, 2017","I loved this pen. WATERPROOF! Very fine tip that gives great control and good
line variation. I'm getting another."
mireke,"August 17, 2017","Great pen, but for my inexperience hands and brush calligraphy, Pentel Touch
deserves 1/2 star more. "
ashley.kang126,"July 11, 2017","The Tombow Fudenosuke Soft is incredible; every brush stroke feels smooth and
effortless, and the body itself is the perfect size for people with limited pen
case space, like myself. The nib is quite small, but offers just the right
amount of flexibility to create noticeable dynamics in line thickness. My
calligraphy has improved drastically simply from switching to the Tombow Fude
and I highly recommend you give it a try! "
zoomzoom6738,"July 10, 2017","Absolutely choice for a beginner In hand lettering. Perfect firmness for a lots

maybarbara,"June 21, 2017","Great flexibility for most types of calligraphy where you want that in a heavy
downward stroke. Dark, rich color also looks beautiful on the pages. If it
starts to get too flat on one side from constant pressure, just rotate and the
bristles will fix themselves. Not as thick or hard as a sharpie"
jojocopes,"June 1, 2017",Best brush marker. A must for lettering.
jlwilliams010,"May 6, 2017","I love this pen. Love, love, LOVE this pen! It came with my brush pen sampler
and I was completely taken by surprise with how good it was. It's soft, but not
too soft, reacts well to pressure and springs back nicely. I use it for
illustration, and it is one of my go-to pens. You will not be disappointed if
you get one."

krys1oh,"February 9, 2017",Love it!
Tsuki,"February 9, 2017","I have both the hard and soft body for this. They come with a little blue
stencil to help you center your kanji, which is pretty helpful if you're not
used to writing withing small boxes. This one is nice and springy, tapers nicely when you flick the pen, and feels
good in the hand. I've had no problem with smudging, but I always let my ink dry
for a little bit before touching it. It dries really fast. "

stiv,"February 3, 2017","These brush pens definitely upgraded my brush calligraphy game! So easy to make

these are the brush pens that I highly-recommend."

khatebernardez,"September 29, 2016","Would have been perfect, but there were white streaks in the middle every time I
wrote with it. The nib doesnt bounce back to the original form. I find myself
having to re-position the pen to achieve contrast of thin and thick lines. I'll
be trying the hard tip next time."
Anix,"September 28, 2016","First off, this pen shipped super fast. Like... 2 days before it was expected to
arrive so thats a great plus! When I tested the pen right away and immediately I
noticed it had great ink flow with a nice sharp point for a brush pen. I

oreoiskitty,"January 27, 2016","Great little brush pen. The feel of it is almost like a regular brush marker
with felt tips. Its line size variety is way better than felt tip brush markers though. When making thicker lines go slow or it wont come out as full and dark. Really great if you're mostly used to marker pens and felt tip brush markers. "

DiazArtist,"January 13, 2016","Pretty good pens with a nice tip. I've used them to write some Certificate of
Authenticities and they work well. Eventually the tip gets like most other felt
tips or whatever material this one is made of. The lines end up being bulky, but
still have ink. A very nice brush. I think I've used it a few times on artwork."

hard brush not the soft as it's very hard to control the line variation. "
thirdpotato,"October 14, 2015","The Tombow is one of my favorite brush pens. It delivers a rich, dark line and
the elasticity of the tip really gives the user solid control over the

pen."

slipcat,"August 6, 2015","Some people like these,  but I do not feel the line is anything special.   They
can't handle a faster stroke,  you have to take it easy or the lines fade...Control is easier with these pens (illustration -- not showing shakiness in your
lines),  but I want a pen with dark ink and that can handle a little faster
stroke. "

strokes and thin strokes in one sweep. Perfect for outlining and details. A must
have!"
lilyciara,"June 23, 2015","This is a lovely pen to use. I just want to play around with it all day. The
barrel says ""calligraphy pen"" and it is in fact perfect for that. I can get
extremely fine lines by holding the pen perpendicular to my paper and touching
it gently and drawing. Or I can easily get thin to thick lines. The springiness
of the small, soft felt tip feels really nice.I think this pen would be ideal for anyone who would like a crisp black ink with
varied line weight in one pen, especially for comic-style outlining.Between this pen and the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen, I don't think I need to add
anything else to my supplies for brushing ink on the page."
mark,"June 4, 2015","A great pen, but I like the hard (blue body) better."

Basu,"May 5, 2015","First brush pen I picked up ever and I can say I am pleasantly surprised. Bit of

Howard Tayler,"February 11, 2015","It's not a true brush, but it's perfect. This pen, along with the Hard - Blue
Body, fills the gap between rigid technical pens and true brushes. I use this
for adding line width to technical pen lines, and for light shading. Best of
all, the nib is an amazing non-felt polymer thing. I can really lean on it and
it doesn't split. (NOTE: The description is off. The barrel is a deep green, not black.) "

Sorchah,"June 3, 2012","One of the greatest pens ever. Nearly perfect in every way.  Keep in mind:nibs run large and usually wetpiston filler (requires bottled ink)the cap nubs on the section bother some peoplethe ink window is smaller than most but still functionscap clip has sharp cornersthe makrolon eventually develops a shinier patina"
Cheri P,"February 6, 2015","I absolutely love this pen. It's been my daily writer for about a year now. It
starts a line without a stutter even if it's been uncapped for a few minutes.
The ink reservoir is large and makes it through the day. I've yet to have it
leak in my bag (though I admit I'm careful about how I stash it....). I've flown
with it with no troubles. People always want to write with it. I don't let them. Mine!My only wish is that ""fine"" was more fine...."
Hassan,"May 24, 2015","I'm glad to hear that a lot of people have had great experiences with this pen.
Unfortunately, I have not.PROS: The pen has a very elegant design, and everything seems to be very well
manufactured regarding tolerances. The piston filler body is easy to use, and if
needed can be somewhat straightforward when disassembling for cleaning &
maintenance/storage. The weight is also right on par with my preference. I enjoy
pens that don't have that ""plastic appearance"", but I also do not necessarily
care for a really heavy pen. This pen (along with my Lamy 2000 rollerball), are
my go-to pens for dress shirts, as they don't weigh down the pockets, and the
pocket clip can spring open with the press of a button.CONS: The nib is really hit or miss. I've used the Extra Fine (EF), Fine (F),
and now about to move to Medium (M) because of how constantly disappointed I've
been with how ""scratchy"" the pen is. The worst part of this pen is the recent
issue I've had, which may have just been a ""lemon"" with regards to quality
control standards; the pens body has a hairline crack along the reservoir
window. I discovered this after finding ink on my hand nearly every time I used
the pen. I thought the cap may have been dirty, so I cleaned it and the issue
persisted. I hadn't dropped the pen or anything, but it did go a while without
use and was left clean and free of ink in storage.CONCLUSION: Aesthetically, it hits the mark. Functionally and reliably though,
it leaves me on the hunt for something else."
Oh Sadness,"October 18, 2017","This is a sleek workhorse pen with a timeless design.The Lamy EF nib should technically be 0.5 mm, but the wet-writing of the nib
will make the writing appear a bit larger--almost like a Japanese M (0.6 mm).It is a wonderful size for people with small handwriting, and it still has the
capability to make ink qualities shine on high quality papers due to its
wetness. The wetness also means that if you double back a lot in your own handwriting (if
you make a lot of strokes that overlap), the pen will lay down a bit more ink as
the wet ink on the paper draws out some more ink from the pen, particularly on
absorbent papers. This will give some people the impression that the nib writes
inconsistently. It really does not. There are also complaints about poor quality control in the Lamy 2000 nibs, but
this is not the case. The nib actually just has a particularly finicky sweet
spot. It is not really problem if you are used to it.  I find that the end of the pen by which the piston mechanism is activated can
sometimes loosen by itself a bit if not properly secured.I find this pen is comfortable on both higher and lower grips, but does feel
just a little top heavy when posted when very low grip is being used. The pen is
very well balanced, and is extremely comfortable to hold over long periods of
writing. It also has a hooded nib which allows for very low grips.The nib gives the user a feel of contact with the paper. Being that it is an EF,
this shouldn't be surprising, but also doesn't mean that this nib is poor to
write with. It is a joy to write with, and it glides and deposits ink in such
satisfying ways.It is a lovely investment of a pen, and will enrich the writing experience as
long as the sweet spot is accomodated. I give it a solid 5/5. It is my holy
grail."
michael.krushinsky,"November 8, 2012","Just received this yesterday; it's been on my want list for a year. I've used
Safari fountain pens for years, and I'm excited to step up to Lamy's
higher-level of elegance.  Pen writes exceptionally well; fine nib writes like something between a fine and
a medium nib on a Safari. Filling was easier than I'd anticipated, and I love bottled ink, so that's not a
concern. I am curious about cleaning and drying the pen when I choose to change
inks - I'm used to pulling the converter out of my Safari to allow everything to
dry as quickly as possible. Looking forward to having this pen for a long time!"
jppelt,"September 17, 2016","Seriously, I am not sure what it is, but this writes more smoothly than just
about any fountain pen I've ever used.  For lack of a better term, it fades in
your hand and writes as an extension of your thoughts.  Writing on Rhodia paper
feels creamy and luxurious.  I own more expensive, but this has become my daily
use pen.  Simply too good.  My only problem, my other pens are drying out due to
lack of use. "
ann.nassour,"January 29, 2016","The Lamy 2000 Fine has the smoothest gold nib I have bought for a modern
fountain pen.  The wider barrel acts gives the pen an ergonomic feel to it.  The
material of the pen allows for very good grip at all times. The fit and finish
is above average. "
rabzug,"January 1, 2020",bought it for a gift and the receiver was and remains thrilled with the 2000.
jrodriguezq,"August 19, 2019","I absolutely love all of the Lamy 2000 collection of writing instruments. I have
one or two of each model (fountain pen, F &M), rollerball, ballpoint, mechanical
pencil (0,7 MM) and multipen. Very pleased with built quality, material,
aesthetics and writing feel. And Jetpens has very fast delivery and excellent
customer service. Highly recommend.   "
Howard Roark,"May 17, 2019","This is a pen that every collector should have. The look and feel are terrific.
It is high quality and unassuming. Lamy paid attention to small details such as
how the pen caps and posts.The Fine nib is truly smooth. The medium degree of wetness works on most paper.
I am tempted to buy a Medium nib for kicks. We will have to see how the budget
goes."
able.play_0z,"January 13, 2023","Easy to fill, easy to use. My first fountain pen after some research and in my
budget."
snyderssoapbox,"December 22, 2022","For the money this pen costs, I expected a smoother writing experience. It was a
bit of a letdown. It is a handsome pen, in my opinion, and it does write well.
It seems to hold a good amount of ink, is easy to fill, and light weight. Even
with the cap posted it is well balanced due the materials used in its
manufacture. If you like the form factor, and aesthetics, this pen is worth the
money. If you don't care that much about those previously mentioned factors, you
can get a pen that writes just as well, for quite a bit less money. "
Myrima,"June 20, 2022","It’s a very good pen that remains popular based on the research I did before
buying. It lives up to the hype. The body and weight feels good in hand. Not too
heavy. I can write for extended periods without hand fatigue. The outer body
design is smooth but not slick. The “viewing windows” help just a little to
check when ink is about to run out. Could be larger, but, that would destroy the
aesthetics. The only negative is the protruding metal clips that lock the cap onto the pen
irritates my finger tips. I have a stronger grip when I concentrate on writing.
Plus, I grip higher (further away from the nib). These hurt my fingers after
long periods of writing. I’m not writing novels, mostly journal and calendar
entries. So, I can easily live with this. Highly recommended. "
BroomCloset,"March 11, 2022","Hands down, my favorite pen."
babyscarletknight07,"December 15, 2021","This is probably the most amazing fountain pen I’ve gotten yet! (And most

smoothly and is really easy to refill. And it’s comfortable to hold (Sorry
TWSBI Eco, but it’s more comfy than you are "
bellanto,"December 13, 2021","This pen is akin to an old XJ6.  It costs a lot, it lacks a bundle of features

pulled up in  Nineteen Sixty Nine Jaguar with a polished burl wood dash.  Do it!"
slbradley,"February 16, 2021","Everything owners/critics say about this pen is true. I can only say good things
about it. The cap retention ""ears"" are solid and unnoticeable when writing. And
yes, it does have a ""warm"" feel to it. I went with the fine nib and it's perfect
for me and my writing style. Writes great right out of the box."
i8thepie,"July 9, 2020","Its reputation is deserved. The LAMY 2000 writes like a buttery dream, looks
classy as heck, and it is super easy to refill. Since it doesn't have a screw
cap, it is great to use as a daily carry writer. It's lightweight, but doesn't
feel cheap. A must have for any pen enthusiast who can afford it!"
michael.a.cheng,"March 23, 2020","Excellent nib, very smooth as long as you keep it in the sweet spot. Has a
generous ink capacity due to piston filling design. Also understated appearance
does not draw attention to the fact you are using a fountain pen."
brent.vandyke,"August 10, 2019","Very nice pen!  I love the feel, with just a very small amount of ""scratchiness""
but overall a very smooth glide.  The fine nib feels like almost a medium (as
others have commented) but puts down a very nice amount of ink while still
feeling detailed.I was nervous spending this on a fountain pen but I am extremely happy with the
decision!  I find myself looking for more things to hand write now.I paired this pen with the Pilot Iroshizuku Take-sumi ink, and they seem to work
very nicely together."
jor.hp90,"January 9, 2018","Master pen. It's reputation just confirms the actual performance of this writing
tool"
una.chung,"May 9, 2019","I ordered this pen because it looks beautiful in photos and is very popular with
writers. It turned out to be too large for my small hands. And I wasn’t crazy
about the texture—it’s matte but with a slightly rough and scratchy feel. It
probably writes great (I didn’t ink it so I can’t say for sure) but the
aesthetics weren’t quite for me. "

tys.choi,"May 21, 2012","This is the sweet spot.  The .38mm is not too thing or too bold.  I found .4 to
be too thick and .3 to be too thin.  0.38mm seems to be the sweet spot.  Also, as far as the color, its just the right amount of blue where it doesn't
hurt your eyes but its enough blue to distinquish it from black.  Its the best!"
zerodb,"August 18, 2010","I find the 0.38 mm version to be a sweet spot of fine, concise lines and ease of

still professional in appearance to be used in a business setting."
hpavane,"March 21, 2013","The perfect everyday pen for jotting down songwriting ideas in my pocket Field
Notes. A great combo for remembering ideas, phrases, etc. rather than trusting
my memory or slips of paper. Great for journal books too, which I use to flesh
out lyrics. The ink flows fluidly smooth, lays down a nice fine line with no
scratchiness. I love these pens, almost as much as my fountain pens. Maybe more
because I use them everywhere.  I started with green-black; which still has not run out of ink, even though I've
used it every day for almost a year! I have since bought more; green-black,
blue-black, bordeaux-black and brown-black. The black ink tones down the colors
- they have become my signature pens. The only problem is that folks tend to
""borrow"" them. But at this price I can easily afford to buy as many as I need.  BTW - As an old-school songwriter I really love to put pen to paper. I buy all
my writing tools from JetPens. You could say you guys rock, literally. "
soramy,"June 9, 2006","these pens are my pride and joy. ever since i accidentally stumbled upon one a
few years back, i was hooked......to the point where i absolutely refuse to use
any other pen. NO JOKE. my boyfriend thinks i have an unhealthy obsession with
the pens, but i gave him a set to test out and he seems to be secretly enjoying
them himself as well....=D PEOPLE, you have to invest in one to see for yourself."
csurguine,"March 15, 2006","I love this pen! I first purchased one of these pens while studying in Hong
Kong, and was impressed with the efficient, durable design. But when I got back
to the States, I couldn't find the pens or refills anywhere. I stumbled across
this site, and ordered a big box so I wouldn't run out again.  The tiny carbide steel ball (0.28 and 0.38 mm) means less ink is wasted compared
to the American Signo line. At the same time, it writes as smoothly as a regular
gel pen. My only regret is that I can't purchase them in bulk."
Eckert,"April 18, 2016","This color if perfect for work use (I work in banking, where 99% of everything
you do must be in black ink). It's dark enough to pass as black and scan in
correctly on official paperwork, but gives your work a bit of subtle flare while
remaining professional. This pen would be perfect if it were a clickable rather
than capped."

efficiently and with a smile on my face every time I have to write, draw or read
my notes.I feel as if I have tried them all, have come back and forth to this pen a few
times, and am blown away by this Signo .38mm in Blue Black. I feel for some
reason that it is even smoother than the black and the color is not only
amazing, but I feel easier to read, study and take information back in, when I
am reviewing my notes. It's not good enough to write it. The reading experience
is critical too. This Blue Back is Nirvana.Thank you for offering it!"
alex,"November 21, 2014","This is the perfect pen, hands down. I'm in college, and go through at least two
of these 0.38 blue black signos each month. The ink flow is extremely smooth and
uniform (I found the 0.3 Pilot Hi-Tech-C to be extremely scratcy), and the 0.38
fine tip is perfect. Personally, the 0.28 is too fine and 0.4 is too thick. The
ink color is ideal, dark enough to use for everything, but just enough blue to
keep it interesting! Great pen in every aspect, do yourself a favor and buy a
few! (cause one won't be enough)"

missCoco,"January 9, 2020","I got the set of black shades for this pen for Christmas, and gifted a friend
the blue black one, so I had to buy myself one as well once I realized how great
these pens are. I've used the Pilot G-2 retractable 0.38 pens for years, but I really think the
lines from the same tip size uni-ball pens are thinner, yet the ink-flow is
equally good! The only issue is they do need to stay capped when not in use, I've sometimes
had inkblobs form when I'm fidgeting with a pen for a long period between
actually writing if the cap is off."

past month and the ink still hasn't run out. 10/10 would buy again!"
evie12.ev,"October 7, 2016","I use this pen for my notes and happens to be my favorite color so far. It's not

great fine point pen that is my go to. I will buy ten more as backups but
they'll probably run out soon!"
zach,"September 29, 2016","This pen is fantastic. It writes smoothly and rarely requires more than a word
to ""warm up."" The color is just right and the line is precise and not scratchy.
My one reason for removing a star is that its tip is actually weaker than it may
seem. I ruined more than a couple by dropping then while penspinning. After
that, they refused to write at all. However, I have taken care not to penspin
with my current one, and it is almost out of ink and performs perfectly.
Unfortunate, given their perfect balance when posted. Guess I just have to get
better ;)"

bedwards,"June 29, 2016","My first experience with the blue/black color, as well as this pen.  What an
outstanding little pen, I have found the color to be quite interesting and nice
conversation starter as unique touch.  The pen, as others have mentioned,
performs very well. I've found the the precision to be very high, and as a
result my writing has a more neat and elegant look to it that I can't achieve
with a ball point.  I purchased the Hi-tec-c at the same time and these pens are
similar but also different I would recommend if others like one they try the
other as well."

jina100,"February 24, 2016","I adore all of the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 pens with the black ink mixed with a

brighter color pen. I definitely love the blue black."

sagebrush,"January 9, 2016","I'm a little obsessed with blue black ink. The Uniball Signo 207 is the one that
started my obsession, but I found that it skips on me as I write, so I was
determined to find an alternative and bought a large selection of blue black
pens from JetPens to sample. This pen is one of my favorites of that lot (I also
really liked the Pilot Juice .38 and the Zebra Sarasa 0.5, but I will be
purchasing the Sarasa in the 0.4, because I prefer a finer line, and I didn't
realize when I bought it that I was buying a larger size).  The ink seems to be
close to the color of the Signo 207, but I've had no problems with skipping, and
I prefer a finer line, anyways."
twrose85,"November 28, 2015","I am slowly, but pleasantly adjusting to the finer resolution of these pens.  I

unmatched. "

even from the .38, and the point is solid enough to handle a heavier writing
hand without collapsing."

bogmire7,"November 13, 2014","Nice, good feel."
bbfanatic,"October 26, 2014","What I love about this about this pen: it's combination of sharpness and
character. Too many micro gel ink pens are drab and boring. Looking at you,
Zebra Sarasa (0.4, blue black). This pen is different. It's bright! Exciting! ""Look at me,"" it says, ""I'm INK!
On a PAGE! Remember this part! When you SWOOPED that lower-case e? And how about
this upper-case T! What a FLOURISH you made when you crossed it! Wowwee!!""...and so forth. Silly yes, but it's fun to use a gel pen like that sometimes.
It also makes for the most legible, glance-able notes you've ever taken. Maybe
it just suits my small writing style, but the lines are so razor-sharp that I
could transcribe the Gettysburg Address onto a postage stamp with one, probably.
And then do it 100,000 more times, because the ink reservoir is seemingly
infinite. Two semesters of hard notes and I'm still on my first one.So why only four stars? Maybe it's a defective unit, but this isn't exactly the
most consistent pen in the world. It's slightly snobby and doesn't like the
cheap paper you might find in the wild, and sometimes it throws a fit and
decides fade away and stop working altogether. Twice now I've had to soak the
tip with rubbing alcohol to resurrect it, even with regular use. But every now
and then, you'll strike a chord with this pen, and I hope you do, because when
you do you'll be using the best pen in the world."
dana.bailey,"October 23, 2014",love this color
Empressionzoo,"September 12, 2014","A good blue black is hard to come by. This pen provides a really nice deep blue
black. Like all other uni-ball pens, this one glides smoothly (the 0.38 mm is
amazing) and the weight of the tip and body makes writing comfortable. Doesn't
feel like a fragile/poorly made plastic pen. "
torans,"January 21, 2014","Best cheap pen on this site hands down..  such a pleasant writing experience and
the ink flows superbly.  .38mm tip is definitely the sweet spot as far as tip
size for thin lines without any scratchy feeling.  I wish they made refills for
this bad boy."
NeoBritzAM29,"November 3, 2013","I am a pen fanatic especially those that are made in Japan when I was kid. Then
I rediscovered my love of gel ink pens when I purchased a set of vivid, vibrant
colors at Jetpens.com. So far the Uni 0.38mm blue black has been my favorite
while I use it for studying and at work. This pen is great because it is
comfortable with a rubber grip while I am writing, and it is smooth to write on
any paper. It doesn't smudge, leak and blot. This point is perfect. I suggest
you to buy the refills because it is cheaper rather than buying the pens. This
online store is cheaper by $0.15 or 15 cents compared to another Japanese
stationery store that I typically buy. The Uni pens is made in Japan only carries the 0.28 and 0.38mm versions. The
colors were vibrant and you can tell the difference compared with the Uni Vision
Elite or Uni Needle (their black variant colors are more darker than the ones
sold in the US). The color palette of Uni signo pens have more vivid color
choices compared in the US."
cobwebsandspiders,"October 10, 2013","I ordered five UM-151 pens, all 0.38 and of different colors.  Out of them all,
the blue-black pen was the only one that wrote scratchily and skipped
consistently.  I believe I may have received a faulty product."
rdibelka,"August 14, 2013","For general office use, this is too fine for me. I really like a nice big bold,
easy to read line. So the .38mm Signo's sat in my drawer unused.  I had to edit some technical drawings by hand recently, then these really stood
out. They really do write exceptionally well, and leave a nice fine line. From
what I have read they are even waterproof. I left this five stars because they
do what they are supposed to do flawlessly."
Lapicerista,"April 28, 2013",Beautiful blue black color and nice line thickness. 
janetay56,"June 21, 2020","Uni jetstream's ink is really different from typical ballpoint ink, writes
really smoothly. The pen barrel is so adorable with Jiji and the little stars
surrounding him. Personally I prefer 0.5 and 0.7 tip sizes so I'll be switching
the 0.38 ones received in this pen. Something to take note is that when writing
with the pencil tip, don't hold your grip too high up as my knuckles
accidentally retract the pencil at certain angles."
ADR in NY,"January 26, 2020","This review is about this pen's hybrid/emulsion ink and not the pen barrel
itself. What I love most about hybrid ink (with blue being preferred over black)
is its deeper color than that of ballpoint (oil-based) ink along with its
ability to be highlighted over immediately after writing, especially when
writing with the 0.38 mm tip. This is a quality I have learned to be grateful
for and appreciative of, especially considering the wait time necessary to
safely, with absolutely no smearing whatsoever, highlight over gel ink. Some
time, at least 10 seconds, is needed to pass before highlighting if using a 0.5,
and 0.7 mm tips and more if using a 1.0.  While I agree that gel ink produces a
more deeper and vibrant color and would ultimately be the one I choose for
everyday writing, hybrid ink gets very high marks for how long it lasts, its
richer color than ballpoint ink, and its ability to hold up extremely well to
water and water-based highlighters. Hybrid ink is my recommendation above all
others for students and extensive note-takers."
mrsbeaver,"July 10, 2020","Pros:- Gorgeous color and great use of graphic design and illustration incorporated
to represent Kiki's, perfectly. - Comfortably placed gel cushion for grip and comfort. - Weight to pen, especially where gel grip is located (real metal used in this
area), so no worries of pen constantly rolling around on table. Still manages to
feel weightless and natural in hand when writing, too.- Ease of use when switching to different color barrels.- Ink quality is there and comes out smoothly and writes effortlessly. - Pencil feature is sturdy and works perfectly well. I've never had a multi-pen
have a pencil option, so this is pretty neat! Cons:- My only real complaint would be that of the gel grip. I keep it in a
relatively covered case/pencil+pen holder, but dust and other tiny, tiny debris
still manages to find its way onto it and make a home. This isn't the end of the
world by any means, but it does become a chore to try and clean off. So, it does
raise a little concern of how long this material will last before it starts to
corrode – as I've had happen to other gel grip pens of mine in the past –
and becomes sticky or more unmanageable debris begin to get stuck to it. All in all, a great, quality purchase that I would definitely invest in,
especially for other big Ghibli fans out there! "
j3ssic4kes23,"November 21, 2019","This has been my go-to pen so far. I'm a student and I use this for school to
write notes. I love how I can quickly switch between the pen colors and the
pencil. Such smooth writing! However, at times, depending on the angle that
you're writing, the ink flow is not consistent. But that doesn't happen often.
Overall, I love that it has Kiki's Delivery Service on it and the color! I've
gotten compliments on it."
torik5,"October 26, 2020","I’ve wanted this pen for awhile, and it does not disappoint. The ink does

than the Uni pen that comes with the Hobonichi.I’m knocking one star off as the ink skips every now and then. I’d have to
go back and write over the lines but it just ends up not looking great.Surprisingly, the Uni pen that comes with the Hobonichi feels better and

gloomfilter,"December 29, 2009","I've tried to use the Hi-Tec-C gel pens. They start out really nice, smooth, and
inky. As I continue to write with them, however, the lines become more faint and
eventually I cannot use them at all - I am left with a nearly filled ink
cartridge. ): I've tried my best to revive my pens, and I have not yet been
successful. Maybe it is because I write with more pressure? Or it is because my
pens come from Taiwan? o_O I don't know. But, my Sliccis never do this to me -
so now I use Sliccis exclusively. So 5 in the beginning (because it writes so
well and smooth), a 1 in the end (because it is useless and makes me feel
sadpanda)."
bleungzorz,"February 3, 2006","THESE ARE THE BESTBut i must confess ^ that they do get clogged up with dried ink bits and paper,

Hi-tec-Cs and pentel hybrid technicas, both clogged up, and found out the ink
was old. lol believe it or not, sometimes pens get old. So what i do is get a
cotton ball of rubbing alcohol, poke it with my pentip for about 30 seconds, and
its good as new. Flows great after!"
hippocheese14,"October 29, 2010","Great pen, writes well, desperately needs a better grip for extended writing. One of the better pens I have used, but I frequently run into problems with the
ink drying up and requiring a fews seconds of scribbling before ink starts
running again. The tip of the pen is definitely intimidating, but it produces a minor
scratching feeling whenever used to write, and that may turn some people off. A
little annoyance for me, but no real big deal. Don't expect to write with this pen for too long, as the barrel is very thin,
and the design just starts to hurt your writing hand after a short while."
CarveYourOwnPath,"April 30, 2009","Too scratchy when writing. Plus, at times, the .5mm one gives out way too much

a little scratchy (so I will only save it for situations I truly need the finest
of detail) but the 0.3mm writes like a dream! It's smooth as butter and so far
I've had no issues with skipping/blotching like some other 0.3mms I've tried. "
erc,"January 15, 2022","I purchased three of these gel pens (.25mm, .3mm and .4mm) for pen and ink
drawing thinking they would be easier to carry than Sakura Microns. They work

this is ameliorated by the fact that the ink takes considerably longer to dry
before you can erase any pencil layouts. Despite that I like them."

hoangnhu.20040,"June 2, 2020","I underestimated the size of the pen since I don't really like to use super thin
pen. Although it's 0.3mm, compare to other pens with the same size, it's still
too thin for me :( If u like a big smooth one, I would recommend up-size 0.5mm"
askronnie,"September 30, 2019","I LOVE the smooth very fine lines of the Pilot Hi-Tec-C Gel Pen (.03mm or
.04mm). For drawing fine details or making quick notations, this is about the
ideal gel pen for me. I have not experienced any skipping or slow starts with
this pen. It's earned a prized spot in my art-senal."
elizahuang10102,"September 5, 2019",a little bit of skipping but its still really smooth 
nmholbrook13,"July 13, 2019","Very smooth to write with, dark and precise ink that dries fast. It is a needle
point pen, so I would not recommend this for someone who writes with a lot of
pressure. "
Finn,"November 24, 2018","I'll start off by saying that I don't usually write reviews. When I do, it's for
VERY good reason.This pen was sort of an accidental find. I wasn't expecting to get another pen
(I was looking for Mildliners), but I saw how tiny its tip was and, being
obsessed with tiny tips and thinking it'd be nice to have a pen that matched my
0.3 lead pencil, decided to take a chance. I got a black 0.3 and a brown 0.3 at
a Japanese bookstore in my area. I tested them out in-store (as well as almost
every other pen there), and I found it was incredibly smooth in writing, didn't
skip, and was essentially a perfect fine tip ballpoint gel pen. For the record,
the 0.25 was a bit too scratchy and skippy for me. It was just too thin to be
functional, and I'm not heavy-handed. But maybe that was just a bad tester.
Either way, I felt the 0.3 was a good balance. I also noticed--as I WAS
originally shopping for Mildliners--that it held up pretty well under them.Fast-forward to the present day. I've been using this pen for eh...a year and a
half or so, pretty constantly (I'm a student and an author...so lots of
writing). It's my absolute favorite pen, and a few of my classmates have tested
it out from me and they love it too! One of my professors keeps two or three in
his shirt pocket at all times. It's lightweight, but has enough weight that I
can spin it between my fingers comfortably and without it flying. I HAVE noticed
that I need to be careful and let the pen 100% dry before I go over it with a
Mildliner, or it can result in minor streaking. That's easy enough to do though.Furthermore, I recently had an unfortunate incident with a broken water bottle
in my backpack. The entire bottom half of my notebook got soaked, and I spent a
good hour or so drying it out with a hair dryer. But let me tell you--I had been
writing in that notebook with a combination of my black and brown Hi-Tec-Cs,
Sakura Pigma Microns in varied colors, Copic Mildliners in black and cool grey,
Zebra Mildliners, and a black Preppy Platinum fountain pen. NOTHING BLED--with
the exception of the brown Hi-Tec-C, but that's for another review. Nothing I
wrote in the black Hi-Tec-C so much as blurred. There was a little bit of bright
pink that leeched out at the edges of the ink, but I'm counting that as a win in
my book, quite literally.But both my black and brown Hi-Tec-Cs are nearing the end of their ink supply,
and I needed a replacement. I can gladly say that I replaced both pens with the
exact same model. It was THAT GOOD. Plus I grabbed a couple more in different
colors (light blue and blue-black)So, TL;DR: This pen is amazing and well worth it. If you're debating it, stop.
Get the pen.5 stars for exceptional smoothness, tip and barrel size, comfort,
waterproof-ness, compatibility with Mildliners, and ability to hold up to my
heavy usage until its ink fully ran out."
tinaisbell.ti,"September 17, 2018","This has become one of my favorite pens to write with, in the 0.3 size.  It does
write smoothly, and I like the needle-point tip, but I noticed that if I'm
taking a lot of notes during a lecture there will be a brief moment when the ink
becomes light and the ink doesn't want to come out.  It only lasts about a word,
and happens after a page of constant writing in small font.  A big benefit is
the geometric shape (the shaft isn't round) and how thin it is; great for
writing at length.Ultimately, though, I would buy this pen again."
electricpenguin,"June 13, 2018","This is like writing with a needle. It's so fine that the black ink looks a
little gray next to black lines from wider points. However, it's a joy to write
with, and brings out details in your writing that would be lost with a wider
point. "

Jessica,"September 11, 2016","I love how smooth and thin I can make lines with this pen. I wish it came in

instead."
Tanz,"July 25, 2016","While these pen work great upon first buying, when they don't, it is rather
annoying. I've been using these pens since they were first advertised on
Jetpens. Fast forward some years later and more experience, I'm finding that
these pens dry out in a year. Maybe I just don't write enough, but I never get
to use up all the ink. Considering that they're $3.50 still, compared to a $1
Papermate, I would expect it to kind of last the same? I've always bought the
really thin .3mm ones, and very nice when you want to take notes in a small
notebook. Even great for use in sketching and doodling artwork. Or just artwork
in general, but not recommended for permanence as these inks are not waterproof.
They will smear with water and copics or any alcohol based markers. I really do
like them when they work. Ink dries up pretty fast; I don't really have smearing
problems unless I'm writing on a glossy paper surface -- they don't absorb well
on those of course since its gel. But now that I'm older, I don't take notes or
write as much -- I definitely don't write with these as often because they're
not waterproof like my Noodler's or fountain pen carbon ink. But good for
writing quick notes and carrying in your bag since they're a good size."

Myrmidon,"June 2, 2016","Great pens. Got here really quickly (thank you, Jet Pens)The 0.3mm pens are prone to 'drying up' I have been blessed with this batch - no drying up! I have terrible handwriting and these pens allow me to read my own work. Be careful - these pens are prone to being 'lifted' by co-workers, if you leave
them lying around."

Charlotte Ng,"April 5, 2016","Lines are too thin, and it's too scratchy when writing as well."
dorn9503,"November 12, 2015","Despite giving it only 3 stars, I did enjoy this pen.  It writes in a smooth,
fine line, allowing me to fit 6 lines of text in a single standard rule notebook
space.  On 'semi gloss' workbook paper, I did have to blot in order to avoid
smudging while the ink dried.  Out of ten different pens I ordered to test, this
one is in the short list of keepers.  At the time of this review I have yet to
test the Hi-Tec-C .25mm, but given the performance of this pen I have have hopes
for that one.  This is the first of 6 pens tested and reviewed so far that
doesn't have a rubber grip.  I mention this because I really hold onto my pens. 
I try to consciously relax my grip, but my hand just naturally clamps down on a
pen.  That being said, I really felt the grooves cut into the barrel to be the
grip.  After a couple days of use, they weren't noticeable, but if you have
sensitive skin/hands, you may wish to take that into considerations."
joseprta,"April 21, 2015",Love the smooth lines. My sketches come out so clean and professional.
Kris,"March 13, 2015","I find this pen to be nearly perfect. I've grown to prefer marker pens but I
haven't used a better gel pen. I think this width is perfect for someone who
writes lightly (I find the .25 to be a little too thin for regular usage).
Sometimes a little scratchy but generally a beautiful smooth line."
foxymophadlemama,"October 4, 2012","An overall solid pen that i don't mind writing with.  These pens are good at laying down a nice, consistently thin line, which is nice
when i have to write in hangul or tiny in general. They tend to write a little
scratchy, but nothing I can't tolerate. The tips are pointy and delicate. I've had several of these pens ruined after
they rolled off my desk tip first onto an unforgiving industrial tile floor. I
guess they're a bit like drafting pencils in this regard, so do be mindful of
the tips.  B+ would draw nude pictures of girls on public transport with this pen again.  "

further..."
hartzog2000,"August 28, 2008","I like this series of gel pens. I have all 4 nib sizes. The nib, some say, is
fragile but I don't believe that is the case, at least not in my experience. I
don't have to press hard to get them to make a mark so I am less likely to break
the nibs than someone with a heavy hand. If you treat these pens right they
perform just fine. The 0.25mm nib of course makes the finest line and the 0.5mm the widest.
However, and it should come as no surprise, the smaller the nib the ""rougher""
the pen feels when writing with it. However the nibs being smaller in diameter
than other pens their nib size they make for excellent drafting/drawing pens
when you use a straight edge such as a triangle or ruler. Again one does not
have to press hard to get these pens to produce a line. The ink in these pens is dark and the pens write without skipping or the ink
running out unevenly. The ink supply is typical of such pens, maybe a tad more
generous. The clear plastic barrels have a ribbed surface for grasping near the
nib. The are as comfortable as any plastic barreled pen or pencil. The only
thing that could make these pens any better is to make the retractable."
chenthebigot,"July 19, 2008","Okay, so I just got this pen from a friend who went to Japan and brought back
some pens.First of all, I would like to say, that this is a bit scratchy.It writes EXTREMELY well though.It flows well, it has good consistent ink, and it does not smear. The irks in this pen, at least for me, lie in the barrel and the point.The point feels delicate, so it just doesn't feel natural sometimes.The barrel feels somewhat cheap, and I don't really like the grip. It is just
raised plastic, so if your hands ever get sweaty, then it gets uncomfortable. Still, it is very recommended!"

zoeypeacock28,"October 5, 2007","i love hi tec c's, so when i found some foray pens at office depot i got
excited... .3 mm, and they looked ALOT like hi tec c's (exact same barrel,
slightly different cap) . they were only 9.99 for 8, in different colors so i
decided to try them out. basically to see if they would be good to hold me off
when i run out and can't get a order to jetpens right away... well, don't waste
your money on the knockoff's!!! the ink in them is so watery, it spreads all
over the paper and you end up with a line like a .7 gel pen. there is also less
ink than in a hi tec c, and i'm sure they'll end up running out alot faster as
well. so.... just a little heads up for everyone out there. you get what you pay

normal pens except for the curiously higher price, but it's completely worth it.
I've been searching for something thinner than the bleedy pens sold at .5mm here

ambrosefu,"September 4, 2005","I LOVE these pens. I refuse to use ballpoint pens for taking notes in class.

rebjlee,"June 9, 2005","I have only had that problem a couple times with these pens and I go through
them quite quickly. If it does happen, I am usually pretty succesful in
replacing the tip with one of the pen tips I have used up...then it works just
fine. You need to be careful not to bed or crush the tip. It is a possibility
you may be pressing hard when writing?"
waylo,"May 31, 2005","These pens are remarkable. My mother brought me back a 10-pack from Taiwan
several years ago and that's when I first discovered them. Anytime anyone
remotely related/friendly to me goes to Asia, I beg them to bring back ~30-50 of
these things. There, they are $0.50/refill. The ONLY problem I have found, and would love to see if anyone else has had this
issue, is that with with the 0.3mm black, after only several days of use, the
tip ""clogs"" up and I'm left with a useless, fully charged ink barrel. This has
been happening inevitably, without question. I have tried to ""scientifically""
analyze this problem (well, as much so as one can analyze pen clogging!), and
have come up with no answers. I've tried cleaning the tips, removing the tips
and washing them (that isn't easy), removing tips from other working pens and
replacing them (very difficult as the tips tend to bend), and replacing tips
using those from other colors (it seems to ONLY happen with blacks). Nothing has
worked. My guess is that ? paper fibers get jammed into the tiny tips of these
things and the pen is ruined. This has happened with pens obtained both overseas
and from Japanese import stores here in the states. Maybe several bad batches? This latest trip to Asia I discovered the 0.25 and managed to snag several of
those. Time will tell if those have the same issues. For the time being, I've
upsized to 0.4mm. We'll also have to see see if these remain patent."
seraph96,"April 1, 2005","I'd heard around that the Hi-Tec-C is great for sketching and I heard right. I

without worrying that I might run low. Thanks again for carrying these!"

ekove,"October 23, 2008","This pen wasn't as good as the 0.4mm original hi-tec-c. To begin with, the grip
is cheap and no good, period. Also, the tip isn't that comfortable while drawing
with, it keeps piercing through my paper, I know it is a thin one but I haven't
had this problem with any other 0.3mm from any respectable brand. The only
reason I gave it 3 stars is because it still has the same nice ink as 0.4mm. I
recommend just sticking to the 0.4mm, it doesn't make that much of a difference
anyway if you're just using it for sketching/writing."
ragdolleye,"September 3, 2008","I have been using G-Tec C4 pens and Pilot (Precise) P-500's and finding the
Hi-Tec-C was great fortune. I have seen some say that the Hi-Tec is the G-Tec
with a different name but this is far from true. The ink in the Hi-Tec is far
less soluble than that used in the G-Tec and Precise pens (I think the Precise
is the American version of the G-Tec as the ink behaves very similarly). This isn't a knock on the G-Tec or Precise pens, as there are uses for smudging
ink. If you would like to wash sketches a bit - the G-Tec and Precise pens are
for you - but not the Hi-Tec. The Hi-Tec is awesome for a fine line that won't smear or smudge. It also works
great in Moleskine Sketchbooks and Cahiers. I got both the 0.3mm and 0.25mm
Hi-Tec pens and the 0.25mm is ludicrously fine."

mercury,"December 5, 2014","This set introduced me into the world of brush pens and now I cannot understand
how I lived without them. Somehow, these have replaced my normal pens. Now I use
them for any writing I have to do, whether it be notes or letters. I have not yet tried the famous Pentel pen but the Pilot Pocket Pen is something
that draws oohs and ahhs out of every observer. However it is something one must
really get acquired to using. Writing kanji with this pen is a dream but writing
in  English or drawing feels very unusual and is quite hard to do.Since the softer brush pens are something I still have to get adjusted to, my
favorite ended up being the Zebra pen. It flows beautifully but is still easy to
control. However the ink does tend to bleed through the paper a little. I always
use both sides of the paper so it is important to me that I do not see the text
on the other side through the paper. Because of this, the Zebra is tied with the
Tombow pen. Although it is only marginally, the Tombow pen does tend to bleed
through less, which is almost never. Between the Zebra and the Kuretake pen, I feel that the Kuretake pen is a bit
more soft and wet, but that is barely noticeable.  "
greyfluff,"January 7, 2015","I have been curious about brush pens for quite some time, and this sampler pack
is a perfect way to try out a surprisingly wide variety of brush pens.  My
favorite is the Kuretake, for its silky smooth writing and its hard fine point. 
The Zebra is a close second--almost as silky smooth as the Kuretake.  The Tombow
writes well and has a slightly thicker point than either the Kuretake or the
Zebra.  The Pentel and Pilot are both soft brush pens.  Those of you who are
familiar with brush calligraphy will be familiar with how they write.  The
Pentel has a wider diameter than the Pilot.  I found the Pentel squeaked on the
paper, which was hugely distracting.  I also prefer a finer point, so the Pilot
was my preference for the soft brush.Whatever your likes/dislikes, if you want to try out brush pens out of
curiosity, for writing, or for drawing, this sampler set is an excellent place
to start!"
percy1pie,"December 2, 2014","A strong variety of brush pens, ranging from firm to soft brush.  Getting this

PinkPrincessia,"April 24, 2016","At first I had found the Kuretake Brush Pen (Fine) harder to work with because
it felt stiff to me, but after a while and some use it became more flexible and
it became easier to work with. The being said the pen works really well for smaller things like facial features
and detail work. But it isn’t a pen that I would use to ink an entire piece,
It is amazing for more delicate work . I probably wouldn’t use to do longer
and quicker lines. It isn’t a favorite out of this set, and I’m not sure if I will be
purchasing another one once this one runs out. But only time will tell, I might
warm up to this pen as I use it more.Impatience and the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen are not friends. The ink runs
smoothly on this pen, and just like any other brush you can have a wide range of
line variation. Before this pen. I had used brush pens before but nothing this
brushy (if that even makes sense), but I think it will be fun to learn.I’ll come back to my thoughts about this pen after I learn to control it more.The Tombow Fudenosuke Brush Pen was one of my favorites! Controlling this pen
was a piece of cake, and the ink flows so smoothly. I found the brush nip to be
firm but not as firm as the Kuretake or the Zebra pens but there was still some
firmness to it which I found to be just the right amount for my needs.The only thing that I do not like about this pen in particular is that it is not
refillable, but once it runs out I will be buying myself more.I feel like this
pen is slowly going to become a favorite of mine.I ended up liking Pilot Pocket Brush Pen (small) more than I did the pentel
brush pen and if I had to choose between the two I would definitely pick the
Pilot one.The Pilot is smaller in length than the Pentel, and it fits nicely in
my hands. The brush nip is also smaller which I found easier to control.The sad part however is that this pen is not refillable so I have to  buy a
whole new one once the ink runs out. Which I shall be doing for sure!The Zebra Disposable Brush Pen, was another fav I didn’t like it as much as I
did the Tombow,This is another pen that I am not sure if I would line an entire
illustration with, but I would use it for finer details like facial features and
ruffles. or maybe shorter hair. Nothing that involves long and quick line work.I think that this is a pen that would be more used for writing rather than
illustrating. I am also not sure if I would purchase another one, once the ink
runs out in this one, I might grow to love this pen, and decide that I can’t
live without it. Only time will tell.Over all I really enjoyed this pen set!!."
dkirk.art,"April 25, 2016","Nice mixture of pens. There were only 2 pens with really brush-like tips.

concept of including several items that are similar, so they can be compared -
however - some people, like myself, are not looking to compare them but to use
them all in their own ways. I somewhat wish that three of the pens were not so
similar. Although in the descriptions of the pens they each have their own
characteristics, in reality the Kuretake Disposable, Zebra Disposable and Tombow
Fudenosuke pens are so similar that I can't tell the difference if I switch pens
mid-sketch. I hope the next sampler I get has more variety."

perfect. 2.Kuretake disposable pocket brush fine is my second choice for line inking. It
is a bit softer on the tip compared to Zebra. 3.Tombow is just a bit too soft.  Actually Kuretake No. 7 has the same feeling,
if not better. And it has the cartridge, which means a lot to me. Personally I
would prefer Kuretake No. 7 over Tombow GCD1124.Pilot Pocket brush is a little awkward where it's standing. It's felt tip
brush, but it's too big making its tip very soft. It's not as nice as the pental

everything I needed to know. I'm planning on buying another set soon and so I'd
highly recommend these!"
grumpybear19,"April 6, 2022","Loved all of these pens! I like how it comes in a sampler so you can try
different types of brush pens"
melanarbs,"April 1, 2022",Versatile and very good sampler to see which brush pens suits your writing

shanna.holden,"August 3, 2021",How lovely to get all 5 pens to try out and see which kind will be my favorite

mariela.alatorre98,"April 2, 2021",Great variety! All of them are easy to work with. 
marcelleqb,"March 22, 2021","Worth the value. I thought I'd end up picking one favorite, but ended up liking
multiple pens. "
gloriasemail2,"January 27, 2021","I really like the pens from JetPens and will definitely be back for more! There
was a small issue with one of the brush pens but I soon discovered that no one
has better customer service!  Not only does JetPens have great pens, but also
people who genuinely care about their products and service. Great products, fast
shipping, and amazing customer service. Who could ask for more?!!!"
wasatchpink,"December 26, 2020",My artist daughter was thrilled with her gift.
mjseka,"September 17, 2020","Aside from the fast shipping......I know I'm not alone in treating my pens as though they are magical gifts.So, I'm not going to be embarrassed by saying I have a special holder for these.
Each of them were welcomed into the family, and while I love them all
unconditionally, the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen will be getting refills over and
over and over until the bristles wear out.The Pilot pocket brush is also awesome to work with; the video provided for this
bundle demonstrates all these pens so accurately.The versatile trio of synthetic tip pens (Kuretake, Tombow, and Zebra) are
workhorses, and I'll be getting a lot of use out of these as well. Great for
detail, and the tips respond beautifully and subtly to pressure; I'm getting
really cool results with the use of pressure and speed variation on all of
these.Thank you, JetPens!"
amsscalise,"September 8, 2020",5 stars
good2sew,"July 23, 2020","All the pens are really smooth to write and draw with. I'm very happy with them.
And just a note about the cartridges that come with the Pentel brush pen...
there are only 2 cartridges. The pen didn't have a cartridge inside when I
opened the package. I say this b/c I'm used to products that say '2 additional
refills included' or something like that, so I was expecting 3 cartridges. Oh
well."
raspberry13,"June 11, 2020","Lovely, fun to work with. I love the variety and would buy again!"
TVCalligraphy,"June 1, 2020",Awesome starter set
alysyngs,"May 30, 2020","Gave me multiple new pens to try! Would’ve liked to have seen a little more
variance between the five as I feel I recurved two similarly short brush pens,
and then three that seem to be the same length but different styles! All work
great and would recommend to others!!"
irmainez89,"May 29, 2020",Great variety! Loved them all. 
bbrachman,"January 1, 2020","The variety of brush pens gave me a good idea of what type of tip I can use
easily.  Some are soft and some are firmer.  I really like the feel of 2 of
these pens and the rest I can learn to use.  It is really fun to play with new
pens."
meganmgrant,"December 26, 2019",Awesome gift! 
jdj247,"November 9, 2019","Love the variety in these brush pens. They all have some specific use in
whatever I write on. "
Julierph,"November 6, 2019",Nice assortment.  Thanks for making these try-out packs available.
mr.alumbrados,"October 21, 2019","These pens are excellent. I love these guys; such a good variety, too."
Vivian,"September 3, 2019","Great set of brushes pens! I am new to lettering and had a lot of fun trying
different tips. "
laird.cummings,"August 21, 2019",A nice selection of pens. They cover a range of uses and line-weights.
bmorrisphoto,"June 12, 2019",Very nice set .... send more so i can draw
har626,"March 2, 2019","I love this Pen Sampler. My only problem is how soft the Pilot Pocket and the
Pentel Brush Pen tips are. It might be user error, but as something that was
listed in the Calligraphy section I was expecting it to be functional for
calligraphy. I have yet to be successful in using the Pilot or the Pentel in
making calligraphy. The other three pens though are great! They can't be used
for large lettering since they are finer tips, but they work wonderfully
compared to the Pilot and Pentel. I would recommend this Pen Sampler if you need
some black brush pens to practice with if you're starting out in hand-lettering
or calligraphy."
SarahM,"February 6, 2019","I ordered these for my teenage son. I wasn't sure quite what to get, so I sent a
message and told Jet Pens about his interests in pens and certain styles of
handwriting. I got back a very personalized message telling me that this set was
a great start, and other recommendations fitting my needs were made as well. I
really appreciated the response, especially near the busy holidays. I felt their
prices were very fair, and I wouldn't hesitate to order from JetPens again in
the future."
bptracer,"February 5, 2019","SOOOO much bang for the buck! I keep this group of pens as go-to's for all
occasions and assignments!"
Billy Ocean,"January 18, 2019","Each pen in this group offered something completely different. I'm glad I got
this sampler pack because I would have otherwise never tried any of these pens.
I just wish there was a way to know what to call each pen (there are only Kanji
on all of them) so that I can re-order individual ones. Side note, these are
technically for calligraphy but I've been using them for drawing. "
pam.falcioni,"January 4, 2019","This is a wonderful sampler with some really great pens I wouldn't have
purchased separately. I'd tried some other brush pens in the past without
finding any that really fit my needs, but three of the the five in this sampler
are just awesome for me and I'm using the heck out of them! The Kuretake is my
current favorite, but I'm also learning to love the softer Pilot brush for
adding detail to watercolor work."
sandy.n,"October 22, 2018","This is set is great. Getting some of these pens in store to try can get
expensive. Better to get it from Jetpens. "
Astro,"June 11, 2018","Perfect way to get started using brush pens! I've been wanting to start using
brush pens for a while, but I didn't know where to start so this is great for
those getting into brush pens. Honestly my favorite ones out of the set are the
tombow fude soft pen (I loved it so much I got a separate set of them) and the
pentel pocket brush pen, but they're all great for their own uses! Amazing set
at a good price!!!"
muddy6,"June 6, 2018","I tried several of these pens almost immediately.  The descriptions of them on
line are accurate.   Some of them are firm, and some of them are quite flexible
and juicy.  I am delighted with my purchase.  I can make thin, then thick, then
thin lines with some dexterity.  But my learning has some improvements to
achieve--although this is not the fault of any of the pens."
Tink,"June 6, 2018","This is my first brush set and I wanted to sample them to see if I would like
any of them. I am so glad I did they came with a good variety to have a feel for
it. It came super fast too a lot faster then the expected shipping date.
!!!!!!!!"
polog90_08,"June 3, 2018","I really like the samples you can try out the different styles of pens. I only
use 2 out 5 because I'm not comfortable with others just yet. It's more of
mastering the technique and not a stiff hand. I need more practice to get
better. These are cool if you don't know what style of brush pens to use for
beginners."
stalk_dcampos,"May 7, 2018","Great selection of pens made even more worth it by the inclusion of the Pentel
Pocket Brush. If you want a good sample of the brush pens available this is the
best choice for you. "
amsscalise,"April 12, 2018","This group of pens is fantastic for someone who enjoys messing around and having
different options. The pens are diverse and its an absolute deal for the price
you pay!"
Jessica,"February 26, 2018","Man oh man, this sampler was one of my first-ever purchases on JetPens--and I
still use many of these pens today! It's a great little set if you're just
starting out, or if you're looking for some diversity in your brush pens. Worth
every penny, then and now!"
nalalion,"February 23, 2018","This is such a cool idea. Rather than paying to buy each each of these pens
individually to try them I got to try different ones to figure out my favorite
for less. As a beginner with these pens it was a great deal. I would highly
recommend them. "
sutterhouse401,"February 23, 2018","I really like these pens.  I would recommend to my friends or family. If you are
an artist I recommend you also try this collection.  "

cemaurus,"February 21, 2018",These were a great Variety to get started with Caligraphy and brush lettering.
dreamer0201,"February 2, 2018","When I got the sampler set in, I was on the first leg of getting the
flu/cold/upper respiratory stuff and was stuck in bed for days. Perfect for
playing with new art toys and I did! I have continued to play and play and play.
They are wonderful and so much fun!"
stationeryangel,"January 24, 2018","Jetpens Samplers are so fun!All the pens have been really great. Although the really realllly soft pen is
too hard to use ;'( "
Myrima,"January 12, 2018","A good sampler for those new to brush pens. Each pen have their unique
characteristics that easy to see in side by side comparisons. "
jeff_grabner,"January 3, 2018","Too many similar styles. A challenge to accomplish this technique but stay
focused."
houska-77,"December 22, 2017","My daughter thought this set was pretty fun, because it had different sizes as
well as different brands."

when you’ve never tried any of these or want to expand your collection! "
emmett.catedral,"November 15, 2017","Great value for the selection. I honestly got it mostly so I could get the
Pentel while getting a bunch of 'extras' for only a few bucks more. Makes no
sense to buy the pentel alone when you can get all these at the same time."
lds lvs pencils,"October 28, 2017",great pens and great service.
zaidauhsoj,"October 24, 2017",Love the second set. But both contain the greatest pens I've used.
crista.cmd,"August 9, 2017","I've used the pen Zebra for many years in drawing and lettering and wanted to
try something new. The other two fine pens are a lot of fun, the Tombow is quite
flexible and give a lot of variation. But I was most excited to try the Pilot
and Pentel pens, with large flexible brushes. They are very different, from each
other and the other pens. The Pentel's fine hairs makes large gestural marks
easily. The solid tip of the Pilot is more controlled, but also offers a wide
range. I look forward to using all them more!"

lot to determined what works for me. I now have a favorite pen, and a least
favorite pen... but they are all pretty great at one thing or another. I
completely recommend this to anybody who wants to explore brush pens and inking
with no prior experience."
peggy,"June 16, 2017","Really am enjoying this sample of different brushes.  I've been using them in
some urban sketches and find the brushes to be a great complement to the
watercolors I carry.   The brushes were well packaged and arrived earlier than I
expected.  Am always very pleased with my orders and how quickly they are
shipped.  Thanks to the staff!"
ariadna.harrison,"May 30, 2017","Best purchase I ever made. I love jet pens and every product in this sampler set
is MAGNIFICENT. Best deal you could ever find for these wonderful wonderful
pens!!! I would do it again a hundred times!"
gangsterowl72,"May 27, 2017","These pens are amazing, I am so happy that they came in a variety, so that I
could try out more then one style."
keithcieplinski,"May 26, 2017","These are perfect! This was my first time using brush pens and I will definitely
get more. I'm able to use the pens to write calligraphy (Chinese characters) and
for my drawings. I got a good idea of the world of brush pens and I'm really
enjoying it."
jlwilliams010,"May 6, 2017","A must buy! The Tombow, Pentel Brush Pen Soft, and Kuretake fine tip are the
real gems of this collection. But I do illustration, so don't take my word for
it, get one yourself. You'll be glad you did!"
kl_trnr,"April 18, 2017","This is a great set to get started. One of the pens I don't care for but 4/5 is
a win for me!!!! The pen I don't like isn't because it's a bad pen it's just
because it's not beginning friendly for brush lettering. But if you need brush
pens for something other that that it's a 5/5. "
adnohcs,"April 6, 2017","great collection of pens, it took me a long time to finally find some ink pens
that worked for the type of illustrations that I do.  Thank you for posting
these on Facebook.  I am very happy that I found these and will reorder as I
need them.  So happy!!"
mwmiller,"March 24, 2017","I have used the set several times now, and am loving them. This set can handle
most any inking situation I have encountered, and excelled at creating the lines
and effects I am shooting for. I have found the larger brush pens dry slower,
resulting in some smudges. I would chalk that up to user inexperience with the
pen, and no fault of the pens themselves. very good set, and I recommend it
highly!"
me,"March 23, 2017",Great way to try brush pens! Only one that I don't love...yet!

Every. single. pen. EVERY. ONE. was awesome and wrote beautifully. I will
definitely be ordering more!"
Carlie,"February 21, 2017","This is a fantastic little arsenal of pens! It's perfect for anyone, no matter
your brush pen proficiency - whether you're looking to try out some brush pens
for the first time or just want a bundle of decent brush pens with good variety,
this is a pretty great deal. (Yay automatic free shipping!)For newcomers, there's not too many pens to be overwhelming, and it's easy to
tell them apart from one another at a glance. Each one of them is a completely
different experience to write with, which is pretty neat. You get all kinds of
brush materials and ink, so you can see if you like firmer or softer brush tips,
wider or narrower line shapes, thick or thin pen body, etc. Even for someone like me who was already familiar with using a brush pen, it was
great to take a peek at what other options I had been missing out on! Definitely
check this sampler out."
Lizard Party,"February 19, 2017","Very good price. Amazing pens.   This grouping is comprised of very good sought after brush pens for an
amazing price. I ordered this set after trying and liking my first ever brush
pen. I was not disappointed, I was blown away with the variety. There is a lot
to learn from trying this variety pack. I highly recommend this for everyone."
iandross1978,"February 18, 2017","Excellent selection of pens. They really are a variety from tight felt tip to
wonderful, loose brushes. I think the Pilot Pocket Brush is my favorite so far,
but they are all getting a lot of use as I practice Japanese characters. Great
value for money."

xombiehamster,"December 13, 2016","I had no idea that there were brush pens that weren't like the fragile mess that

two more than the others, the Pentel is really becoming my go to pen of
preference. The video on YouTube did an excellent job showcasing their function
and usefulness. Will definitely purchase again."
tinachance,"March 29, 2016","I'd never used a brush pen before, but was interested in learning. Although the
guides on this site are very helpful, with zero experience of the pen type, it
was hard to know what to choose. This sampler is a great assortment for
experimenting with technique and learning about the tools. There are a variety
of tip types to try out, and I learned a lot from this sampler."

juliabrown1,"December 29, 2015","The two brush pens are especially (the pentel and the pilot) amazing.  They are
new favorites.  The others don't feel particularly brush-like to me, they're
just sort of more responsive markers, but they're nice pens."
cherietrudeau,"December 8, 2015","Great ink flow from every brush pen and flexibility as described! I definitely
recommend these"
laragann,"December 2, 2015","great quality! some might not have a continuous flow of ink as you write, but
other than that this is a GREAT deal."
CajunCajoleArt,"November 23, 2015","This sampler was recommended to me by an art friend online, swearing that I'd
love them. Well, he was right. I love them! They're all different from each
other, but have an important function for what type of art you're doing. I
prefer the Zebra, Tombow and Kuretake for my outlining and the other two for
wispy works such as hair or inking large areas. The control and handle of these
pens is fantastic. The nibs on the Zebra, Tombow and Kuretake are springy, so
they never lose their shape and you can get into the finer details with the
sharp tips. The fact that they don't smear when I apply my Copic or Prismacolor
markers is a HUGE plus. I'll definitely be getting some more of these pens in
the (near) future. Thanks JetPens! You've gained another satisfied customer!"
eric.schweitzer,"November 11, 2015","Never used brush pens before, so the sampler was appreciated. The brushes are
all quite different, some harder to write with than others, which is why the
sampler is nice."
caledscratch,"November 2, 2015","I am new to brush pens in general, and I found this set while I was trying to
find a single brush pen that suited me. This set is great because of it's
variety, every pen is slightly different and it was great for me to see which
pen I liked best based on real experience. While I have my favorites, they are
all great for different things and it's very fun to have the whole set on hand
to play with."
Jellydoodles,"October 15, 2015","I just received my JetPens Brush Pen Sampler and let me tell you how happy I am

recommend them. "
luigizus,"October 5, 2015",Great starter pack
christenmu,"September 19, 2015","I gave 4 stars for now since I haven't tried all of the brush pens yet, but
tried the Pentel and love it. It's easy to use and the fact that it's waterproof
allows me to do water-color washes on the drawings. Great line work for
sketches. Will be trying out the rest soon."
ashleyhhart,"August 19, 2015","a great variety for someone looking to try out brush pens for the first time! i
liked the Tombow Fudenosuke Brush Pen Soft the best but unfortunately can't
purchase replacements on the site since they are no longer available. That one
was the best out of the set for beginners trying calligraphy though!"
gutierrez81,"August 18, 2015","If you have not used brush pens and aren't sure what you'll like, this is a
great starter set of pens. It cut down on the time I spent researching pen
options and let me decide what types of pens work for me by letting me take them
on a test drive so to speak. Some of the pens are easier to use as a beginner
than others so it also works out that I started practicing with particular pens
and then move on to others. Practicing with different pens has forced me to pay
careful attention to my developing technique, too. I highly recommend."
troy,"June 26, 2015","I am very happy with this purchase. This was a great way to try out several
brush pens without breaking the bank. I had very little experience with this
type of pen before as I wasn't willing to spend much $$ just to try out one pen.
I would recommend this purchase to anyone in a similar predicament. I found one
I like quite a lot and am confident that this selection gave me enough of a
spread to do so."
Sheffield,"June 15, 2015","A great selection, a perfect way to sample a variety of brush forms."
phillip.mcdonald86,"May 28, 2015","the pen arrived quick. in great condition with there was a translation for the

before you use it"
jfrancis,"May 7, 2015","This is a good assortment for finding out what you like and don't like in a
brush pen. There are five pens in the sampler pack all together: two of which
resemble brushes, and three of which are more like soft, flexibly-pointed magic
markers. From among the soft pens, I personally preferred the Pentel Pocket
Brush Pen for my style of work. From among the harder pens I liked the Tombow
best. They are all fine pens but everyone has his or her preferences."
Hideko94,"April 19, 2015","Best sampler collection ever! I love each of them. I don't write, only use them
for casual writing and calligraphy. Depending on individual that you will find
your most favorite and comfortable, but to me, each of them has different,
unique usefulness. I think with these 5, I will not need to buy anything else
(unless I start taking up ""heavy"" Chinese/Japanese calligraphy).Totally worth it!"
rapidpunches,"April 17, 2015","Pentel pocket brush was nice. The other four pens--were barely water resistant,
smeared, and the pilot had the greatest tendency to bleed. Other than that the
four are great for dry brushing. The strokes get misty and dry if you draw fast.
Short slow strokes retain solidity. Kuretake was a good medium brush pen.The variety is there."
jordiwaggoner,"April 1, 2015",Gives you a chance to find out what you really like. I loved the sampler
bponshock,"March 24, 2015","These pens are ""Awesome""!  I am a cartoonist and have never used brush pens
before, but I just love the Pentel pocket brush pen and Pilot brush pen.  As you
may have read in other reviews, it does take some getting used to, but the
linetype possibilities are endless and beautiful!  Thank you JetPen... I will
definitely be a repeat customer.  Also, thanks for the quick delivery!  I
ordered on a Thursday, and received the pens on Monday."

Mitch K,"January 3, 2015","Great set and really good for the beginner to figure out what they like. I hate
the pocket brush at the start purely because I couldn't use it. I watched some
youtube videos and was amazed at how good people are with it. Now it's my
favourite brush pen and purchased heaps of refills so I can use it non stop. "

are Pental and Tombow. Great flow along with gentle handle. A nice change of pace that goes
well with fountain pens. I mainly use them for Kanjis."
camyolakit,"December 9, 2014","Got my set in today!!! I have been just testing them out by scribbling so far,
but I feel and see the potential I have in my hands now. I am learning how to
draw Manga and other forms of the art of drawing. I have many art supplies (in
regard to markers & pens) already, and this new set of brush pens has really
motivated me create and express myself through their usage in addition to my
other tools. I am loving the Kuretake and the Zebra brush pens equally. The
line-width variation is perfect for Manga creation and detail. The tombow is
good as well, but its line variation seems to start off a little thicker than
the Kuretake and the Zebra versions. I also love the Pentel brush pen(hard). I
sampled it first and for the longest. I already had the other Pentel brush pen
in my arsenal, so now I have two: One for my travel kit: and the other for my
at-home usage. This sampler pack was a good deal! I am inspired and motivated
and can't wait to get the time to get started. Thanks JetPens."

gweakles,"November 2, 2014","All of these pens are amazing. I originally only wanted to try out the Pentel
brush and pocket brush pens, but it was the same price for the two with shipping

cealder,"October 13, 2021","Trying so hard to love it. So scratchy. I have the fine nib. I cleaned it out
and swapped out cartridge and still ink flow is minimal. Hurts my hand after
writing and feeling like I have to press hard. Not a good experience. Maybe I
need to try a medium nib. Not sure what else to do. I’ve tried on tomoe and
Moleskine and other paper and nothing works. Very frustrated. Maybe I got a dud.
Sad face. "
SavageX89,"August 16, 2021","Quality pen. Easy to write with. Comfortable to hold. I was hoping it would feel
heavier in the hand than it does, but still feels good with the cap posted on
the end. Would recommend for sure!Note: the writing example shown in the pictures uses alternative ink and higher
quality paper. When using stock in on regular 20# printer paper, this pen writes
more like a medium nib than a fine nib. If you plan on using this pen on regular
printer paper, go get the extra fine nib. If you're going to use it on nice
quality paper, this will probably produce lines more like the writing sample. "
David,"March 16, 2021","My $0.02…The Safari is a comfortable, durable, and reliable pen, and a joy to write with.
As someone who uses the tripod writing style, the Safari’s unique triangular
grip fits my hand like a glove (as a point of reference, my smaller sized hand
would always get sore after writing for a short time with my Pilot
Metropolitan).The Safari has become my everyday pen over the last six months. I write by hand
more frequently now because the Safari experience is so enjoyable. As for the
nib, I have small, precise handwriting and have always gravitated towards the
finest of points, so I started with the Extra Fine nib. The only slight drawback
to it was some scratchiness, both the physical feeling of the pen on paper as
well as an actual scratching sound. On its own, this wasn’t quite enough to
try the Fine nib – but, when I decided to add this limited addition Terra Red
Safari to my collection, I went with the Fine, figuring I could always swap
around the EF and F nibs if necessary. That said, the Fine point is fantastic
– it’s considerably smoother and quieter than the EF, and any sacrifice in
precision is minimal at worst. The F puts down a line that is only slightly
thicker and darker than the EF. Whether or not you’re new to fountain pens, I wholeheartedly recommend the
Safari. "
riochowdhury,"February 28, 2022","Terra Red also feels like terra cotta, like the flower pots."
kulinp,"November 26, 2021","Bought this and another Safari (Savannah, Medium nib). Great way to get both new
releases with a couple of different nibs to play around with and replace a
decade-old LAMY (unknown model) that I was growing a bit tired of. Pen works
great. The F nib has a bit of feedback which I actually rather enjoy. This is an
awesome addition to my small (but growing) collection, which also includes a
TWSBI Diamond 580."
lutiancheng2015,"April 13, 2021",I love this pen. 
100 Friendly Bees,"January 10, 2023","i'm in love with these pens. it's up there with my TWSBI ECO T in terms of
niceness. i was hesitant at first with the ABS plastic body - it feels light and
my brain wants to equate lightness with cheapness, but it is honestly really
nice. made me like it more to know it's the same material as lego, hehe. the nib
feels super good, inkflow is incredibly even and controlled, not too dry and not
too juicy. perfect for writing. this is my main everyday pen nowadays, and i
absolutely want more colours.one thing i did do - the angled grip area feels sharp along the seam edges - i
took a blade and ran it along those edges to strip away the flash. it worked
great, looks great, and feels way better. especially since i'm a lefty and hold
it a bit odd anyways!"

colegaston,"April 11, 2021",Looks good. Feels good. Two weeks in with daily use and it's holding up great. Little pricey maybe..
wittwer43,"April 16, 2018","The pen came much sooner than I expected; it arrived in 2 days. I'm extremely
pleased with quality, as it as good as or better than my other two Vanishing
Points, one with a blue carbonesque with fine nib and the other with a black
finish with a stub nib. . I was so pleased with the fine nib that I decided to
get another one on the Raden. Vanishing Point nibs are smooth writers and have
an excellent ink flow with no hard starts or skipping. For a long time, I didn't
buy a Vanishing Point despite excellent reviews, because I thought the clip
would get in the way. In my case, the clip doesn't interfere with my writing at
all; I compare it as being somewhat like the ""triangular"" grip of the Lamy
Safari, which I also find comfortable. "
tleebrooks,"February 10, 2022","Beautiful pen. The gold nib makes for a great writing experience. Just plain
lovely. "
JuliS,"November 11, 2022","I got the green glow and wanted the purple glow too.  Unfortunately there is
something wrong with the nib (scratchy and low flow on down stroke) and as
someone who is new to fountain pens, the best I could do was to swap the bad nib
out with a good nib from my clear ECO (same nib size).  (Watched on YouTube how
to do it.)  Now it works well, but now my other Eco fountain pen needs a
replacement nib.  This is a problem with the manufacturer of the nib and not the
quality of the pen or shipping from JetPens.  The glow is indeed blue, but does
not last as long as the green glow.  I didn't buy them for the glow feature so
to me it is just a perk.  I am still happy with my pen and I learned more about
fountain pen nibs."
togotooner,"November 3, 2011","What makes the Zebras a step above my previous favorite Uniball brush pen is the
mere fact that they are re-usable!All I did to mine was remove the back cover, tap out the sponge reservoir and
drop some PERMANENT ink into the sponge with a dropper (took just about 5 drops
to really saturate it) and the pen was back in action with the added bonus of
permanent ink!! "
annjob,"March 20, 2013","This pen has successfully replaced my whole set of sakura microns at a fraction
of the cost! No longer do I have to switch between pens to get line variation,
rather, with a simple flick of my arm I can get a beautiful tapered line! I have
also noticed no bleeding which combined with the fact that it appears to be
completely waterproof, makes this pen a keeper! Unfortunately my review isn't all praises.  After a bit of use I found that the
tip has worn down quite a bit, but that is to be expected of a disposable pen.
The pen also isn't the best to sketch with due to the fact that the ink doesn't
seem to flow fast enough for me. This also means that it probably isn't the best
pen to take notes with for all you journalists out there looking to buy a nice
pen.Finally, I have found that none of the Zebra Brush Pens could compare to a
real brush, so if you are looking for a pen to replicate that feeling for
calligraphy I would go with a pentel pocket brush pen. This pen has however
filled a nice little niche as my go to pen for more detailed work and for
lettering! All in all, I will definitely be buying this pen again. At 2.50 a piece it is a
steal!"
t.truman,"March 8, 2011","MY FAVORITE BRUSH PEN FOR COMICS AND ILLUSTRATION. I AM A PRO COMIC BOOK ARTIST
& ILLUSTRATOR. THE ""FINE"" AND ""EXTRA FINE"" ZEBRA BRUSH SIGN PENS HAVE BECOME MY
MAIN INKING TOOL. THE TIPS OF THESE ""SUPER FINE"" ZEBRAS ARE SO STURDY AND
RESPONSIVE THAT I USE THEM FOR DETAILS THAT I USED TO DO WITH A CROWQUILL PENS!
(PS- A FEW ""TIPS"" FOR SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS: 1) I ALMOST NEVER HAVE TROUBLE
WITH THE TIPS FRAYING, BUT ON RARE OCCASIONS WHEN I DO I FIND THAT SIMPLY DOING
SOME ""ROLLING"" BRUSH STROKES ACROSS A SHEET OF SCRAP PAPER WILL USUALLY PUT
THINGS BACK IN ORDER. 2) IF INK SEEMS TO BE SLOW OR THE TIPS DRY, I DIP THEM IN
WATER OR A FEW SECONDS, DRY OFF ANY EXCESS WATER, DO A FEW PRACTICE STROKES ON
SCRAP TO MAKE SURE ALL THE WATER IS GONE, AND THEN TRY AGAIN. IT USUALLY WORKS.)
PS- THE GRAY INK VERSION IS AMAZING FOR HALF-TONE WORK, BUT SADLY ARE NO LONGER
SEEM TO BE AVAILABLE FROM JET PENS.  ASIDE TO JET PENS: PLEASE (!!!) MAKE THE THE GRAY INK ""FINE"" VERSION AVAILABLE
AGAIN IF POSSIBLE! I CAME TO DEPEND ON THEM FOR MY HALF-TONE WORK AND MISS THEM
MUCH! THE KURETAKE GRAYS ARE GOOD, BUT THE COLOR OF THE ZEBRAS WAS MUCH MORE
PLEASING AND VERSATILE.)"
theashenge,"January 25, 2012","One big problem. Unfortunately, it's a big one. When these pens are good, they're really good. They get the strokes finer than I
can with the sharpest lead, and that's absolutely incredible. And vital, once
you come to expect that of it.  But for every super fine pen I've received in the mail that fits the bill,
there's another that seemed busted or dull at the tip. This downgrades it to a
simple ""fine"" version of the pen. And that's not what I have in mind. There
doesn't seem to be any way to guarantee this won't happen. Fortunately, they're
inexpensive for such a fine pen. When I bought more, I did it in bulk just to
heighten my chances of getting the fine tip I hoped for. It's simple
dice-rolling. If you've bought said pens and never had this problem, I'm happy for you. But at
the same time I'm really jealous. I have no idea what you do differently to
avoid this problem. D:  Excellent pen. Glaring detail lost in the shuffle. 5/5 for when it works. 2/5
when it doesn't."
Moebius,"March 29, 2008","This is easily the best ever drawing pen [sort of a felt tip brush pen] that I
have ever used. And I have used many different types, from France, Germany,
Japan etc. This one is the mother of all drawing pens. Can also be used for
other stuff such as caligraphy and any work where you need variation of line.
Easily can go from thin to thicker line. Perfect for comics, manga etc. Hobby.
This pen is a secret by many artists who ordered it via 'special' connections
from Japan and now available finally on JetPens. BTW, all other brush pens from
Zebra are great and I use them all but this one is used the most together with
fine and medium one completes a perfect set for drawing. Highly recommended."

jamiehamilton3999,"December 9, 2021","Most of my artwork is done in ink, and I use these pens every single time. The
variation in line width is perfect for fine details. They dry fairly quickly and
are waterproof, so they are perfect for watercolor and marker artwork. They
always ship on time and I have never had a problem with them. Whenever someone
asks what art supplies I use, I recommend these every time. "
wmineo,"December 13, 2019","These Zebra Brush Pens have become my main tool for outlining when inking. They
give a crisp, clean line with just enough flexibility to feather from thin to
thick, much like a crow quill pen. My friends who've tried them, also enjoy the
feel."
Larchitect,"July 1, 2019","I love these pens but they leak for me after only a few uses. I imagine others
have this problems as well. If they didn’t leak they would be a solid 5 stars!"
Cammiluna,"July 5, 2018","This has been my go-to brush pen for two years. I would buy one along with a
hobonichi techo to do daily drawings. Then I moved onto watercolor sketchbooks
and this pen works so well with them. My only issue with it is that the sharp
point wears down after a few months, so I have to keep replacing it even if the
ink doesn't run out.  Still, it's been way better than carrying technical pens
in 6 different sizes."
leebcgfx,"January 9, 2018","Bought all the sizes of this brush.I find them to be just OK for what I like to do in making marks. So I ended up
going back to regular brushes and dip pen. On some paper that is low lb. weight,
these should do better than a dip pen because they are not as wet. You won't get
the spider web edges.I can see how they would be good for lettering if you like the quick chop look.
I'll keep them of course, as you never know when they'll fit the job."
angle13_13,"June 30, 2017","Of the two competing lines of disposable pocket brush pens (Sailor and Zebra,
which manufacture all of the same sizes), this size is the only one from the
Zebra brand that outdoes its Sailor counterpart. The Sailor version of this pen
is more like an ultra-fine-tipped Sharpie marker. This pen here, however, has
the same size of nib, but a slightly different shaped tip. This difference in
shape allows for a bit of flexibility, which creates interesting line variation
and depth. Even though the difference seems small at first, the flexibility of
this pen lends itself nicely to inking larger illustrations, and adding boldness
to existing lines. The ink in this line of pens does well on many surfaces,
except perhaps laminate, or anything with a high gloss like Scotch tape. Even
after the ink dries on those surfaces, it will rub completely off. "
marzthetrekkie,"June 28, 2017","If you find long brush nibs difficult to control for lineart, I strongly
recommend this pen. The nib is excellent and I can get the control I want
without sacrificing the varying line widths that are so iconic to the brush pen.
It's still malleable, but way more stable. "
maybarbara,"June 21, 2017","A little surprised by how fine this pen is. The tip is almost like a bold
ballpoint pen in thickness and lends itself more to small details in sketches,
notations, and bullet journal needs. Not the best for calligraphy because it's
flexible but small tip doesn't create much size variation. "
angelwhohasfallen18,"May 7, 2016","Best pen I've used for inking illustrations. I've always used technical pens and
decided to try something new. Best decision I made."
alexa.cook,"April 21, 2016","This is a nice pen with dark black ink. The brush is too hard for me to use for
brush lettering, but it's still very good for writing. "
bilojorna,"April 9, 2016","I was looking for an alternative to finicky brushes, rapidographs, and pen nibs,
and this came close. Depending on the pressure used, it can put down a line that
varies from thin to thick. It would've been perfect if the ink flow was heavier
and darker for my illustrations, but it's still a very good disposable brush to
add to your collection. "
morefunthanwork,"March 30, 2016","I love this pen. It writes a deep black, crisp fine line with no feathering on
any paper that I've tried so far, that includes cheap copy and filler paper as
well as better smooth asian papers. There is no a lot of variation, but there is
enough to give some character to the line. I wish Jet offered volume discounts
since I'd like to buy a box of these. "
peachy,"December 24, 2015","Okay, but, in all honesty though, I can't tell the difference between the tip on
this pen and the small tip on this pen:

ded-Fine-Medium/pd/13538 . I think maybe the ink is a bit different, and maybe
this tip is softer, but to me it's relatively the same. Either way, this pen
writes well and as others have said, works great for inking drawings. "
james.hodge1994,"December 3, 2015","These are some of the best pens I've ever used for the inking process. Despite
drying almost immediately, I usually like to wait a day after I ink before
coloring in my doodles. The only issue I've had with these pens so far is that
I've found if you retrace over ""wet"" lines, the ink blotches out and leaves huge
globs of ink. I've ruins three doodles so far, but I'm only still learning.
Other than that, they're absolutely brilliant and I highly recommend them to
anyone!"
Yannick,"April 10, 2015","I like this pen, line variation is easy to achieve and it writes smooth. My only
problem is the felt tip began to erode a bit."
richardpace,"March 19, 2014","I bought two Zebras along with two each of Sailor and Kuretake brush pens.  In
order, I preferred the Sailors most of all with the Kuretakes least. These Zebras, fine and super-fine, have a nice stroke compared to the Kuretake's
scratchy line, but has a similar grey/thin ink. If jetpens are out of Sailor pens, I would get these Zebras as alternatives. These are used for drawing, not writing."
vectrexlover,"April 20, 2012","    PROS   Nice flow of ink   Perfect for making characters/drawing   I like the glittery blue body   Affordable :)   Disposable   CONS   If you draw a line too fast for the brush it could easily fade as you press on
the paper   A bit gritty when you press on paper   Overall worth the affordable price and enjoy using it    "
stationery soldier,"December 15, 2022","This is my favorite brush pen I have ever come across. The ink is very good, and

would say this one is in the middle between the hard and soft fudenosukes, and
firmer than the Pentel touch"

because I wear it more than writing with it. This pen has style and flair in its functionality!!"
s.zmarin13,"February 17, 2020",Perfect for those who love writing. 
flatw00ds,"January 10, 2020","Wonderful pen. I hate that it's disposable by design, but felt pens are often
like that. I would draw with this all the time if I didn't feel rotten about
throwing them away so fast, so instead I just save them for certain details.If you letter comics or want to accent brush pen lines with something that has
similar line variation in a smaller scale, these are excellent."
nanalise123,"January 4, 2020",firm and versatile

carriekingsley,"November 2, 2019",Writes nicely
Larchitect,"October 23, 2019","I really want to fully love these pens but every one I have purchased leaks
after a few uses. The ink drips out and becomes blotchy. I can only recommend
with reservations. Hopefully others have not experienced this issue. "
nickname,"September 20, 2019","This pen is great! Not the best for calligraphy, but does the job. I would
recommend this to an artist, but if you would like to use it for calligraphy go
ahead!"
vangpn1,"August 1, 2019","The nib is pretty sturdy and flex back really fast. Overall, similar to Tombow."
Babyshark ,"July 11, 2019",I’ve ordered countless of these in the past and they never let me down 
Taryn,"July 3, 2019","Gorgeous. I was looking for a firmer, waterproof brush pen and this one is
great. It's more stiff than the Pentel Fude Touch that I've used to try out
brush pens in general. The black is rich; it does lift some with heavy erasing,
but it's lightweight and moves fluidly across the page. "
nana.chan4002,"June 18, 2019",Works amazing!
christalyeager123,"June 15, 2019","I don’t normally write reviews on anything but I recently got these pens and
holy moly they’re the absolute best writing utensils I’ve ever used and
I’m so happy I ordered them!"
djortiz.21,"June 11, 2019","Prefect exactly what I wanted. Didn’t bleed through paper and was extra fine
tip and really smooth. "
hannah.lorali,"June 6, 2019","Pen draws smoothly, brush tip allows for different sized strokes. "
julia.artery67,"June 5, 2019","I love the pens. I ordered two and they shipped relatively fast. I use them for
both drawing and writing because they work nice for everything. They don't bleed
through thin paper and dry quickly so they don't smudge. My only issue is that
occasionally the pens seem as though they are drying out. However if you just
give them a second, they continue to work nicely. This rarely is a problem."
quilivi,"May 14, 2019","I love these pens. They're perfect for my larger water color pieces, and just as
nice for small pen sketches. The variable line width brings a lot of personality
to the work. I plan to buy more when my current ones finally run dry."
Ickabod,"April 29, 2019","The pen tip was dry and near dead when it arrived but after a lot of coaxing I
got it to work. In my effort to see what the pen could really do at full
effectiveness, I ignored all the other pens I had ordered until I had gotten
this one to work; and this pen quickly became a fast favorite! It's a very
versatile pen, and is a pleasure to work with!"
joanamiranda,"April 20, 2019","I love this pen and plan to order more of them.  I use it for my smaller scale
cartooning and really appreciate the waterproof black ink and the ability to get
line variation. "
padded,"March 20, 2019",I am on my 2nd one..and have a 3rd backup for when the 2nd dies on me...love it!

give just a little flourish to something."
jackie_n_lady,"January 30, 2019",Nice and easy to write with. Perfect for beginners 
velocirants,"December 7, 2018","It brushes, and it pens.A lot easier to control than I expected. Feels really good. I've avoided felt
tips for a long time because I thought they'd feel gross, but this pen feels
really satisfying to line in. "
renataeric65,"November 30, 2018",Love the thin lines it can create. 
Demi Kookie,"November 10, 2018","Firstly, the body of this pen is absolutely gorgeous! It reminds me of a starry
sky, and is a nice touch where you're taking pictures haha. The nib of this pen
wears down extremely quickly. First, it'll become more blunt and much softer but
later the ink will start clunking up and making very scratchy marks. However,
since this pen is so dirt cheap, I'll give it a pass. Overall recommend! "
jessicabhatem,"October 15, 2018","I love that this pen is a little stiffer than other brush pens I've used in the
past--my shaky lines are looking a lot more purposeful! Also love that this pen
arrived earlier than the anticipated date. "
afreemanjoy,"October 7, 2018","I really enjoy this pen, love the variety in lines it can produce and will
definitely be buying another when this one reaches its end!"
alacalihoma80,"September 23, 2018","Didn't care for it, it didn't seem like it was full of ink, I had to go over
place where it didn't write well"
galabent,"September 6, 2018","This might be the best pen in the world. Has variable line weight without being
sloppy-- goes from delicate thin to juicy thick and maintains this capacity
through the life of the pen (doesn't get frayed or dull). Also, as the ink
eventually runs out, the line quality gains a new interesting texture. I buy
these in bulk so that I have them in various stages of inkiness."
xxjeyxx,"August 18, 2018",Writes smoothly I like it a lot
meganecrouch,"August 9, 2018","The tip doesn’t stay sharp once you use it a few times but otherwise it’s a
good pen. Great for bold sketching. "
the3ooknook,"August 9, 2018",This a beautiful shade of blue that doesn't run.
ThatNerdTori,"July 2, 2018","This is my first brush pen, so I'm sure it's just a learning curve, but I do
find that I need to apply quite a bit of pressure to get line variation, much
more than I expected. Overall, I like this pen and will be practicing with it!"
lordeathman,"June 29, 2018","SO GREAT, needs broken in a few minutes, but an excellent pen! "
Shinomiya Mika,"June 26, 2018","It is so beautiful when I write in calligraphy. The thinner strokes come out
amazingly and the thicker strokes are the perfect thickness every time! I would
definitely recommend this."
musicallygeared,"June 25, 2018",Lmbo i write a review for the other pen BUT I LOVE THIS ONE TOO!
Kay Gonza,"June 19, 2018","Was introduced to this pen thanks to Thomas Romain on YouTube. In his tools
video he had shown this particular pen for his artwork. The brush tip is firm
for control but it is flexible enough to get thicker lines. It works marvelous
with watercolors and I've had no issues with copics and the like."
the.lunatic.pandora,"June 16, 2018","I feel like I could get less variation in the line weight than I expected, but
still a very decent brush pen. "
Tina,"May 10, 2018",The tip deteriorated easily and original thinness becomes thick
jhicks61,"May 10, 2018",Super fine is great for filling out forms and very tiny writing.
reyesgomezmegan,"April 26, 2018",Super good for line art and very good for beginners!!
y.a.moustafa25,"April 17, 2018","Amazing pen! Very steady, and great with inking small details!"
no name,"April 13, 2018","I love the line quality of this pen! The only thing is that it's not very good
for hatching or anything besides lining, because when you do fast strokes you
don't get very much ink."
MWIllustrations,"April 4, 2018",Another brush in heavy rotation with my supplies.  Great for the fine details.
layne.student,"April 4, 2018","I use it for almost all of my calligraphy and handlettering. It's smooth and the
ink is amazing quality. It doesn't bleed and barely ghosts through any kind of
paper (even cheap notebook paper.)"
mcriederer312,"April 1, 2018",Good flexibility.  I love the fact that it is very black.
veckizyt123,"March 19, 2018","Very fine and easy to control brush pen, Great for detailed work and can get
some fairly thick lines. It is also very waterproof and has fast drying time."
slipcat,"March 19, 2018","A good pen for smaller drawings  (say 5""x7"" for example)  VERY similar in
function to the  Pilot Fude Makase Xtra Fine pen. Treat the pen carefully (same for the Pilot Makase Xtra fine) and do not ""mash
down"" on it,  and the nib stays responsive.A very good pen, just cannot do long lines very well. "
carlos_pagano,"March 10, 2018",excellent product
trishastaley,"March 6, 2018",Love them!
heroud,"February 27, 2018","I liike it. Very fine and detailed and still have the look of a brush stroke. I
would prefer this over a 0.5 multiliner for comic or manga.I only could wish it has a little bit more ink wet, but still, solid buy."
Soapykitchen,"February 5, 2018","This is #2 of my top 3 favorite drawing pens. I hate leaving my house without
it. It’s pretty water resistant, I use it with watercolor and marker a lot.
It’s great for cross hatching and drawing wrinkles in clothing. "
mvocouch,"January 24, 2018","Very pleased with this pen. Nice thin lines but with line variation. Definitely
my go to when inking details. Comparable to the Tombow Fudenosake Brush Pen in
feel but with a finer tip."
LanLan,"January 10, 2018","the lines are very super fine, nice for hair strands and fine detail"
brushpenaholic,"January 4, 2018","It was a great pen while it lasted but it didn't last very long. The nib wore
down very fast and there's still plenty of ink left. For me if the nib on a
brush pen wears down with moderate use before the ink runs out, it renders the
pen useless. It's possible I was pressing down too hard while using it, so I
might need to order one more and keep track of my use to judge if it's the
quality of the nib or the heaviness of my hand. The ink is a nice dark black
through and I could get really neat lines with very subtle line variation. This
pen might be worth a try if you're a beginner or want a thinner, much firmer
than average brush pen."
nayitas,"December 26, 2017","Very usefull and easy to use, perfect for illustrations and caligraphy, high
recommended."
E M Jensen,"December 18, 2017","This pen is absurdly useful, and even left alone in a bag for a year, it works
great."
Fancy,"December 4, 2017","As an artist I would only use this for doodles and mostly writing but it writes
smoothly."
mcmanusx,"November 27, 2017",nice.
estherjiwon94,"November 11, 2017",Great pen but sometimes the ink overflows in the nib.
djayarr808,"November 8, 2017","This is a little niche item for me.  The ink doesn’t flow as much as I’d
thought, but I’ve found that at the right speed, it’s perfect for scratchy
hatching and crosshatching for my manga.  Stuff like hair, some clothes, energy
waves, etc.No give at all, just a Cheap and disposable, cool little felt tip pen."
kittredgelukman,"November 7, 2017",my new favorite pen
meganrieman2018,"November 1, 2017",excellent pen!
annalisa,"October 25, 2017","The super fine point is probably my least favorite of the 3 pen weights for the
type of drawing I do, so I've been using this pen for writing notes or in my
planner instead. It is REALLY fine. "
jtadcock,"October 19, 2017","Surprisingly great.  Tip is very easy to work with.  This was my first
experience with a brush pen, and I've really enjoyed it.  The ink is very well
behaved and does not feather even on cheap legal pads; there is some
show-through, however, but no bleeding.  Dries very quickly and is completely
waterproof.  Great pen. "
Kathy,"October 18, 2017","A great beginner pen for brush pen lettering. Very firm and not flexible enough
to give depth to the letters. Fun to draw with : D "
mechesontrance,"October 9, 2017",Incredible pens! Best things I've used. :-) 
majesticsunsetbeach,"September 19, 2017","I have tried this, the zig pens, and the pentel touch. This is my least
favorite, with the pentel touch being my favorite. The zebra is still quite
excellent but not my fave in terms of how I write. Depends on your use of
pressure I guess."
anttieklund,"September 12, 2017","The best all around brush tip pen for me. The tip doesn´t bend like some of the
others and gives a nice line with subtly undulating thickness. The tip is fairly
thin so you cannot get extravagant differences in line width, but that is
exactly what makes it most usable for everyday use. It´s great to make any hand
drafted notes with lively writing and fast and easy sketches. It´s great for
tiny drawings that you can scan and autotrace to your computer. Gives me a pause
from all the mouse work I have to do and keeps my hand agile for drawing and
painting."
Bepis,"August 5, 2017","This Is my favorite pen along with the mangaka fine pen to use to outline my
copic drawings. These last quite a while and the nibs will wear down however
that does not bother me as it is still able to acheive such small lines."
inschoolink,"July 25, 2017","First time using a brush pen and I am so glad I picked this one to try.  I love
the level of hardness on the tip and it is really comfortable to hold.  Now I
want to order a box of them!"

easily!"
paulprofherbert,"April 17, 2017",Great pen. Would like a finer point and my pen was a little dried out.
jess.smiley,"April 12, 2017","This has become my go-to brush pen. I've recommended it to dozens of my friends
and enemies!"
rachelewheeler,"April 7, 2017","I don't have a lot of experience with brush pens, but I absolutely love this
one. It's firm, but in a good way. I can get varied line widths easily, but
still put down a very fine line without feeling like I'm just hovering and
hoping for the best. The tip isn't overly wet, but not nearly as dry as other
brush pens I've tried. It doesn't leave puddles - or anywhere close - and I
don't feel like I'm raking a desert when using toothy paper."
gina.middleton,"March 30, 2017",Great feel in the hand.  Looking forward to creating great things with this.
sketchingmonsters,"March 15, 2017","After reading so many great reviews, both Jetpens users and famous artists
alike, I decided to order the Zebra Disposable Brush Pen. And after numerous
tests, too numerous to count, I could not seem to get this pen to perform quite
as well as other users/reviewers. It seemed to be finicky about feathering and bleeding on all but the most porous
of papers. Before any person responds saying the tip died because I used the
wrong paper, please understand, I tried everything from Deleter paper to Arches
Hot Press Watercolor Paper before discovering on a Canson heavyweight Drawing
Paper (about 110 lb I believe) that would hold a fine enough ""usable"" line. And
once I did discover just the right type of paper, it's tip didn't last past a
simple 11"" x 17"" comic drawing. I truly wanted to love this pen, but I just couldn't attest to the durability or
quality of the tip. Please don't let my review throw you off if you'd like to
try this pen. I just wanted to share my experience out of honesty."
jandro.draws,"March 13, 2017",Really nice for deawing
paulinafricke,"March 11, 2017","Probably my favorite new pen. Love how precise and dark the ink is. Gives good
control, even on rougher paper, and makes nice bold, smaller lettering. I press
hard and the tip has definitely started to wear and tilt to one side but that is
likely due to user error, but something to keep in mind if you have a hard hand.
"
cayt27,"March 9, 2017","Love these Zebra disposable pens! I got one of each and they are perfect for my
drawings! I've used them in my watercolor paintings as well. This size was
perfect for the Christmas cards that I made this year - writes smooth on hot
press watercolor paper. Just give it a second to dry. This pen is in the top 5
of my drawing pens! "
heathwang7,"March 2, 2017","I much prefer the fine over the super fine. This one I guess is meant to lay in
small details as the ink can't catch up with my strokes when I draw with it
normally. I will just stick with the fine."
neo nova,"February 15, 2017","Not quite what I expected. I ordered two of these in high hopes and I've been a
little let down. Both pens are rather dull and the ink flow makes it look as if
they're low on ink. Not a big fan... "
jessie.tran98,"February 2, 2017","I really like the ink and the inkflow. Only wish that I ordered a size bigger
because this is a bit ""too fine"" for me because then the strokes aren't that
obvious(?)"
toyajoyperkins,"January 30, 2017",My favorite out of all the brush pens I own. 
kamenriderneko,"January 27, 2017",Really love this one! Will definitely get another when I use mine all up.

elizabeth.wentworth.226,"January 24, 2017",Great pen. Doesn't bleed and super fine
jnolan0,"January 24, 2017","I've had this pen for two or three days it writes really well but the tip is
already getting dull "
Adan,"January 21, 2017","It's a great pen for detailing and quick feathering. You just have to be careful
to not press on the tip too hard or you will get bloatches of ink on your art.
Other than that, this is a great pen!"
cheeselol.oragami,"January 6, 2017",Great pen! Very fine or thick lines and dark ink.
thegneech,"January 5, 2017","In a world where most brush pens are super-pliant and make crazy-thick lines,
these pens have a fine tip with just enough give to create terrific line
variation without being super-sensitive. For someone trained almost entirely on
pencils or Rapidographs doing illustrative lineart (like me) these are the
perfect step up to a more dynamic style.The only downside is they have a limited amount of ink and the lines to start to
gray/streak after a while. On the other hand, the pens are not terribly
expensive, so you won't go broke grabbing multiples."
lluuccyyll,"January 5, 2017","My new favorite pen! I live in a dry climate, so I will see how long it lasts,
but so far I love the tip and flow. "
adamferris.se7en,"January 4, 2017","My new favorite pen for inking comics! It's just really amazing, i can get a
nice variation out of it. Perfection! I do wish they were refillable, but not a
big deal since they are inexpensive."
Nico,"December 12, 2016","I don't reach for this pen often. It really doesn't feel super fine, more
medium. Ink flow is great! Not totally comfortable to hold. "
Nina,"December 1, 2016","One of my favorite brush pens. The ink is dark and the tip is precise enough for
detailed writing and drawing, but also with a little pressure, can be used like
a brush to create strokes. I've already purchased a backup!"
jpruitt0692002,"November 24, 2016",This is my go to inking utensil for all my comic and illustration needs!
romevi86,"November 23, 2016","This is a great little brush pen to start learning to use and it's very cheap,
considering it's dispensable."
RAPIDPUNCHES,"October 4, 2016","Do not let heavy handed artist friends borrow this. The felt tip will grind
down! "
doodlin4ever,"September 21, 2016","Super fine brush pen, I really like this one. A great pen for very fine linework
where you need some slight line width variance, like hair in cartoon or comic
art. The tip is a more firm brush pen type, helps control rendering."
blankdiploma,"September 5, 2016","Extremely disappointed in the pens I received. The texture of the brush tip is
very uneven, so unless I draw excruciatingly slowly I don't get an even ink flow
and my lines are spotty and irregular. Boo."
Croci,"August 31, 2016","For anyone looking at brush pens, these are by far some of the best on the
market.The line variation on these babies is fantastic, they're not too hard or too
soft and are very easy to work with. I primarily use these for inking
illustrations, although they're just as great as writing pens. These pens have
successfully replaced all of my technical drawing bullet and brush nib pens. I do think the super fine nib lends itself better to writing than drawing
however, it can get a little scratchy when it comes to longer lines and certain
angles. The super fine is still a great little pen, but I'd recommend the fine
nib for drawing."
jeanbentzen,"August 4, 2016","I really enjoy the tip on the zebra pen. The variation lines you can do with
this pen is amazing."
kiirome,"August 4, 2016","Great pen. A bit thin for my tastes but for those who are looking for this
thickness then it is great. "
kaylager,"July 29, 2016","This pen is so beautiful it makes my writing look nice although I hardly use it
for that only for cards and for when drawing oh it's so beautiful. very crisp
lines and can make them so thin."
KimchiKicks,"July 25, 2016","I wish this pen lasted longer, I've purchased it 3 times. It is however
incredibly addicting and I must say, I LOVE how dark this ink is. Solid black.
The brush pen is perfect for fine minute details as well. I have had no issues
with ink consistency as well. I will keep buying these. The price is right and I take them with me everywhere.
"
dany.coldbeir,"July 20, 2016","Excelente, uno de los mejores que hay.Excellent, one of the better ones out there."
daniellewedding2011,"July 8, 2016",This brush pen is great for handlettering.
cynthiajane,"July 6, 2016","it's a nice brush pen but it takes a while to dry and it smudges. it's not
waterproof or copic proof (when I tried them). "
emilie.baylay,"June 30, 2016","This is my first brush pen I have ever used so if the brush drying out
occasionally  is normal. I didn't like how dry it would get. "
akoszis,"June 26, 2016","An immediate permanent addition to my pen line-up. I was getting tired of having
to pull out and juggle my normal inking pen, and then two fine liner pens for
the smaller details and touch-ups. This one definitely replaced any fineliners I
had, because while its very fine, its also a brush and you can get some variety
of line weight in it. I showed it to my friends and they immediately asked me to
order more for them. "
cc_orli,"June 23, 2016","After only a couple uses, the tip got a little feathered/flaked bit which now
makes ugly little connector lines by all my strokes. I think I can cut it off if
I'm careful but kindof disappointed it happened after two uses. The pen itself
has a nice, fine stroke."
GoldilocksZone,"June 21, 2016","This is by far my favorite pen I own for small lettering. You can get perfectly
defined thick to thin lines, and it can handle the pressure very well. Will
definitely repurchase."
vsock,"June 9, 2016","Great for the price. If you want something with quicker flow & darker ink,
you'll have to shill for something a little more expensive. Otherwise Zebra's
lineup is great for lineart & writing."
Kirk,"June 8, 2016","Can't say anything bad about it. I bought the Kuretake, a Tombow and this Zebra.
Although I prefer the Kuretake, the Zebra is still a solid brush pen. "
tonytagg,"June 8, 2016",wonderful point and smoothness

Kylekhansketches,"March 5, 2016","This pen is amazingly brisk, and the line variations I thought everyone was
reviewing about are no joke. I was surprised at the thin lines that this pen
puts out. I love it, and even though the tip may wear out eventually, I am
looking forward stocking up on these again in the future, but hope it dries out
before it's use does. Hands down, an excellent felt tip pen. "
marywerner,"February 17, 2016","Really like this pen - wish it was refillable but really like how it writes and
very glad I tried it. "
martindnajera,"January 20, 2016",Buena 
DiazArtist,"January 13, 2016","Pretty good pen with a nice tip. I've used them to write some Certificate of
Authenticities and they work well. Eventually the tip gets like most other felt
tips or whatever material this one is made of. The lines end up being bulky, but
still have ink. A very nice brush. I think I've used it a few times on artwork."
james.turner.jr,"December 30, 2015",An excellent pen for sketching and cartooning. Nothing more needs to be said.

gombuk99,"November 14, 2015","The Zebra is very similar to the Tombow hard pen, but just finer. As such it is
a super versatile pen especially for use in drawing rather detailed but small
images, such as faces in a comic panel. It's flexibility allows for thicker or
thinner lines, unlike technical pens, for those tiny nose shadows! "
qkhwaja,"November 12, 2015","Loved this pen.  The only thing was that it was dry, but it was easy to refill
it with ink."
klruth,"November 9, 2015",Smells kind of weird.
rschoenrock07,"November 2, 2015","Easily the work-horse of my pen collection. It has a nice, firm nib with the
right amount of flexibility, and I've found that the ink is darker than the
Sailor's ink. It's also just the right price~very helpful for us starving
artists :)"
mattnelson,"October 3, 2015","I use these and the Pentel Pocket brush to ink my drawings (mostly cartoon
style.) I like the sharp lines and ease of use that the Zebra pens have. Great
for those starting out with brush pens, as I am. "
sketchingmonsters,"October 1, 2015","This pen simply outperforms other brush pens I've tried. I highly recommend the
Zebra for line art. Excellent buy and Jet Pens is an amazing retailer; every
item arrives meticulously packaged and preserved. I'll be buying lots more!"
celina.h,"September 23, 2015",Lasts long and dependable!
courtney98098,"September 18, 2015","Really nice super fine point but not that great for calligraphy because the
brush tip doesn't flex much."
noseln77,"September 8, 2015",I love it! Great pen for handlettering!
Carollowne,"September 6, 2015","Excellent pen...slightly firm tip may be really useful for those just learning
to sketch with brush pens."
flutterwhirl,"September 6, 2015","At first I was hesitant to get this since my most favorite of drawing pens are
black micron 005. However, when I tried this out I was floored by the amazing
smooth way this glides on the paper! I honestly could not stop drawing with this
great pen! The tiny brush allows for some excellent detailing and now this pen
has a place in my case alongside my microns! "

amycluo,"August 9, 2015","Super fine tip that is perfect for calligraphy. The tip seems like it will last
quite awhile too!"
belladumonde,"August 6, 2015",My go to brush pen. Reliable dark black ink with good line variation.
thetinyfoxblog,"July 22, 2015","I love using this for fine lines, just wish it was waterproof ink"
jkgirlster,"July 14, 2015","My favourite pens! I love that the tip doesn't fray or get ruined easily. It
makes an excellently controlled fine line, AND a decently thick line, both with
wonderful control thanks to the firmness of the tip. The ink is nice and dark. I
was gifted this pen by a friend, and had to come back and buy more!"
thirdpotato,"July 13, 2015","Must-have for artists!This pen is fantastic for artists who want detailed artwork with a good amount
of line weight. The pigment is rich and doesn't erase away. It's also water
proof, but let the ink dry well on the page first. Great for heavy handed
artists like myself as well. This is one of my favorite in my collection. "
ryan.edwards59,"July 6, 2015","One of my favorites new. Great line variation, rich black ink, and surprisingly
good at spotting small areas"

vikkimrls,"June 5, 2015",Awesome pen. Very smooth

mark,"June 4, 2015","Amazing pen, but a little too fine for my tastes. Otherwise a top notch brush
pen. Well worth trying."
thecapturedspy,"May 20, 2015",Love this pen! Very smooth. Allows for a lot of detail work.
strychalskikazper,"May 4, 2015","It is pretty good with black ink quality but it can leak black ink easily which
is unfortunate "

akefiasgirl,"April 10, 2015",Good brush pen. Would buy it again
Amdovsen,"April 7, 2015","Better than i expected! This is my first Zebra. It doesnt bleed through my
regular Moleskine. It has a nice firm brush tip. You can get fine lines or thick
lines easily. "
anungunrama,"April 3, 2015",Great pen! And Jet Pens is such a pleasure to work with!
Savvy,"March 16, 2015","The ink is really smooth in this pen. But the nib is a little smaller than
expected, and it's easiely worn."
Samuel_szymanski,"March 11, 2015","Probably my favorite sketching tool. The lines can go from really thin to really
thick with a reasonable amount of pressure. This is a very easy pen to control!
Super fine is my favorite size, I feel like it offers the best range. It's
difficult to get super think lines with larger sizes, but super fine can reach a
pretty thick sized line easily. And another plus, they are SUPER cheap. I don't
intend to ever be without one of these again."
romevi86,"February 20, 2015","Nice disposable brush pen. Probably my only one I’ll own. The other brush pen
I have has refillable cartridges and is made by Sailor. At one point it was
scarce, but now is readily available.So when I saw this disposable one by Zebra I decided to get it as well. It’s a
fine one and definitely a must for those interested in learning about brush
pens."
Howard Tayler,"February 11, 2015","This is one of my go-to pens for initial line art. At its fattest, the line goes
a little scratchy, but for fine strokes the pen is kind of perfect."
robokitty,"February 11, 2015","I love this brush, again like the other zebra brush great for small details. "
ozworks22,"February 7, 2015","A fave, flexible and versatile."
perrinog,"January 31, 2015","Very fine line for a brush.  Intense black ink.  The tip will replicate the mark
made with an .05 Micron pen, but the brush tip (though not very flexible) will
still allow for far more line variation than you would get from a non brush tip.
"
gracesabella,"January 23, 2015","This brush pen is the best! Definitely my favorite that I've tried so far. The
tips is a bit stiff and very fine at first, but it loosens up quickly (after a
page or two). It's still pretty fine but also a bit soft and flexible. Very
enjoyable to write with."
brightworkpress,"January 22, 2015","I've tried a bunch of brush pens, and the Zebra disposable brush pens are by far
my favorites. If you like a firmer nib and find many brush pens too floppy,
you'll probably like these. The firmer nibs give you great control with little
effort. The ink is very black, dries very fast, and – best of all – it's
totally waterproof. You can quickly do corrections with a white gel pen, with no
bleed at all."
joselyn,"January 5, 2015",This is a great pen I recommend this to anyone who draws.
nami,"January 3, 2015","The super sharp tip depicted in the photo wears down after a while, but even
then, this pen is capable of still making very thin lines.  Part of this has to
do with the rigidity of the tip, which gives you good control.  The ink is very
black and fairly water-resistant, if you give the ink a little time to absorb
into the paper (this depends on what kind of paper you're using, obviously). 
The tip seems very tough and can take a lot of abuse, so if you have a heavy
hand, this isn't going to splay like some of the softer brush tips.  Might get a
bit streaky if you sketch very fast."
hgp,"January 1, 2015",Fine as ever!
pbpartido,"December 18, 2014",Incredible variety with this pen!! Definitely should own a number of these.
howdy,"December 1, 2014","A great all around brush pen for the casual doodler to the professional artist.
I've never had a problem with a Zebra leaking or the point wearing out before
the ink supply. I'm not kidding when I say this pen changed my creative life and
took me to new places artistically. "
furthermorepress,"November 20, 2014","I'm really enjoying this simple brush pen; especially for non-everyday
envelopes."
bogmire7,"November 13, 2014","I got this just to try it out, and I absolutely love it. Its so much fun to

terrygarrett763,"November 11, 2014",It's wonderful to have this size.
margie,"October 27, 2014","Nib maintains its point for a LONG time. The ink is very black. For the price
these are great pens for calligraphy and illustration."
nonchalance_is_dead,"October 17, 2014","Where has this brush pen been all my life, and why did it take me so long to
find out how amazing it is? Seriously, the ink is such a gorgeous shade of
black, and the line variety is simply astounding. I'm definitely going to
purchase more!"
biffybeans,"October 10, 2014","Love. A fav. 4 stars because they don't last long and you can't draw long lines
without the ink petering out. "
John Verone,"September 19, 2014","This pen was terrific for a while, it's lines varied which is why i loved it,
but after a couple times using it I noticed that the tip slowly gotten wider and
wider, changing it's lightest width of 0.20mm to a 0.45mm and my lines are now
too thick for my smaller pictures."
liralenli,"October 18, 2013","Great variation of line, nice tip, and feather-free ink. I love it for the
price, too, and it's perfect for my Chinese homework."
larryhuynh.l,"June 3, 2012","Boss! I recived my Zebra Brush Pen yesterday and it is a good brush pen. Almost
everything about the pen is awesome exept for one thing: after a few times
writing with this pen, the ink is almost dead. I'll try to order more."
ivan_mello7,"December 10, 2011","I really liked how it can be so professional and so cheap at the same time!
Awesome brush pen. "
angeles.twu,"July 27, 2011","Very nice pen. It makes everything I write look much sharper and crisper. I get
compliments on my handwriting. I have not had any trouble with streaking."
eryncupcake,"May 16, 2011","Perfect for line variation and such. Kinda looks dry and rough if you make a
mark too fast. Maybe it's just the pen I got. It's really really great for it's
price though! I almost spent $20 for a pen similar to this one!"
emily,"March 5, 2011","It's got a lovely tip and is really easy to control. It dries up a little, very
quickly, so you have to draw slowly with it after the first few days of using
it. Still a really nice pen, though. My favorite. _3"
aikoekadan,"February 25, 2011","This pen has a sturdy tip that doesn't get bent out of shape. The ink is dark
and smooth, and doesn't streak at all. I found it to be superior to the Kuretake
disposable sign pen, and you can't beat the price!"
iluvkevs,"August 1, 2010","A very fun pen =] The ink seems blacker than the brush pens by Kuretake and
Tombow. The line width is very flexible and easy to control. Good pen, I'm
buying more later!"
ipfrazer,"June 19, 2010","Love the colour, for the price, hey, what the heck? Buy this! Very sturdy while writing..."
pikapika123,"May 26, 2010","This is a pretty sturdy brush pen. I use this mainly for drawing. However, one
thing I don't like is that it sometimes comes out scratchy or...bordered.
Overall, I like this pen. I bought a spare in case the one I'm using runs out."
Thomas Schmall,"October 1, 2009","I'm using this since years now after I found them in Japan. After trying
literally hundreds of pens this is the one I stuck with. It creates a great line
- it allows perfect control over the line width, by being a bit firmer than
other brush pens. Additionally it is good for transporting in a pocket - it never runs out (just
sometimes the ink gets very fluid, I have not figured out why yet). It's perfect
if you're learning Japanese writing - learning a nice style and stroke order
will come more natural to you.Only drawback is that the tip quality goes down fast - especially the very fine
top and fluidy goes away fast - you have to switch every month or so (depending
on the use of course). A more durable tip would make this the perfect pen."
k454ix,"August 4, 2009","This pen is great for artists!! It has a nice firmness that allows for lots of
control, but has much range in line weight. I definitely recommend this for
others who love to work in ink and get tired of making 'artificial' line weight
with pigment liners."
ihavecomputer,"April 7, 2009","Pros: I love Zebra and I love brushes so this one's a no-brainer. I use it daily
for sketching (along w/ the medium weight version), writing, even sign checks
with it. The felt nib is firm and bends nicely under pressure, it'll lay down
anything from a thin scratch to a rich black ribbon. Be aware that this brush
differs significantly from nylon-tipped brushes which are softer and more
painterly. Pen construction is solid, stylish, and durable. You will lose it
before it breaks / runs out. Cons: After heavy usage the nib will soften semi-permanently, creating wetter,
heavier lines. Pen is still very usable at that point, I keep them around in
case I need something between Super Fine and Medium.  Verict: True workhorse. Perfect for dynamic line drawings and sketches.Grade: A+"
don,"October 3, 2008","This is the best pen I have ever used for writing Asian characters! It's very
much like using a tiny brush, and the line variation is incredible, from extra
fine to quite broad. Actually, you have to take care not to press too hard,
because you can easily make the lines broader than you might expect for such a
fine point."
kcgreenn,"September 24, 2008","this pen is the bomb. I haven\'t messed with anything else since I got this pen,
it\'s perfect for tight, small work, like comics, which I do a lot of. I really
can\'t recommend this pen enough!! I LOVE THIS PEN"
deborahellenschmitt,"March 13, 2021",great tool.
onejamephilly,"February 5, 2014","I purchased this pen in July of 2012 and have used it as an every day pen since.
This is the first fountain pen I have ever purchased. I loved the packaging. I am not sure that it's packaged the same way anymore.
Generally the pen writes very well My only complaint is that the finish, after much use, is wearing off and showing
the copper metal color of the body. While it doesn't effect the writing of the
pen, it makes it look very cheap and/or used. This is the reason for my 4 star
review. I also purchased a fine nib for this pen. If you're ordering for daily writing,
I suggest the medium nib. I barely use the fine nib. Another suggestion I have is that you should always, ALWAYS, leave the pen
retracted when not in use! Even if you're just shuffling some papers to continue
writing. The nib will bend easily. "
Greg,"November 2, 2018","This is an amazing pen for the right user under a certain set of conditions. The
form factor is nice, heavy and smooth. The ""ballpoint-like"" retract feature is
something you'll wonder how you lived without if you take a lot of short notes
and had no idea how much time you used to waste uncapping, posting and recapping
a fountain pen.The medium nib on the Pilot is pretty FAT. Everyone talks about how Japanese
nibs run small and so it is easy to assume a Pilot medium nib would be
equivalent to a Western fine. It's not. Depending on the size of your
handwriting and the kind of paper you use, small handwriting may be illegible
with this pen because it's that broad. On the other hand, it also conceals small
inconsistencies in my still-improving penmanship so I like it.If you like using bottled ink for the color selection, move along and maybe get
a Lamy 2000 instead. The ink converter experience with this pen is absolutely
abysmal. The supplied converter is WAY too small, hard to fill completely, leaks
if the pen gets bumped around too much and is just plain cheaply made compared
to, say,  a Lamy Z24 converter. And nothing with a converter compares to the
capacity and ease of filling of a piston filler. Bottled ink vs. cartridge ink
pens are two different animals for different purposes IMHO.Pilot's ink cartridge color selection is pretty limited but here's why I'm
willing to live with that. The Vanishing point is a premium fountain pen for
people on the go. This is a pen designed to be an EDC pen for general use.
Nobody who takes notes in meetings/class or fills out business/medical paperwork
is going to want to stop to refill a pen from a bottle of ink in the middle of
the day. Carry a spare ink cartridge or two and when your pen runs dry in the
middle of a meeting, just pop a new cartridge in and resume writing. Done. No
wiping the ink off the nib required.If you want a fountain pen to journal or write letters in your favorite color
ink, use a different pen that you can leave at home in your stationery drawer.
But if you want a bombproof, EDC, retractable fountain pen that writes buttery
smooth, the Vanishing Point is worth every penny."
corrydouglas,"August 10, 2015","My first gold nib pen and I absolutely love it. Feels great, the clip placement
not only doesn't bother me, it helps with my grip. Design is stunning. My only
complaint is that I bought this with a medium nib because I heard it writes more
like a fine. I have to say I am inexperienced when it comes to fountain pens but
I would have preferred a fine nib. The pen however is so great, I may just keep
it and choose my next pen with a fine nib! Amazing service and pricing from
JetPens as always."
courtney.boyden,"May 22, 2022","This is my first 18K nib. I prefer a nice thick nib, and this does not
disappoint. The nib is very wet, writes smooth. I have it inked with Pilot
iroshizuku tsuki-yo. It really shows off the nice shading of the ink. I write
rather large and right handed. My one disappointment is the convertor. It is all
the information that you've probably read up on already. The convertor does not
hold a lot of ink, I have to refill it about once or twice a week (I write a lot
of letters and in my planner). Filling the convertor is easily done, but there
is a long process of burping out all the air so that you can get all the ink
possible. Overall, lovely pen and I'm glad that I upgraded - I love that it's a
quick draw EDC. The matte finish makes it a bit of a looker that most people
comment on as they show up to meetings with their simple rollerball bics (I may
have even made a couple fountain pen converts). I don't have any scuffs or
scratches yet, but welcome them!"

epichero81,"February 4, 2021","I goofed. I was so excited for this pen up until I started writing. I went with
the medium nib because I preferred that over the fine nib but I didn't read the
reviews. This medium nib is not a medium it's a broad. It is very smooth and
nice to write with but I have small handwriting so if I'm not careful it just
looks like an inky mess. I'm now need to buy a replacement nib unit. I learned a
valuable lesson to read reviews no matter what."
matt5544,"August 10, 2020","Writes well out of the box. The subtle matte finish is nice in the hand. The pen
feels cool to the touch from the metal under the finish. "
andrewabbate,"February 8, 2018","Love it! I had one of these pens about 15 years ago, I forgot just how special
they are. I love the new finish!"
tinn,"October 11, 2015","The fountain pen body is matte black, looks amazing. I originally bought a fine
nib, but went back and bought a medium nib instead because I write with heavier
pressure. I liked the medium nib at first, it's good when it works well. But..
sometimes the ink doesn't flow well and I'd get empty lines. Wonder why the ink
flow is not consistent, maybe a bad nib....? I am using the pilot black ink
cartridge with this pen. :( "

spiffdeb,"May 5, 2022","Love, love,love!  Subtle colors and they are much less “wet” than the
originals I bought when this line first came out. These do not leave a puddle of
ink at the center of each dot like the older ones did.  These function exactly
as they should. Clean, neat perfect dots! "
mimharpist,"April 26, 2022","I have been using these markers to ""dot"" my to-do list.  I wanted a multi-color

more bland than I would prefer (I love bright colors), but they serve their
purpose."
mimivirginiadelacruz,"April 25, 2022","These markers are really fun and good quality, but I find them hard to integrate
into my journaling routine, mostly because they slightly bleed through the paper
I use (80 gsm). They also are a bit harder to adapt to than I assumed they would
be, but that's an issue with my skill, not the markers themselves. Overall I
think they're interesting even if I don't use them super often."

offer refills in these great colors. "
davidoneill,"October 26, 2017","So far, I'm mostly loving these pens.  I like having the ability to write in
slightly different colors for differentiating my notes, but still have the ink
look mostly black so it's easy to read.Occasionally the ink will fail to run smoothly leading to a scratchy feeling. 
I'm hoping this doesn't get worse with time (I've had them for about a month so
far)"
patriziarfreeman,"October 19, 2017","There is something deliciously decadent about these pens.  It’s the rich,
black-infused color.  I love them sooooooo much!!!  Might have to get another

Bannef,"August 4, 2017","These are some of my favorite colors (I own two shirts that almost perfect match
the Bordeaux black color), and I love being able to write in my journal with
them. All of the colors look very nice with each other, which I appreciate,
since I will often use different pen colors for different thoughts, and end up
with different colors on one page.The pens themselves are handsome, and I enjoy how they write. My only wish is
that Uni-ball Signo would release retractable versions of all these colors -
currently they sell a retractable blue-black, which I own and love, but I would
like the whole set. I do slightly prefer the retractable versions (RT1 UMN-155),
but that is a matter of personal taste. "
nickhensley6,"May 28, 2020","The ink in these pens is vibrant, quick drying, and the colors are amazing.
These pens would have gotten 5 stars but all of the pens have consistency
issues. When writing, the flow will slow to a stop for a word or two before
coming back. I thought it was just the Bordeaux Black since that was the first
one I wrote with but the issue was consistent across all colors. It does not
happen when jotting down a few quick notes but when writing for longer periods
of time the issue is consistent.  "
public_bob,"October 26, 2017","I am really liking the inks in these!  The only thing I'd change on the pen is
to bring the grip all the way down to the metal.  This makes holding the pen a
bit awkward, and it takes some getting used to.  Otherwise, it's a great pen
that writes excellently!"
Ash18,"January 30, 2018","These pens have started a love affair for me! The colors are just BEAUTIFUL,
like seriously amazing. The Lavender Black is by far the best purple-black ink
I've ever seen. I even find myself reaching for the Coffee Black, which is
surprising because I'm not a huge fan of brown-- but this color is just
gorgeous.The ink is smooth, the caps of the pens fit tight, and the barrel feels good to
hold. I have since bought more of these in other colors and I'll probably just
wind up collecting them all. Definitely pick a few up and see what you think, I
bet you'll love them!"
danslee,"September 12, 2017","A unique set of subtly distinctive colors. To the quick glance they look black,
but a more careful look shows that the colors have a subtle undertone. Great
pens."

Mason,"May 5, 2020","I love these pens, fairly consistent ink flow, conservative pops of color.They really are a joy to use. Every once and a while they do skip.The only downside with these pens are they don't have refills available, you
must purchase the whole pen again. Also, the Bordeaux Black (aka ""Black-Red"")
pen is more pink than black, I didn't care for it.My favorite of the bunch is Green Black, very subtle but noticeable when used in
conjunction with black ink. The Brown Black is also very nice.  "
b_harris06,"January 30, 2020","I bought these upon the recommendation of the Jet Pens online guides. I’m so

delightful. The pens look refillable, requiring cartridges that I hope to
purchase at JetPens. "
athenaxc,"July 21, 2018","Great colors - exactly what I wanted from an off-black set. If only they were
retractable..."
HaPo,"January 25, 2018","Wonderful writing and wonderful colors. I'm so glad they made this a set-- it's
so nice to have a variety of black-tinted colors to choose from for every day
writing. The colors are just vivid enough to be distinct but they don't draw too
much attention and look rather sophisticated. This is also my first time getting
this type of pen, and it writes like a dream. Ink dries fast enough that I don't
have to worry about smudging even with my kind of awkward pen grip."
carrunchio,"November 25, 2017","Deep, rich, elegant hues. "
williamdleader,"September 5, 2017",The colors are exquisite. These are great pens and I highly recommend.

Carollowne,"July 22, 2017","I love all the Signo UM 151 pens  and use the white all the time in my
sketchbooks.  These are great pens and I love their versatility.  The shades of
Off Black are perfect and fun to use."
smckee7743,"July 19, 2017","These wonderful pens are perfect for zentangle and fine point highlighting on
rocks. Yes, rocks. No other pen has given such a smooth and even line, and I've
tried over a dozen brands. Don't be fooled by the uniball pens available in your
local W-mart. Writing that is in Japanese on the pen barrel is what to look for.
I also love these pens for detail work on watercolor cards. "
karunjchandran,"December 25, 2022",great pens. love the fine tip.
kelley.turner,"December 4, 2022","These are fine writing pens with consistent high-quality which are true value. I
love the blue blended colors. They really add distinction and style not commonly
seen."
Scully,"November 24, 2022","Not refillable and the ink takes a while to dry so it's prone to smearing. Not
recommended for left-handed writers."
aimeeryan,"November 15, 2022","Love these colors! Something different from black or blue is a nice change. My
fav is the brown so far. Same amazing uniball signo quality. "
jalmascok,"November 9, 2022","I absolutely LOVE the ink color selection in this set- it is beautiful!! The
point provides a smooth writing experience and is easy to use. The only slight
drawback is the placement of the grip. For me, it’s up a bit too high on the
barrel to be really comfortable, but I hold my pens tightly and near the tip. I
got this package of multiple colors and extras of a few more and have shared a
few with friends, who have told me they really like them, so overall, quite a
success. "
Caroline,"October 18, 2022","I adore this pen in black, and have several around at all times, and these
colors are fabulous as well. I'm using them to make a subtle rainbow on each
page of my 5-year diary, 3 years in and it's looking great. My only gripe is
that sometimes the ink flow will for no apparent reason dry up to a scratchy
line, but a few words on it will go back to normal. I never have this issue with
my black pens, so I can only guess it's something to do with the formulations of
these colors."
Sean M,"October 11, 2022","I think this is my fourth set of off-blacks. Definitely a favourite. Four stars
because about 20% of the pens I get in this series have significant blobbing
issues after even brief periods of use and then setting them down. But a quick
wipe and it's all good. The line width is really key for me, as I have very tiny
writing!"
antoinette.chambers,"July 7, 2022","These write pretty well. But they can have a hard start after sitting for a
while."
Savage1,"June 30, 2022","My absolute favorite go to pen, especially the off black colors."
daryl.boman,"June 20, 2022","Love these pens! The off-black colors are serious but still fun when taking
notes or doing quick sketches. Never smears--which is important for
left-handers. Get some of these pens and a Leuchtturm1917 notebook of your
choice and you won't regret it!"
Renee,"June 20, 2022","Impressive fine line pens, smoooth & wet!  The colors are similar to the vintage
sarasa colors, which I love!  I actually got these as a freebie with my
order....I will definitely buy more if they come out with additional colors like
the yellow ochre in the sarasa set!"
Not Skynet,"June 13, 2022","These are my favorite colorways. Smooth writers even after a couple years of
inconsistent use (I usually use broad/bold nibs)."
tiremisoo,"May 30, 2022","The colors in this bundle are phenomenal. I've always had a soft spot for these
pens because when they work well, the ink flow is gorgeous. That being said, the
main problem I encounter with this model is that the flow is inconsistent, where
the ink either skips or beads at the tip and causes you to have fat drops of ink
when you put your pen down. However, I don't know any other brands that do these
specific colors so well, so I will likely come back to them."
alej,"May 29, 2022","This is my favorite fine point pen. I think most other pens in this range are
too scratchy, but this one is relatively smooth. The colors are vibrant and they
are a pleasure to write with.I just can't rate this five stars because the wonderful Signo-DX refills just
for some reason aren't compatible with retractable pens. I wish they were!"
affi,"May 11, 2022","The colors are beautiful! I love the very fine tip size. They feel nice to write
with, when they write properly. One of them is extremely scratchy, to the point
of barely writing most of the time, and two others sort of leak sometimes,
leaving wet spots that don't ever dry. I've been using them all daily for a
while now, and it hasn't gotten better. Two of them are perfect.If you get ones that work, they're great. If you don't, well..."
Clifton R,"April 30, 2022","I like all of these colors a lot - the ""Green Black"", a deep Forest Green, and
""Bordeaux Black"", a slightly purplish dark red, are two of my favorite colors,
but the dark purple ""Lavender Black"" and dark brown ""Brown Black"" are also good.
Blue-black is a more common color in inks, but this is a good one.The Signo 0.38 mm pens are all excellent pens for general writing, with a
consistent very fine line that's finer than you might think from the 0.38mm
ball, and this is a nice set of colors to have, especially for note-taking and
call-outs in contrasting colors."

vietle0808,"May 8, 2021","I love this set. First it’s the rare set that doesn’t include black, red and
other light colors ( I don’t like light colors). The lavender black is the
smoothest and inkiest. Keep in mind it has more black than violet. Bordeaux
black while pretty is very consistent ( skip teribbly). The green black is the
one I like the most. Overall, I’m very happy with this set"
alasley,"May 7, 2021","These are great little writers in subtle colors. If they came in 0.5mm, I would
buy those immediately as well."
CovingtonLetterCo,"May 5, 2021","I was so excited for this ""off black"" set of pens, but have found that - at
least for me - the .38mm signos don't hold a candle to the .5mm. I wish the full
color spectrum was available in the .5 size but alas, they are not! Still great
pens, just have a harder time with this nib size. "
carolinedocorahon,"May 1, 2021","Nice ink colours for these pens, a little different from standard blue and
black, but still conservative enough to be office friendly. The ink is
waterproof and does not smear, which is a plus."

value, also. "
kgpinc,"March 17, 2021","I am left handed and was very excited to receive these pens because of the views
left by left handed users saying how great they worked. I have an employee who
is right handed and had the very same complaint. I ordered several of each color
and they write fine for a short period of time, then the ink does not flow and
it is hard to maintain speed while writing. You have to go back and rewrite
where the ink did not flow. Very very disappointed. The pen does write somewhat
better on certain grades of paper, but not a lot. "
Pinataplans,"March 12, 2021","These pens would be 5 stars, except they skip regularly. When they actually
work, they are wonderful writing implements, but the ink flow is quite
inconsistent. My preferred line width is .38 - so I'm used to a little scratchiness, and that
would be something I could easily overlook. However, when I tell you that these
pens skip, I mean the ink flow completely ceases (full stop). I have to then
trace circles on a scratch pad to get the ink flowing again.If you take the time to read reviews of this pen, you'll find that many people
mention skipping and inconsistent ink flow - however, they still rate it as 5
stars. Why?!? That makes no sense; those are not hallmarks of a good pen. It
doesn't matter how lovely or unique the ink is if it cannot be deposited
correctly on the page."
ellnz7,"February 15, 2021",Great colors
griffithmartha,"February 9, 2021","I am using these fine point pens for sketching and they are perfect. The black

write beautifully and are great for hobonichi paper!  "
InkToPaper,"January 7, 2021","Very inconsistent flow :( I bought these for the muted colours and their fine
tip and because JetPens rated them so highly (best gel pen 2020). The colours
are okay but the pens are not. Zebra, Pentel and Pilot are all better. The ink
either barely comes out or comes out in big blobs that end up smudged across the
page. I'd upload a pic if I could If you want muted colours, the Zebra Sarasa Clip Vintage colour pens are
infinitely superior. They are 0.5mm but the pens are so much more attractive.
They have better clips, are retractable, the colours are nicer and the ink flow
is as smooth and consistent as it gets. In addition, they are close to half the
price! I really don't know why JetPens rates these so highly. Zebra Sarasa's
thinner nibs (0.4mm/0.3mm) don't come in as many colours but they are still far
superior writing instruments."

colors were really nice but there are a lot of consistency issues with the ink.
The Bordeaux black and green black pen especially skip a lot. Every few words I
write, the ink begins to die off.  The others aren't much better but at least
aren't as inconsistent. I was really hoping these would work out, especially
after reading all the good reviews, but they were overall pretty disappointing. "

rybloc0307,"May 8, 2020","I got this set to test out the color variety and overall quality of the Signo
line. I have been very pleased with the overall performance, and I especially
love the brown color. I have noticed that the brown pen will occasionally dry up
for a moment, but with a twist will write like normal. I can’t speak towards
this problem in regards to the other colors as I have not used them enough.
Overall I think these pens work great for my everyday cary needs, where I use
them in my reminders notebook. Highly recommend!"

missCoco,"December 18, 2019","I love the uni-ball 0.38 pens, and I especially love this color set - though I
would have picked grey over burgundy as the 5th color. I think the burgundy pen
is much more of a ""color"" than the rest of them are. I gave away a couple to my fellow pen nerd in the office, and he was also
thrilled with them! I am used to retractable pens, but the cap snaps in a very
satisfying way, so it feels secure when I am writing and when I replace the cap.
I can also use the cap to fidget with just like a retractable pen"

the perfect size for me to write compact notes, but still legible. This is my
first time trying 0.38 mm pens and I now prefer this size to 0.5 and 0.7mm. The
only downside is that sometimes the pens will appear to have run out, and will
not dispense ink but after letting them rest for a bit and shaking, they work
fine. It does get a little irritating but they have lasted me all year and I
take all of my notes in pen, so definitely worth the investment."
jenniferisabella,"May 21, 2019","I received (and promptly used up) a Uni-ball Signo UM-151 in black from the
left-handed pen sampler. Instead of purchasing 5 black pens, I decided to try

are a fun departure from the typical black or blue pen without being too bright.
Writes clean, dries super fast, and has no noticeable pen noise when writing."

sometimes the ink would not come out and it usually takes some shaking around to
get the ink back or to wait a day or two before using it again. I don't mind it
though, they also dry super fast which is a bonus, yet they do smear with the
pastel set of zebra milliners but not with any dark colors, ex the warm set of
milliners do not smear. Overall, I adore these pens so much and are incredible
to use while taking notes."

DaniyoKT,"September 26, 2018","Out of the entirety of the UM-151 line, all of the off blacks are my favorite
because they represent the perfect balance between writing with black while
sticking to one color that isn't too boring or repetitive to look at. Bordeaux
Black in particular is my favorite choice out of these 5- Lavender Black follows
behind it. Brown Black serves as a finer tip for my 0.7 versions, while the other two,
Blue/Green-Black are spares because I already had them in a previous set I
bought. As these all came together with the other 6 products I ordered in the span of
one week, Kudos to JetPens for fast service and affordable prices."

Rhodia or Tomoe River paper with them, but everyday use doesn't allow for
special paper. However, the colors are vivid and the pens don't skip when they write, which I
am happy with. This is more of a 3.5 than a straight 3 for me. "

kimberli.kelmor,"April 26, 2017","Love these pens, they are just the right nib size for me. And the off black

color is lovely."

David Cesarino,"August 21, 2018","Indeed the previous reviewer was right. The new 02 Preppy is much thicker than
the previous 02 Preppy. It is halfway between old 02 and old 03, but the
appearance resembles the old 03 (fine) even more than the old 02 (extra fine).For those who write thin and small letters, it is unacceptable.This is not the Extra Fine I'm looking for."
adpuchalski,"June 23, 2018","The Preppy is/was my favorite cheap fountain pen. Durable and with a very fine
point nib. Lovely for drawing, even my left-handed friends could get lines out
of it. I recommended it to my students as a good sketch pen. Sadly the redesign
has uneven ink flow and a much thicker point. I guess I'm back to looking for an
inexpensive drawing pen that accommodates the (still excellent) Platinum
cartridges. "
wendy.ball,"July 25, 2018","I like the preppy pens so much I made sure I had one in all the places I write. 
I started with a fine nib because I heard that Japanese pens run fine already. 
It writes really well and I decided go to extra fine.  I have a few of these and
some write better than others.  Ink flow seems to be an issue in some.  It can
be scratch but once familiar with the feel of an extra fine nib I can work well
with it and really like using it where I want the extra fine effect.  "
chrispmoellering,"April 7, 2020","Got one of these as a gift a couple of months ago. For a $5 pen, I have no
complaints. It is the finest point fountain pen I have tried (Pilot Metropolitan
fine, Lamy Safari EF) and I am pleased at the narrowness of the line.Sure, it's essentially a disposable pen at this price point, but it's
increasingly becoming my go to fountain pen just because I really like how fine
it writes. If I could get this nib on my Lamy Safari, I'd have my perfect EDC
pen, but alas.... "
Kris,"August 24, 2018","The pen I received was unusable. The nib is scratchy and writes unevenly. I
loved the old Preppy."
Nyih,"July 12, 2022","This is my favorite pen of all time. I have tried Pilot Penmenship EF and it is as fine as this but it's also very
scratchy. Preppy 0.2 is a lot smoother to write with. I don't think there is
another pen out there writing as fine as this as smooth as this does. The
plastic is also very resistant. In these past 3 years (the 1st time I got a
Preppy) I have dropped it so many times!! It's full of tiny scratches all over
but not a single crack. The label is gone too but I don't mind it. That's why I got myself 4 more Preppy 0.2 pens. It's also the perfect line
thickness for me who used to only write with 0.3 gel pens. "
Rotsterne,"March 6, 2022","Original review (September 24, 2021: I got this pen today, and filled it with
Noodler's X-Feather Black Ink. I don't know if it needs to ""broken in"" a bit or
what, but it has really inconsistent ink flow. I tried separating the tines a
bit, and that didn't do anything. I'm very disappointed. When it writes, it's
smooth, but... inconsistent ink flow is a big problem. I'm quite frustrated with
this pen. I have two Platinum Preppy 03s and they don't have this problem.Edit: The pen was not the problem. The ink was. I have since tried many inks in
my extra fine Platinum Preppy pens, and have never had any problems with ink
flow. No more Noodler's ink for me. These are great pens!"
Clairem,"February 23, 2021","The best way to describe this pen is ""extremely mediocre"" It writes fine,
handles nicely, doesn't catch on paper, and isn't weighted badly. However, it's
extremely light and makes my hand cramp terribly (then again I have hand
problems). My truest gripe with this pen is something wholly different. WHY IT
DRY THE MOMENT I STOP WRITING? At first I thought there was something wrong with
my ink, but the moment I stop writing the tip gets dry and you basically have to
write an invisible essay to get the ink flowing again. Not ideal when you're
trying to take notes in class."
adubard24,"October 17, 2019","While I love the pen, I expected the extra-fine nib to be much thinner. On the
good side, it is not scratchy and performs quite well for such a low price.. if
you're looking for a true extra-fine nib.. I'd pass on this one"
birdman,"November 11, 2022","A wonderful pen for beginners. The cap is excellent. After finishing college, I
put the pen away somewhere without cleaning it out first (my mistake), and upon
finding it, I could still write well. "
dg747267,"September 2, 2021","I very much liked the design and feel of the Platinum Preppy but sorry to say
that it turnedout to be to finicky, once I got the pen to write it was perfect, fine dark med.
wet line, but when I capped the pen for 10 to 30 min. and tried to use it again it would not
write untilI went thru a series of nib wipes and test runs on scratch paper, then when it
started towrite it was perfect. After many attempts I gave up, cleaned it and threw it in
a drawer.A disappointing waste of money and time. Zero Stars! "
megook,"February 9, 2020","Worked great until the pen body cracked around the joint where it screws in!  I dont remember dropping it as I had stored it alongside other pens in a bag.  Im disappointed in that.  I'd ordered the fine as well.  There is a marked
difference in size between the EF and F.  I am unfamiliar with the previous
model so I couldn't tell of any changes in nib behavior.  It flowed well with all my inks, waterproof, waterbased.  "
susie,"December 28, 2022","This is such a great starter pen. Affordable, portable, not too precious - but
really shows you what a fountain pen is capable of! I've gifted many to friends."

datholen,"November 28, 2022",So far this is becoming one of my favorite pens.
siddiqueeraiha,"November 24, 2022","A classic for a reason. Cheap and smooth and cute, what's not to love? "
t.reiser,"November 7, 2022","This was my very first fountain pen. Great value. Even if you think you want a
fountain pen that's comparable to a gel or roller ball, I would encourage you to
get the 03 nib size. The slightly larger nib allows ink to flow a little easier
and doesn't snag on cheap or thin paper quite as much."
ardrhi,"September 20, 2022","Excellent beginner's fountain pen. When first starting with fountain pens, just
use cartridges. They're easy to install and have a goodly amount of ink in them.
I use the Carbon Black ink cartridges in my Preppy and Prefounte pens, for
simplicity's sake. But I do have a bottle of the Carbon Black for inking other
pens. These pens are very good writers. You will have to learn how to properly hold
and write with a fountain pen, though. It's not the no-brainer a ballpoint biro
is. But the Platinum pens under $20 are inexpensive, but NOT ""cheap"". They're
very forgiving to write with and help you learn all the bits and pieces of a
fountain pen and how to care for one, without the worry that you're going to
ruin a $50 -- or $500!! -- pen just trying to learn how to write with it
properly. A $5 or $10 pen is perfectly good to start with.To be utterly blunt honest about it, if you know nothing about fountain pens,
try a pack of Thornton's disposable fountain pens. You don't have to worry about
them at all, as they're even less expensive than a Preppy at around $2. You
don't have to worry about how to clean it, how to take it apart, how to refill
it, because a disposable is just that. Use up the ink and throw it out. They
come in packs of 12, so if you manage to ruin one learning to write with it,
throw it out and take another out of the package. By the time you're done with
those, you can move on to a Platinum Preppy with confidence, and learn all about
taking a pen apart to clean it and how to change the ink cartridge. If you're
feeling really secure, you can get a converter for your Preppy, or some O-rings
and silicone grease, and turn it into an eyedropper-fill pen with a truly
impressive ink supply in the barrel. LOTS to learn from, with nearly no real
dollar investment, but it's still a decent pen that writes very, very well.I hadn't done enough longhand writing to properly remember until I got this
Platinum Preppy just to stick a toe in the water. I now have around 8 or 10
decent pens, a partial pack of Thornton's in black, and a box of lovely
disposable pens with fine nibs and an array of colors. (8 colors including
black, repeated to give 48 total pens, for about $25. Lovely for playing around
with colored ink, but that's a different show.) I have a journal that's almost
full, with two spares ready to continue with. I bought a box of 10 less
expensive notebooks to write stories in with the Thorntons, just so I have
something more to write in. I find myself writing a LOT, several times a day,
just to enjoy the feel of the fountain pen in my hand.That's what this Preppy did for me. It got me to love writing longhand enough to
look for excuses to do more longhand writing. I don't think there's anything
better one can say about an entry-level fountain pen than ""it made me love
writing longhand"".You'll graduate to more expensive and better pens with time. That's ok. But the
foundation for that enjoyment can come from one of the least expensive fountain
pens available. I bought two Preppy's, one in EF and one in F. Then a Prefounte
in F that I bought for the beautiful emerald color of the barrel.Buy one and try it."
bujo.doctor,"June 1, 2022","I got this pen to swap nibs with my platinum plaisir which has a Fine nib. I
thought that as a Japanese pen the extra fine would be the equivalent to the
pilot kakuno EF but it writes more like a F and the F writes like a medium. "

bailey.armour,"May 11, 2020","Within a week of owning this pen the plastic body cracked where the thread

things together but it was disappointing. Otherwise the pen is a good
introduction to fountain pens. "

Meow,"July 3, 2019","My extra fine Preppy writes considerably smoother than my 'fine' Kaweco. Go
figure! These are just wonderful writing pens and super reliable. Consistent
flow, doesn't skip. I even use the poor thing on watercolor paper for details
(using no pressure, just glide) it doesn't complain. Of 10 fountain pens, the
fine Preppy is the only one more enjoyable to write with. Try a Preppy first,
yum!  "
Brian,"November 28, 2018","I love the Platinum Preppy fountain pens. After buying a blue-black model with a
03 nib, I bought this EF nib model and a converter. I immediate filled it with
Higgins Fountain Pen ink and love writing and drawing with it. The point of the
nib is smooth and it lays down a juicy line-- beware smudging!! But otherwise
the Preppy pens are a FANTASTIC value. Get them to write with, draw with, as an every day pen, whatever!"

rosenmax,"April 26, 2022","These are my everyday pens.  I have to write a lot of notes on small cards for

time--ultimately not snapping on at all and falling off when quickly removing
the pen from a pocket.  I've lengthened the cap/snap life by not using the tail
of the pen to hold the cap while in use."

Rotsterne,"February 2, 2022","These are great pens! I had trouble with ink flow until I figured out that some
inks are too thick for extra fine nibs like these. They prefer thinner/wetter
inks like Pilot, J Herbin, and Diamine. This is a pretty smooth pen for being
Extra Fine, certainly smoother than others I've tried. The line they produce is
just a little bit wider than that produced by, say, a Pilot extra fine nib, but
I still find it acceptable for my small handwriting. "

So awesome for the price!"
laura,"November 9, 2018","This inexpensive little pen suits my needs perfectly! It is light weight, can
hold a ton of ink eye droppered and is buttery smooth. If I lose it, I am not
out a lot of money. I am thinking of purchasing another one so I can carry a
different color of ink with me.The line width is not extra fine, but perfect for
writing in the small squares of popular Japanese paper. Too bad the other barrel
colors do not come in this nib size."
ginarteau,"October 31, 2018",Love this so much I bought this one for a friend. The 02 point is spidery fine. 
kharrisma,"October 5, 2018","I love this thing!  It's a no-nonsense, go-to fountain pen that lays down a nice
line of ink with minimal pressure... not too wet, not too dry.  I like to use it
to introduce ball-point people to the world of fountain pens (it's built like a
tank; the excess pressure that people who aren't used to fountain pens tend to
use won't hurt this thing a bit.)  My only negative comment is that it's not as
convenient as a click-type pen, but that's pretty much a necessary evil with all
but the most expensive (modern) fountain pens.  I prefer the push-on type cap to
the screw-on, so that's a plus, too.  Just a good, all-round fountain pen.  The
.02 mm tip does indeed make a fine line (probably somewhere between fine and
extra-fine, but that's a personal judgement call, as there are no hard-and-fast
rules about what constitutes an extra-fine line vs a fine vs a medium, etc.) 
It's plenty fine, anyway... never been a big fan of the broader tips, although
the broad ones do a better job of showcasing the color of the ink being used
than the finer tips do.  I write pretty tiny, so a broader tip tends to fill in
the counter space of many letters, like a and e and o and p, etc, so I prefer
the fine tips.  You won't be unhappy with this pen!"
kevhgil,"October 1, 2018","These are good ""disposable"" fountain pens and they work very nicely. Let's
encourage them to make more colors available."
kayhenderson12,"April 23, 2012","PROS1) The grip. It's ever-so-slightly firmer than a standard alpha gel. On a 1-10
scale of softness:  Standard 207= 1-2Standard Alpha grip= 10Dr. Grip = 3-4207 premier= 9.5 2) The ink: 207 gel. Smooth, permanent, inexpensive. Though they have been known
to be a bit inconsistent, I have gone through five refills thus far and only one
didn't lay down as smooth of a line as the rest, but was still vastly superior
to any other pen I own. 3) The price. It's a jetstream's cost less expensive than standard ballpoint
alphas that don't write nearly as well as this. Although those can take 207
refills, why pay extra? I don't know why this grip doesn't have its own
marketing scheme, because it's really squishy and just a bit more ""gelly"" (it
retains its shape a bit longer after letting go, just to give an idea) than the
alpha mech pencil I have, but I suppose its privacy is to the benefit of those
who venture a bit. CONS1) The clicker on top wiggles a bit when the ink is extended. It's maybe half a
millimeter too narrow for the barrel. Not a big deal, but it does make a little
noise when writing quickly. Conclusion: It's superb for people with too-tight grips, and the ink flows
smoothly, dries pretty quickly for gel, and is archival quality (pH neutral,
water resistant, acid-free, unwashable, etc...) at a low price. Even the
refills, for the quality of the ink, are almost suspiciously inexpensive ($2 for
a 2 pack). Buy it."
shanehenrycpa,"March 10, 2012","Exceptionally comfortable pen.  Originally purchased for the anti-fraud
features, intending to use it to sign all checks at my business.  But it is so
comfortable and writes so well I basically use if for everything.  Wish they had
a couple different colors of the pen - you can fill with different color refills
but it would be nice to be able to tell the difference by the outside of the pen
itself. The only bad thing about this pen is that it is so comfortable you have to pay
close attention or else it will disappear!"
Yoyochanny,"April 23, 2013","A new favorite!  I love how the Signo 207s write, but I never cared for the
""nubby"" grip on the standard models.  The super-squishy gel grip on this pen is
a pleasure to hold, though a matte finish like the alpha gel pens and pencils
would have been better for repelling dust that tends to accumulate on the grip. 
 The body itself is just like the standard model with a few minor aesthetic
tweaks.  The pen is pretty well-balanced, though just slightly front-heavy
because of the grip. The tip glides well and doesn't skip, and I personally like the Signo 207
refills better than Pilot G2s in terms of ink viscosity.  Signo 207 ink is
quick-drying, saturated and extremely smooth.  The color is slightly grey when
put side-by-side with G2 ink, which has more blue tones in it.  The refills are
also budget-friendly which I like. I hope they come out with some other colors for this model, because I wouldn't
mind adding a few more to my collection!"
Sharpshooter,"April 27, 2014","For one with arthritis and large hands, this is my #1 pen for any kind of
writing. Even better, the Uniball UMR-83 and 85 fit this exactly like the original. I

non-standard refills work just fine. "
testa101,"August 8, 2012","Hey guys, i know you guys are all excited about Signo ink, but i have news.
Jetstream refills fit this. So do what you will with this information. Just on the side, completely
irrelated, a jestream pen with alpha gel is more. Just in case you want a very
smooth writing comfortable pen. The cheap comfort of this pen and its refillableness warrant the five star
rating I'm giving it. I will make no comments about its horrible inconsistent
skippy atrocious ink. "
anacarmona505,"April 28, 2019","The grip is really squishy and comfortable to write with! The ink isn't too
great but that can be easily fixed by inserting an Energel Refill ;).My main issue with this pen, and why I gave it 3 stars, is that the grip starts
way too high for me. I have to position my hand awkwardly in order to hold it."
Abe White,"December 18, 2019","Ink:  I don’t use the ink that comes with this pen, but I tested it, and it is
very smooth and vibrant.  Body:  I don’t really like this body.  The grip is a little too squishy, which
makes me grip it even tighter, which makes the whole point of the ergonomic grip
somewhat pointless.  Also, Pentel Energel refills fit in here, but they are
somewhat shorter in this pen than in a standard EnerGel body.  This makes is a
little harder to write with.  Overall, not so great pen, but still good."
Wafflebob,"January 7, 2018","Pros. 1. Grip is squishy and comfortable allowing it to be held comfortably in
different ways and write for longer periods of time without fatigue.2. Seems pretty sturdily built. 3. Despite some other complaints I've seen, it seems to lay down ink pretty
well. Cons.1. Pen is a bit large for my taste. 2. I prefer finer lines on my pens and this seems to only be available in .7"
Cmd42,"February 27, 2017","Personaly prefer the regular signo pens... the ultra-squishy grip is a bit alien

huginacup,"June 9, 2015","I love this pen! I'm currently studying for major state-regulated exams right
now, but I'm also on these meds that causes all my joints to hurt (and quite
often dislocate). Writing with my normal hard pens (and even typing at times)
makes my fingers hurt horribly and sometimes causes the second knuckle of my
middle and pointer fingers to randomly begin to dislocate (IT'S LITERALLY A
NIGHTMARE FOR ME RIGHT NOW).I ordered this pen literally 2 weeks prior to having to take the unexpected
medication, and this pen has turned out to be an amazing blessing I did not
expect.I can actually study and take notes with my fingers and wrists hurting for a
couple hours at a time!!!! Good thing I ordered two. I have one filled with
black ink and the other with blue ink. The squishiness of the grip + the smooth
signo ink = a true godsend for someone like me."

kaitythebear,"July 1, 2021","A while ago I got the uni alpha gel kuru toga mechanical pencil and it's my
favorite pencil ever. I've been looking for forever for a gel pen body that's
equally as good but the uni alpha gel ball point pen doesn't hold pentel energel

don't know how they do it but it's equally as squishy and still somehow easier
to control. Just buy it now. "
tjgnew,"May 19, 2021","The grip is super squishy and the ink is great! I only wish the tip was not so

Kitty,"December 28, 2020","The other Jetstream Alphagel pen. Grip is strikingly similar, despite it not

myhyn17,"March 30, 2020","if you’re bothered by lower case letters, i’m sorry. but here comes my
review!! i’ve debates a lot on whether or not to get this, pen, and honestly
it’s an amazing pen. it’s inky, dark, and smooth. the squishy tip allows my
hands to relax. i write with a hard grip and occasionally get hand cramps and my
hands hurt because of pressure i apply on my utensil. if you apply hard pressure
like me, this is a good pen for you! as a student, i’m always obligated to
write all the time — whether it be taking notes or finishing assignments.
using a pen like this helps make my life easier, my hand hurts less than before
with the other pens i used that had a plastic body and rubber tip. the only
reason i have this pen a 4/5 is because one, there’s no 4.5 option. the other
is the pen it self. i’ve always come across a time where i hand to constantly
fix the pen, the pen always gets loose, so i have to twist it back into
position. although it can be annoying, it’s nothing that is life threatening.
it’s something i have to live with and i’m fine with doing so :) "
llimsch28,"March 17, 2020","This pen is underwhelming at this price...the barrel is all plastic and there's

elise12192,"September 3, 2019","I loved this pen when I first got it. I used it almost exclusively for 5 months.
However, as I continued to use it, several problems showed up:1. I tried a lot of different inserts, which probably caused this problem, but
the body started to get loose at the seam. I'd have to twist it back together
throughout the day.2. The gel grip, which is incredibly comfortable, got a hole in it after 5
months. This may be due to my thumbnail pressing into the gel when I write. This pen feels amazing, but it really doesn't last. After 5 months, I had to
replace it. I'll be looking for a sturdier ergonomic option in the future."

lines will turn into big white gaps and  unless you put it away for about a day

good or bad depending on what you want. I don't like how the grip is SUPER
squishy- Takes many refills. It works with the Pentel Energel LRN5Cons:- Aesthetics: looks kind of boring- The metal nose cone section is long, which puts the grip very high. If you

school. I had some very good ones, too, but unfortunately they weren't the ones
who taught us how to write. As a result of my ""right-lateral tripod death grip,""
my handwriting has always been marginal and after a very short time the pressure
of the pen against my knuckle becomes painful and distracting (and yes, it's
gotten worse as I've gotten older). I've tried the Dr. Grip, and found it ... unhelpful. I love fountain pens, but
most (even my sweet Lamy 2000) just aren't comfortable for more than a few
minutes. As many have commented, the ink that comes with the Signo 207 is only adequate
(but EnerGel refills fit just fine -- I'd be in heaven if Zebra Surari refills
fit, but they're not even close). This pen is a godsend. I can write without pain. Thank you, JetPens! I would

majority of my job. But there are times that I must be in the field or working
some manual labor from time to time. If my hands are the least bit greasy or
dirty - the grip is instantly nasty which is something that I can't stand. Plus,
I think the grip is a little too soft for my pleasure. Proof that this pen is not for everyone."

nib size is just right. TWSBI's F nib size is finer than Lamy's F and broader
than Pilot's F which ends up being just right for me to show off a little bit of
sheen on the right papers without being so wet that my letters drag together.The pen itself feels good in my hand and has a good weight to it (about 22.8g
with ink, compare with 26.5g for a Pilot Metropolitan with ink and cartridge or
15.8g for a Lamy Safari with ink and cartridge). It is smooth and solid.I highly recommend this pen. It makes for a great intermediate level pen at a

weight feels lopsided but that hasn't bothered me. "
scoots,"July 29, 2022","I bought this along with an ECO to see which grip I preferred (so far, not
noticed much difference). The nib writes much thicker than I expected, maybe
thicker than a 0.7mm pen, which I would not call a fine; I don't mind, as the
other TWSBI I ordered is finer and this one shows off some lovely unexpected
shading in the first ink I tried, but be aware there may be some variation in
nib sizing from the manufacturer. That being said, I love this pen—the mint
blue trim is lovely, I love looking at the ink inside, and the pen itself is a
lot of fun to use, lightweight and comfortable and writes well. I do find that
the cap wobbles a little distractingly when posted, but that's easy to fix by
just not posting it."

great fountain pen."
firsa,"July 26, 2022","I'm new to fountain pens; I got this one and a Pilot Metropolitan. What I like

nice nib. What I don't like: The screw cap. I'd prefer to have a cap that you
can pop on and off. What I'm unsure of: It's very lightweight compared to the
Metro, being plastic, but that's not necessarily a bad thing?I'm glad I got the extra fine nib, as I decided to primarily use this with a
Noodler's ink that feathers just a smidge.This is a great pen at this price point for sure, and clearly a great pen for
someone who's getting started with fountain pens!"

midoricowart,"June 13, 2022","I like this pen because it can hold lots of ink. But, the fine nib, which I
bought, is more like a medium nib to me."
prussianbluelife,"April 22, 2022","This is only my third TWSBI ECO.  I have an EF and a STUB Eco in Smoke Rose
Gold, both of which write beautifully (a bit on the juicy side).  This pen <F>,
however, consistently hard starts and has drier ink flow, even though I have the
same ink, Noodler's Black, in all three pens.  The lines created by this <F> nib
is actually thinner and lighter than written with my TWSBI ECO <EF>.  When I
first inked-up the pen and started to use it, it burped a splot of ink onto the
paper.  Later, when I waved off a bug in the air using my dominant hand, the pen
dripped several droplets of ink onto the paper.  I am very disappointed by the
nib quality. My other two TWSBI ECO nibs never hard starts likes this nib does. 
My other complaint is the depiction of the color on the JET PENS website.  The
pen does not look as vibrant or saturated in-person as in the photos. In real
life, the pen color like a pale, baby blue.  "
aprout1988,"April 15, 2022","Easy to use, writes very smooth, feels great in hand. Would recommend. "
csreitmann,"March 4, 2022",I love this pen. Easy to fill. No mess. Writes beautifully.
sarahbethasher,"January 28, 2022","I'm not an expert in fountain pens and ink, but I love this pen so far!"
pjmcguin,"January 3, 2022","A little over a week with this pen with daily use. I enjoy the size; the grip
could use a little texture but it’s not a bother. It write smooth and an able
to dig in with it getting scratchy! Doesn’t dry out—can’t ask for more,
really. Love it! Definitely gonna order a different color as a backup. "
matthewwinterstein,"August 12, 2021",Works great and arrived quickly.Another fantastic product from my favorite online store!
cochranvic,"June 10, 2021",Love the pen. Filling is messy but that's my fault 
moonlitsorciere,"May 30, 2021","Very cute color! Writes a little thicker than I was expecting but overall still
a wonderful pen!! (I may just be using ink that's too ""wet"" for it)"
mcegomez06,"May 12, 2021","Great pen, love TWISBY! Need all of them! "
Libby Mae Brown,"April 1, 2021","My favorite pen, even though it's 1/3 the cost of some others I have in my
collection. "
fiareflies,"February 8, 2021","Instantly became one of my favorite pens I use on the daily. Filling with ink is
simple and easy, and it writes very smoothly, rarely skipping."
PantherLion,"January 27, 2021","I love the colour and the writing is smooth with no snags or burps from the nib.
The fill system works smoothly and is easy to use. I read some reviews on
whether or not to clean it before filling, and most said it was alright to fill
and write as is, and that's exactly what I did, and it works really well. I love
the grip as it makes the pen feel secure in my fingers as I write, but also to
help me hold the pen correctly, as I'm terrible at holding fountain pens at the
right angle. I am so happy with this pen that I'm super excited to get another!
Would definitely recommend as it's super affordable, fills & writes well, and is
comfortable to hold."
weaver,"November 12, 2020","I just wrote another review of the ECO-T -- the grip is a great improvement for
me over the round barrel.  Not as great as the Lamy grip, but enough to make
this pen a lot more enjoyable for me to use than the regular Eco pens.  And this
mint green color is absolutely gorgeous. "
cunjun8,"November 2, 2020","very beautiful product, only complaint is that it is a tad too big, make it
harder to grip, and heavy. But this might be a personal preference. My hands are
not on the big side. About the tip, the fine nib writes a bit thicker than
pilot's fine nib, very small differenceIf TWSBI has a thinner version of ECO fountain pen, I would still love to buy
one, one of my favourite fountain pen design so far."
meanerina,"October 26, 2020",Love it!
Nguyen99a,"September 29, 2020","I'm in love with this pen and its color. It's my second fountain pen and I use
it with my yu-yake ink and it writes beautifully. Super simplistic yet aesthetic
looking pen. Well made and sturdy too!"
horsesinparadise,"September 5, 2020","I am in love with this pen! When I write with it, it doesn’t make the
downstrokes any thicker, it just looks normal. I don’t know if it’s supposed
to be like that, but I love it anyway and will never buy any ballpoint pen
again! :D it also glides across the paper amazingly! "
3Pnaga,"June 29, 2020","I’ve been debating whether I should get this pen for months and now I’m so
glad I did.  She looks even better in person, makes you happy color.  You
can’t go wrong with a TWSBI."
penny.graf,"May 12, 2020","The writing is very smooth, especially on good paper, and the larger ink supply
means I can write much longer without having to refill the pen. I have read
about the TWSBI pens for years but worried that they would be heavy to hold.
Instead, this pen is just right."
cgrammer,"April 17, 2020","My first TWSBI and I love it. The fine a little thicker than I'm use to with
other brands, but it isn't a big difference."
rs13011819,"April 6, 2020",Writes smoothly and beautifully.
dgirl,"March 9, 2020","Nice color, and the nib is way finer than expected, which I like. It's really
smooth, and I think its my favorite fountain pen. "
rachelloveshorses,"March 17, 2020","I found these highlighters a few years ago on amazon and loved them, but could
never find the full pack of 25. When I discovered the Jetpens YouTube channel, I
noticed they made a video on highlighters and decided to take a look at the
website. I was so excited to find the full set I had been looking for for years!
The highlighters came early and in perfect condition. I use them for school,
studying, and bullet journaling and they work perfectly. I'd definitely
recommend these to anyone looking for a unique set of mildliners. "
dovepottery,"February 10, 2020","I love the color array, but I was disappointed with how they bleed. I
specifically chose these pens because they were not supposed to bleed, but they
do. Probably not on a card stock or thick paper, but on printer style paper,
beware that they will bleed. I still gave them 4 stars because a) the colors are lovely and b) though they do
bleed, it doesn’t make the other side of the paper totally illegible. "
Sakku,"July 8, 2019","my second set! using my first set fast! and great gifts to give to friends who
love stationary the colours are beautiful and not harsh on the eyes."
emma.lanley,"June 10, 2019",Fantastic. Absolutely love these liners!
artistlyz,"July 26, 2020","Absolutely love these! Even with the darker colors what one writes shows through
perfectly, I did notice that with pen tips of .7mm and up you have to wait a
little (like 5-7 seconds really) before using them to avoid smearing that is
minimal nonetheless, but with .5mm you can use them immediately (I use zebra
sarasa, energels, and pilot multiball pens)Best highlighters I've ever used!"
mnolasco.808,"March 29, 2020","Would be better if they came in some sort of case or container, but the
highlighters are great."
plumdots,"March 25, 2020","The Mildliners are in amazing condition, however, they don't come in a package
:( They were bound with a rubber band when I ordered them, but that's not a
problem, unless you want official packaging, which I was kinda hoping for :)"
greyautumnsky,"March 9, 2020","I purchased these after seeing several reviews online for them in various bullet
journaling forums. They are very pretty, and easy on the eyes.I do not have long term experience with them, so take my review with a grain of
salt. However, in the less than a month I've had them I have been pleased with
the color selection and performance.The fine cap will sometimes come off if you post the chisel tip cap on it. Keep
that in mind if you use several pens at a time."
Energygal25,"January 10, 2020","Wow, just wow! Soft colored and no bleeding, these highlighters are perfect for
highlighting main points or drawing and filling in your planner!"
flambiase,"December 20, 2019","Some of the colors are a little too dark to really be used as highlighters, but
overall I'm very happy with this set - great color selection, and the dual tips
are handy for detailed work. I use them as markers to do anatomy drawings for
school, and they're great for that purpose. Also good for calendar / planner
color coding."
YoungKristina57,"December 5, 2019","Love them!!! Use them all the time for word search puzzles, etc.  They last a
long time and are perfect for my needs."
tiffanyliu9392,"November 4, 2019","I like bulking up on mildliners. I am not a fan of the neon ones. However, it's
nice to just get the bunch. It comes in a plastic bag, so consider getting a
pencil pouch for these."
clandestineagentp,"October 24, 2019","Great set of highlighters. The color selection is fantastic and the fact that
they're double sided is really useful. I know they're highlighters but I often
use them for coloring sketches in my sketchbook. They're kind of my substitute
for when I don't want to use up my alcohol markers on doodles."
hadendc21,"October 8, 2019","Love them!! My old mild liners ,from last school years, were getting dull and
worn down. So these are a great new purchase. Highly  recommend! And those new
colors are amazing!"
froehsam23,"May 10, 2019",Amazing quality and beautiful colors! Favorite pens right here.
ilankafw,"September 6, 2022","Set seems good.  Expected it to be in a pack with slots for each, but I
purchased a special pen case for them and it works out well. Colors are good and
rich, and will work well for their intended purpose (in my case, highlighting
and some coloring)."
karenleeatkin,"June 23, 2022","I had thought the chisel tip would be more like a ""calligraphy pen"" tip, and was
looking forward to having this many colors to practice my calligraphy with. 
However, the chisel tip is slanted like a highlighter, which - of course - this
is.  The range of colors is nice, though."

studypeonies,"August 9, 2021","Awesome! Some colours are SO rare, like brown, and vermillion. The bullet tip is
bad. Wears down after 1 and a half uses. Becomes practically a dot marker. Be
sure to use a good pen wth this, since it smears almost every gel pen, but the

krwilkins125,"February 2, 2021","I love these highlighters for my fairly basic bullet journal. Yes, they do make
my gel ink bleed a little, but not in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.  I

highlighters. "
Susan4210,"October 10, 2020",Loving these
smaguilera7,"August 4, 2020","I absolutely love these highlighters. Having a bold and fine side makes these

ekurtz,"December 27, 2019","The pens themselves are fine, but I'm extremely disappointed in the way they
were packaged and shipped. I ordered the set directly from the website but when
they came in the mail, the pens were simply thrown into a mailing envelope.  No
sleeve, no decent presentation.  They were a gift from my daughter and if she
hadn't been so specific about what she wanted, I would have returned them on
principle.  They are simply too expensive for highlighting pens to not include a
sleeve at bare minimum.  "

Jenn,"April 1, 2020","So I bought this whole set from JetPens, right? And then I went to a Japanese
stationary store and saw them in a beautiful rack and got all excited because
they were double-sided. Thinking the set is bought from JetPens was an old
version, I bought another set...and then discovered I was experiencing mild
symptoms of turning 40 this year (aka, memory loss).*facepalm*Oh, but, yeah, Zebra Highlighters are THE BEST. Once you try them, YOU CAN NEVER
GO BACK."
marisoto01,"August 19, 2019",The highlighters were very dry
red251410,"October 16, 2014","The Pilot Elite 95S is a beautifully-made writing instrument with excellent fit
and finish.  It is very light weight, and it handles nicely when posted.  Of
course, posting the cap, for most writers, is an important part of the pen's
design, but it could certainly function nicely un-posted, for someone with small
hands.Please note that the Japanese packaged version offered by Jet Pens does not
include a converter.  I believe the version specifically marketed for the
USA--sold elsewhere--does include a CON-20 converter.  I tried to install a
CON-50 converter, but it did not fit the Elite.  It seems that only a CON-20
aerometric converter will work in this model and it must be pushed in firmly, in
order to secure it.The Elite's fine 14K gold nib produces a moderately wet, crisp line, but it is
not as fine as the fine point nib of my Pilot Capless or Vanishing Point
pens--or even the fine nib of a Pilot 78G.  One may have to choose the
extra-fine nib for the Elite to obtain an extremely fine line.I really like the Pilot Elite 95S and highly recommend it."
eatpomegranate,"July 31, 2018","I have been writing with the Namiki vanishing point for a while but this is a
perfect compliment to my pen case. I love how light this pen is and especially
love the flow of the fine nib. I would highly recommend it. "
gabimandl,"July 13, 2020","really great lab markers, but not as ethanol resistant as some people say...and
definitely not resistant to hexanes! but I love it for labelling tubes
anyway..the labels are a nice dark black, not like transparent grey sharpie
markings. "
kaneme,"July 1, 2019",These are simply the best laboratory pens out there. 
jenneer080597,"April 1, 2015","This pen/marker lives up to it's name of being able to write on just about any
surface. Comparable to a Sharpie, i found that it wrote smoother and was easier
to make fine lines thanks to the extra fine tip. I love this pen and would
highly recommend it. "
Cath,"September 21, 2021","I gave it to my boyfriend to test on lab tubes, and he said that it's

try it out for myself!"
wes,"January 27, 2021",Dark vivid marking on polypropylene sample vials. Good alcohol resistance
labrat,"September 2, 2021","Ethanol resistant, not completely immune to it. On rougher surfaces it holds
really well. Smooth surfaces like petri dish or eppendorf tube side, not so
well.After the ink has dried properly, it's difficult to get it ""accidentally"" wiped
out. You might smear gloves on the ink if working with a lot of ethanol.I think it's one of the better ones if not the best lab markers I've used in a
decade."
Kathleen,"October 22, 2020","Bought it on a recommendation that it is good for laboratory use. It
unfortunately cannot write on slightly wet tubes, the ink just doesn't stick,
which sucks if you forget to label your things right away! Otherwise, the extra
fine tip is perfect for writing on really tiny microcentrifuge tubes, glassware,
tapes, and other plastics (as long as they are dry). It also does not survive liquid autoclaving that well... "

Lillian,"May 2, 2022","Very nice. Not too smelly, both sides have nice fine points. An unexpected bonus
is that both caps stack on the other side. I have not tested these on washed
clothes yet, but it does seem fairly waterproof on plastic."
aorvedahl,"March 3, 2022","These are good fine point pens. We purchased with the report that they were

Perfect as advertised."
lauraann.schmidberger,"September 23, 2021","I expected these markers to be entirely ethanol-resistant but they were not,
they bled a little bit after being sprayed with EtOH (I work in a lab). However
the label was definitely still readable, and I love the two sizes of tips. I
would purchase this again. "
pferko8,"March 31, 2021","I bought this looking to replace sharpies for labeling glassware in the
laboratory. I like the fine tip and thick, crisp lines it draws.  The only
drawbacks are zero solvent resistance to most things other than water, and even
a tiny amount of oil from your hand on glass will cause the ink to bead up and
be difficult to read."

camillebreckenridge,"November 17, 2015",This is a great pen! I use the FINE tip for a lot of my journaling.
Amber M,"July 17, 2017","I love these pens. They are perfect for writing in my appointment calendar where
the space is small. There is a very wide range of colors and I'm able to label
as needed with different colors. I use the wine the most since that one is my
favorite color. These pens do not come in a Pilot packaging. It looks like they
are individual pens that are bundled together in a set for convenience. Since
there is not packaging with the names of the colors, if you would like to know
what color you would like to buy refills for, on the pen's casing there is the
item number. Below are the numbers for the pens I have on hand. I don't use all
the colors and only buy refills for the ones listed below. Hope these will help
anyone that would like to know how to check which color pens they are using and
which refills they need to buy.  ITEM NUMBERS:Wine Rose: LFBS-18UF-WRRose: LFBS-18UF-RS (Refill Item #LFBTRF12UFRS)Purple: LFBS-18UF-PUViolet: LFBS-18UF-V (Refill Item #LFBTRF12UF-V)Red: LFBS-18UF-RGreen: LFBS-18UF-GLight Blue: LFBS-18UF-LBSky Blue: LFBS-18UF-SKLBlue: LFBS-18UF-LBlack: LFBS-18UF-B  A few things that I've experienced: - I write almost exclusively with the Wine Rose. With continued daily use, 5
days a week, I use 1 to 1 1/2 refills a month. I bulk order the refills so that
I always have them on hand. - If you erase too many times over same spot then try to write over it, the pen
will write choppy or not at all. I'm not sure if it is because the paper is now
course and it makes it difficult for the nib or not. But I'll switch to my 0.7
version and it will write over it better. - If it stops writing and there is still ink in the tube, it could be that the
ink got to warm. Put it in the freezer, in a vessel that will allow for it to
stay straight up and it will write again once the ink is cold again. - If you can buy an eraser, do so. The one on the pens will wear with continued
use. Again, the eraser on my Wine Rose pen is starting to point from the wear. I
found an eraser and have started to use that. Otherwise, you'll need to buy a
new pen after a while instead of just refills. - These pens will not write well on anything that isn't matte or textured
papers. I have a hard time with them on the sticky tabs or anything that isn't
like paper. If they do write, its really light, really thin and will smear. I hope this helps anyone interested in these pens. They are really great and I
highly recommend them to anyone that needs a slim profile case and a ultra fine
nib. They are worth the price and are some of the best erasable pens I've used."
bratt59,"March 16, 2017","I use these pens to transfer patterns onto my surfaces.  They work great & then

Almost right,"July 26, 2017","These are my favorite erasable pens.  Thin enough to tuck away inside a check
book or journal but comfortable in the hand to make writing a job.  Love the
colors.  The ink lasts a surprisingly long time and writes smoothly.  Priced
well too. "
lomo1968,"April 19, 2019","Love, love, LOVE these pens. WHY? I am a genealogist and it is a MUST that I have different colored pens that
I can write small wording in US Census sheets and be able to read the ink. These
pens more than fit the bill. I can use one color for each surname and also the colors such as the pale
oranges, one yellow and the soft pink can be used to do small, neat lining
and/or highlighting. Being .38mm my cursive is nice and neat. I still do snail mail, and to be
honest, this gives my Pilot extra fine nib fountain pen a good run for the money
for the way they both write! These fit easily in my hand, are very slim, slimmer than a 2H Graphite pencil.
Writing with these are a pleasure. The barrel close to the bottom, where the
color is clear does have a small “ridge” and that can get rough if your hand
slips with your writing.The color selection is excellent and although the numbers to identify each color
is different, I wish the actual color was listed on the barrel: other than those
minor issues, I would recommend highly.These are a true joy to use!"
jmayeu,"September 2, 2021",Perfect for taking notes in the margins of my Bibles. 
phoebe.mogharei,"April 27, 2021","Wow. Incredible. I wasn't living until I got these pens. I needed colored pens
to plan out my schedule, but since things change I needed the ability to erase.
These really erase well. You just have to be careful because they're fine point,
so they can leave a light indentation in the paper if you press hard like me.
But they're gel pens so the ink flows beautifully—just ease up your hand and
you'll be living your best life. "
swallard,"October 21, 2020","Great slim gel pens - although the lighter ink colors can be faint on off-white
paper."
Carolee,"October 11, 2020","I *love* that JetPens created this bundle. They came rubber-banded together in
my package. The rubber band loosened and many got loose, but thanks to the
careful packaging, no ink leaked, and no pens were damaged. There is an amazing
selection of colors. I really like the FriXion ink's erasability and this tiny
line (.38) is the best. I was impressed that the yellow in this set--honey
yellow--is visible on paper. (Often yellow inks are hard/nearly impossible to
see.) The thin barrel makes them super-portable and the ink is incredibly
reliable. In my many (!) FriXion pens, I've never had issues with skipping ink
and they always write smoothly. My most favorite FriXion is the Point Knock .4,
but it doesn't have nearly this many colors. Highly recommend these with the
caveat that 20 different inks *might* not be a good idea if you experience
decision fatigue. Ha."
absenseofsanity,"July 20, 2020",Love the needle tip on these. Great for planner notes.
flambiase,"April 6, 2020","I love these pens for my planner! The ink is smooth and doesn't leave smudges,

completely, as well, which is handy for changes of plans. "

be completely used up by the end of this month.  All I am doing is writing with
them.  I'm not coloring with them or highlighting.  Just writing.  I estimate
that the ink in one pen will write about four 8 1/2 by 11 inch sheets of lined
paper.  That's how fast the ink runs out.  This is too expensive for me.  "

either, so I find the price very hard to justify."
emjacobsarts,"July 7, 2017","I was very surprised that these came in two bubble wrapped bundles with no

have to order the whole bundle again to guarantee I'd receive the right ones and
if I just guess I'd probably not get the correct pen. Not really a big deal, but
an annoyance.  "
Chris,"November 20, 2012","I really went back and forth on this.  At first, I wanted to rate the pen a 3. 
However, I decided on 4 because of the build quality of the pen and the fact
that they make an adapter for the ink. Really the review needs two parts.   1. The Pen - This is an awesome pen.  The weight is perfect, the hand feel is
great.  The nib writes smoothly and evenly.  It feels good against the paper
with just enough tactile feedback.  2. The ink - The ink is horrible.  I got the blue ink and it is the worst ink I
have ever written with.  The blue color is weak and looks like someone took REAL
ink and watered it down.  It doesn't last.  The color fades quickly.  I have
been using the pen for about 3 months and the stuff I wrote when I first got it
looks worse than it did when I first wrote it.   My suggestion, buy the pen and the ink adapter. Never even put in the lamy ink
cartridge.  Buy some really good ink and enjoy a great pen that writes perfectly
and evenly.  The pen is great, the ink is not.  "
blindingmask,"September 24, 2013","There are a number of reviews on this pen, but even having read dozens sourced
from Google and JetPens I still wasn't sure what I was getting into. I'll lay
this down so I will be the last to wonder. The body: Lightly textured dark grey. This pen is different from the smooth glossy
versions, it has a noticeable grip to the surface. I consider this a boon, but
this is a departure from the norm. The notched grip makes the pen feel much more
thin when held, I measure the diameter to be 3/8"" compared to 7/16"" if the
notches were absent. for comparison, a cheap papermate is 5/16"" in diameter.
Combined with the relative lightness of the body, the result is that the pen
feels stable. This pen is not amenable to holding in any other way, so you might need a moment
to adjust to the grip. I had previously only used round pens before, so I had an
unorthodox grip. The result is that writing became very uncomfortable, but
looked much neater! The clip is sturdy but flexible. The unique design means you can fit a small
karabiner or lanyard loop on the cap and stick the pen essentially anywhere.
This was the primary reason I went after this pen, and it was well worth it.
Clip it to your bag or wear around the neck: awesome. The ink window functions. I am using the converter with Herbin noir. if you hold
the pen point down for a moment, you can see the level clearly. Overall the pen is not very flashy, but it feels like a solid tool. If you want
elegance, this pen will disappoint, it looks and feels like the Navy Seals
official fountain pen. The Nib:Reviews don't lie, calling this ""Extra Fine"" is a stretch. On Strathmore Sketch
400 series the line is equivalent to a .5 mm pencil on my pen. This goes up to
.7 mm on a Mead notebook. I would provide pictures, but there are a few
comparisons already out there. When I want a thinner line, I just flip the pen.
This gives essentially .3 mm and .5 mm lines respectively. The surprising thing
was how smoothly the pen glides, even when writing flipped over. I can write
sentences smoothly then flip over and draw fine chemical structures with no
issues whatsoever. I was expecting more of a scratch. It is definitely not as
smooth as the gold tipped Mount Blancs I've tried, but compares very well to my
multitudes of Speedball dip pens for simple writing. DO get a converter and your favorite ink. It came with one blue cartridge. The
line is, like others have noted, a bit on the dry side, so be prepared for a
little grey to come through if your paper is absorbent. Herbin's pearl noir
comes out a shade grey when used on a rather absorbent notebook, but I enjoy the
look. Don't expect much flex in the nib. The entire system is pretty solid as a
theme. TL/DR:Very solid. Navy seals. Prefers proper grip. Two very usable sides. Smooth, but
not gold. Not ""Extra"" fine (.5 to .7 mm). Well worth the price. Use the clip
with a cord!"
Watercycle,"July 7, 2011","beautiful writing on standard American notebook paper as many find it dreadful
with some fountain pens no scratch, no feather, little bleed(a small bit more than any 0.7mm ballpoint
pen) love the blue ink! i would describe it as electric, i was going to pop out the
cartridge right away for the converter and ink bottle i ordered, but man, i'll
stick with this until it's out =) the EF from Lamy is the exact fountain pen size i wanted with notebook, small,
yet it doesn't take detail away from the fact your using a fountain pen. perfect with cursive script and Japanese! ^^ and no ""bling"", a every-day pen you can use without looking like your trying to
impress somebody"
philip.milazzo,"January 25, 2012","The Charcoal Safari in Extra Fine writes very, very nicely and its flat black
body and glossy black nib are all business. The size, weight and balance of the
ABS body make for comfortable writing, cap posted or not. The EF nib glides
across any old paper I have so far tried, leaving a sharp, reliable line of blue
from the supplied cartridge. I have a converter at the ready once I exhaust the
cartridge and anticipate buying a spare nib in a different width, just for some
variety. This pen is just the ticket for the basic pen fan and constant user. For a true
beginner still deciding between ""yes"" and ""no"" on the subject of the fountain
pen, there are alternatives in lower price ranges. If you already love fountain
pens and do not have a Lamy Safari, buy one without hesitation and enjoy it as I
do mine. I would rate this pen five stars (and more if permitted to) at a more
competitive price."
gtrplyraj,"January 6, 2013","This is my first entry into fountain pens. I did have some experience with dip
pens in college, so writing with a nib wasn't totally foreign, but these days my
pens of choice have been the Uniball 207s gels and Vision Micro rollers. The pen is extremely handsome. The plastic body is thick and feels very rugged
while remaining quite light. The pen does, however, feel ever so slightly
unbalanced with the cap posted on the back. The EF tip doesn't give a lot of
variation in line width, so on paper (with a blue-black Monteverde cartridge)
gives a very similar look to a Uniball Vision Micro black. The nib, out of the
box, gave a very smooth writing experience... didn't have to deal with a
break-in period. I do have to say that using a fountain pen in meetings with clients has become a
conversation starter. I enjoy not only the writing experience, but the
psychological effect it seems to hold on people around me when I use it."
hawksma1,"November 8, 2014","Its german. It is a pleasure to write with, very sturdy yet light weight; its
quality and longevity are dependable and thats worth a lot."
katieperez862,"July 12, 2014","I am a somewhat new customer and already HUGE fan of Jetpens.com!  I have
enjoyed everything so much I have purchased, especially my brand-new Lamy Safari
(charcoal) with EF nib.  Itreated myself for my five-year quit smoking
anniversary this last 4th of July with my new pen!  I only wish I had bought
some blue cartridges.  I did also buy a Lamy Z-24 converter and am using it with
some Quink black ink I have been using in my Esterbrook pens, for a long time. 
I have to say the converter is for me so much easier to use than the
lever/bladder kind.  But Esterbrook pens still have a place in my heart.  But my
Lamy is front and center.  One morning recently I woke up to get ready to come
to work and discovered my Lamy Safari still clipped to the neck of my nightgown
from the evening before!  I look forward to trying different inks.  I will
probably go with Pelikan Royal Blue.  I explored the reviews people wrote and
looked at the ink comparison feature on your website.  "
GeoSoto,"May 23, 2013","Wow is really all I can say. I'm new to the fountain pen experience maybe messed
around with them when I was young and in art class like most but that was
calligraphy stuff never really just writing. So this was my second pen first one
was the dirty cheap Platinum Preppy and for the price that worked just as I
expected a $3 pen would work. Now the time I'm mainly using pens are when I'm
note taking in college so I to write pretty quickly. The Preppy was Ok at that
it had a lot of bleed on my mead notebooks so when I got this pen Lord Jesus it
was a world of difference no bleed and now i have neat looking notes to archive
for later studying. the only complaint is that i wish the pen body was a little
more of a deep darker charcoal black besides that nothing to really complain
about. If your trying to get into fountain pens this is the way to get into it
its a smooth pen and wonderful. Glides like butter over paper. fine crisp lines
and it never ever skips a beat. Once you buy one you'll want to get another and
another and another. You wont regret this pen!"
jkrall1066,"December 21, 2017","Very disappointed. The extra fine nib is the equivalent of a medium nib in the
Platinum Preppy. The line is far too broad for my handwriting. It bleeds ink.
Looks more like writing done with a felt-tip pen. I wish this weren't so because
it's a very nice looking pen and writes smoothly. "
lynn1816,"March 19, 2017","I love the feel while holding it, but it doesn't feel like or look like it is
truly extra fine. A bit disappointed in that respect."
Brent Blake,"September 3, 2020","My Lamy Safari EF arrived today. I cant stop writing with this pen. This pen
almost does the writing for you. As light weight as the Safari is I was nervous
as I picked it up, but as I put it to paper.... ""oh, wow... that's really nice.
No, that's REALLY nice."" I bought a converter and needle right off to go with
this one. Well worth the more frequent fillings I will have the go through, and
much more sturdy than my other Chinese piston Moonman (wrote wonderfully but the
piston mechanism has now gone ka-put... don't drop em). The EF nib is exactly
what I expected/ wanted (very much unlike the twsbi eco EF I previously rated
with just 2 stars). Again, notes and writing have become a real pleasure again.  "
owllight,"May 3, 2019","I like the pen...at first I was put off because it really is NOT an extra fine
nib to my way of thinking. Still, I like the way it handles. It is a bit light
for my taste, but the paper feel is highly satisfactory. Reminds me of Pelikan.
It feels good in my small/medium hands. It is a good pen, but I still need an
extra fine point. "
jeff_ii,"August 4, 2012","Great pen - it works on all types of paper, from Rhodia/Clairefontaine to the
regular 20 lb. paper used in our laser printers.  I am a fairly new fountain pen
user, and I haven't had any problems with this pen skipping or not starting -
wish I could say the same for some of the more expensive pens I have purchased."
Yoyochanny,"March 15, 2012","This is a great starter fountain pen, though I found the extra fine nib to be a
bit too scratchy for my tastes.  It is very easy to clean, and the
interchangeable nibs are a great addition, since it helped me figure out which
nib I liked best.  Between extra fine, fine, and medium, it ended up being fine;
sets down a line that is in the ""goldilocks zone"" for me.  Fine and medium are
extremely smooth, and surf along the page on a nice wet line... extra-fine kind
of stalls (though it's alright if you write at a very slanted angle.  Better for
cursive, printed letters are very sketchy.) The matte plastic of this model is great if you hate fingerprints on the barrel,
since this does not show them at all.  The cap is secure enough without being
too tight, and the clip is very strong, but still flexible.  I love that it
takes cartridges and a converter... great for me, since I change my mind about
colors very often.  The converter is great for your favorite workhorse ink that
you end up using a lot of. All-around very good, but I just don't like this thickness of nib.  If you have
somewhat broad handwriting like myself, try the fine nib instead."
darby,"May 30, 2011","I've been using Lamy Safari pens for years now and they are among the best, if
you like a lightweight pen that flows smoothly, never blots or leaks, and looks
good. I recommend the medium or fine nibs, but not the extra fine: it is
scratchy and the ink doesn't flow well. However, Lamy's interchangeable nibs
make changing easy and relatively cheap."
sperucch,"March 3, 2011","Ordered it on Monday, arrived on Thursday. Worked perfectly right out of the
box, with the extra fine nib being big enough to give my writing some
consistency without making it bulky. Writing (with the lamy blue ink cartridge included) is incredibly smooth and
unbroken, requiring only the contact of the pen on paper--no pressure. I immediately noticed that the pen becomes top heavy when posted, but it is very
light if the cap is left off. The grip forces my hand into the proper position
for writing, managing to do in seconds what my mother tried to teach me years
ago :) I am definitely going to buy the converter for the pen and try it with some
Noodler's ink.  Certainly a good pen, and I have to say I like the utilitarian look as well!"
Tanz,"January 6, 2009","This is my first fountain pen, and after reading reviews from other sources,
they said this was the best pen under $100 or something like that. And its been
a great buy. I'm a forgetful person, so there would be times where I think I
lost it, and my heart just dropped. I'm okay with dropping it all the time as
well, since I am a clutz. I had always bought ballpoint pens, and the ink on
this pen flows ten times smoother than the pilot gel pens you get at target. I'm
also a student studying illustration, so this is great for art studies. I use it
for everything, from writing, sketching, to drawing. Its useful to draw over
graphite as well, because I know that it wont' take back in the graphite when I
use it, unlike ballpoint. I love mine because it writes like a dream. I can
lightly touch the tip, and it will still flow out smooth, so I don't need to
strain my hands to press down hard. Really helpful for the people who press down
to hard. You don't see much compression on the back of paper."
vadius,"March 28, 2008","Be sure to check the nib when you get it. I somehow received the bold nib
version of this (even though the box clearly says ""EX FINE""). The bold version
has a ""B"" on the nib, whereas the extra fine has ""EF"" on the nib."
colevcline,"July 26, 2022","The pen itself is nice to hold and write with. The unique grip shape isn't hard
to hold even with a lateral tripod grip. My only problem is with the nib size.
Lamy nib sizes are pretty inconsistent, and my other Lamy, a Studio, has an EF
tip as well. Yet, when I compared them side-by-side, there was a massive
difference in thickness. This one had a much broader, wetter line. For me, it
was too broad to be usable in my Hobonichi Techo. I swapped out the nibs between
my pens and I can use this one for planning now, but  Lamy nibs can be a real
gamble. The utilitarian sort of look is nice and it's a good pen for EDC as a planner
and journaler. I don't have to worry about scratches as much as other materials
or colors. "
Rice,"May 11, 2022","I actually ordered an F nib and received an EF accidentally but I'm glad I did!
I love the EF nib. I had avoided it at first because I had heard the Lamy EF
nibs were scratchy but I wrote with this pen for hours and never experienced any
scratchiness. It's actually very smooth! And I love the precision with it. I
also haven't had nearly as many skips as with the Pilot Kakuno so I consider
this an upgrade. Definitely makes me want to try more Lamy pens. "

sarikamittra,"January 7, 2022","Amazing pen. It's light, has a matte body and is neither too thick or thin. The
EF nib is thin but I find it a tad thicker than a Japanese fine nib. This might
be because my letters are small and the ink pools a bit. It's a great pen that I
use daily. The nib is smooth without being too slippery. I've also used it on
the Midori MD notebook that has slightly toothier pages but have not experienced
any marked scratchiness. "

Carla,"July 16, 2021","The pen itself is my first real fountain pen.I like how easy it is to clean and change ink.The nib is smooth and lovely. It allows for the ink to flow wonderfully. The build quality seems rugged yet not heavy. I feel like it can handle an accidental drop just fine. HOWEVER, the first ink I used was not the one provided. I have just changed ink cartridges to try out the blue Lamy ink the pen came
with and I must say if I had started with that ink I would have considered the
pen a bad pen. The blue ink is blotchy, incredibly so. The letters don't dry in a uniform color, it is overall a horrible ink. The pen is great, it deserves good ink. "

in grad school"
surfbird,"March 19, 2021","I love this pen, but it is imperfect.  The flow isn't consistent.  When you
first use it there's a lot of ink ready to write with and then after a sentence
or two it can become a bit dry. It is easy to adjust for or take a beat to
pause.  What I LOVE about it is the way the nib feels when writing.  it's so
smooth and just a joy to move around on paper.  The shape of the pen is a bit
weirdly long.  It is balanced enough to write without the cap on it but just
barely.  with the cap on works great but then it is very tall.   The clip is big and if i were to clip it to my shirt pocket...which i
don't...i'm sure that'd be easy.  But as such, if laying the pen flat the clip
props up the nib and removes ink from the tip.  Again, easy to deal with.  I'm not sure i would buy this one again but am super happy with it despite it's
easily overlooked imperfections. "

didn't think I would take to this, but I really enjoy writing with it.  The
extra fine nib feels about the same Pilot fine, but I seem to get more ink on
the page with the Pilot (this could also just be the ink- I use cartridge
refills so I have not used the same ink in both to compare).The indentations are a great place to rest my fingers and help ensure I am
holding the pen in the optimal position.  It's not like I like this better than
the Pilot Metro, they're different, but equally fun to write with (though I do
find that the Safari makes me feel a bit more stylish)."
kacreekside,"November 23, 2020",Doesn’t write smoothly
Ickabod,"October 23, 2020","I have mixed feelings on this pen. The nib is closer to a fine, and it took two
days of fiddling and tweaking to get the pen to even work. I flushed and cleaned
it well out of box, and installed the converter with some trusted ink, and it
was the most dry pen I've ever owned, (I am a pen addict, I own A LOT of pens).
It didn't lay down ink at all most of the time. Maybe mine was a fluke? I almost
gave myself carpel tunnel trying to get this pen to behave. I use fountain pens
for art, so every line counts, and this one is unreliable in flow. I kept trying
at it, and eventually flow got better, so maybe it just needed to be broken in.Plus some stars because it is lightweight and feels nice to hold while
sketching.Negative stars because it gave me grief, and when it does work, the nib is a
fine nib.If you use fountain pens for detailed line art and ink work, Twsbi and Kaweco
are my personal favs, and worth a look."
johnlipman,"September 25, 2020","I bought this pen because it was mentioned/recommended by Alphonso Dunn in one
of his youtube videos.  I am very happy with it.  The angled grip forces you to
hold the pen in a certain way and I find it very comfortable and the ef nib is
just right for me.  I also bought the converter which I am also happy with.  The
pen has a clip that could star as  the hero of its own action adventure film: 
it is so strong and aggressive - it seems able to hold on to anything.  And the
pen is so unobtrusive and modest looking.  A great buy and deserving of its five
stars.  I must say, however, I am a little uncertain as to the utility and
functionality of the viewing port that is supposed to let you monitor your ink
supply. the  only way I knew I was out of ink and in need of a refill is when
the  pen went dry and stopped writing.  I'd be happy to hear from anyone who has
figured out how to use the little window/ink supply monitor."
AD33,"September 23, 2020","I'm on the fence about the Lamy Safari.  The good is that it writes smoothly and
I'm not sorry I bought it.  The bad is that the ""extra fine"" nib writes like a
medium nib in my opinion.  I prefer fine and extra fine nibs and tips, so that's
why I only give it 3 stars. This definitely won't be my go to / every day
fountain pen.  There are no faults with the pen, it is just my personal
preference.  "
Bee9,"September 10, 2020","Not for me.  While I like the look of the pen, the nib is very stiff and

dayonpark,"July 24, 2020","Just started using fountain pens in general and really enjoying this one. This
is my second FP, after Pilot metro Fnib, and do enjoy them both. Two pens are
indeed different and has their own strong and weak points. As for the Lamy, I really like the way it looks. It look industrial, sturdy,
German. I've read many posts and reviews about the grip on this pen and it seems
like it is a matter of personal taste. As for me, I really like the grip and it
fits just right between my fingers. Writes fairly smoothly but not as smooth as
the Pilot. Now compared to the fine nib on the Pilot, the extra fine nib on Lamy
seems to write with similar thickness, if not thicker. Something to keep in mind
if you are worried that EF nib on Lamy may be to thin.4 stars considering the thickness of the EF nib and smoothness compared to Pilot
Metro? Probably. But 5 stars because I really like to look and feel of this pen
in my hand. "

already order a LAMY 2000, so the answer was yes. "
unsavedfeelings,"February 17, 2020","Amazing, a must-have for anyone new into fountain pens"
nikhilavijay,"February 6, 2020","This is my second Lamy, and first Lamy Safari. I specifically ordered the extra
fine nib since my handwriting is pretty large and I almost exclusively write in
lined notebooks. I had a bumpier ride getting used to this one. The ""scratchy"" nature of the
extra fine nib is well documented and makes sense. However, I had a really hard
time getting a continuous, stable flow of ink from the nib. Someone gave me a
suggestion that the sections of the nib immediately to the left and right of the
line down the centre of the nib should always be in contact with paper for
optimum ink flow. Being conscious of this positioning has indeed improved ink
flow. I docked one star for the slightly uncomfortable texture from the matte finish
of the pen. I through the finish would only be visual, not textural. If you have
sensitive fingertips, you might want an untextured finish. "
Skyla,"January 21, 2020","I honestly really love this pen! The EF nib is surprisingly smooth and the
feedback from the paper is just right. It really feels like I'm writing with a
soft lead pencil. The body is a lightweight plastic that seems durable, and has
this soft texture to it, helping with grip. The ink window is a nice added
feature as well. My only issues with this pen are that the shape of the grip
section forces you to hold the pen a particular way,  which was rather awkward
at first, though I have gotten used to it, and that it seems just a tad pricey
for what it is.  I like it much more than my Pilot Metropolitan EF (which feels cheap compared to
the LAMY), and about the same as my TWSBI ECO EF (which has a much scratchier
feedback but holds more ink and is definitely more solid). The blue ink cartridge it comes with is a lovely color, with a hint of lavender
to the blue (comparable in shade to the Pilot Iroshizuku Ajisai) but is
definitely a drier ink (though that helps with making your lines stay sharp with
the EF nib!). Over all though, it's a really great fountain pen and I reccomend it to anyone
looking for a step up from cheaper beginner pens to something a little more
grown up feeling."
CatWizard ,"January 4, 2020","Great pen, flow is not too wet, but the  EF nib is the same fineness as my Pilot
M and Twsbi F nibs. I bought a LAMY Aion, and the nib is so much finer. All LAMY
pens that I have tried (Safari, AL star, Aion) are good, but there needs to be
more consistency in the line width. Maybe I just got a defective (but still
amazing) pen"
yenson.lau,"September 11, 2019","I actually love the feel of the pen and the ergonomic grip; it is a lot less
stressful on my fingers for long periods of writing compared to my Pilot Metro. Unfortunately, however, the nib wrote far too wide and too wet out of the box,
so I had to get a replacement nib. Pen wrote great afterwards."
pen.scribe2,"July 16, 2019","Arrived in timely manner. Carefully packaged. Was exactly as advertised. The mat

chrispmoellering,"May 13, 2019","This is really a great pen. Well constructed, writes great and reliably, just
like all the Safaris. I really like it's all-black look. I appreciate the
details, like how the convertor actually snaps into the pen.My only complaint is it is not a Pilot Metropolitan. What I mean by that is the
EF is an European EF, not a Japanese EF. In my experience, it is just a touch
broader than my Pilot fine nibs.But it is a great EDC pen. That matte finish is slightly textured and wears well
and hides those things it can't just shake off."
Guokun.cao,"May 3, 2019",Beautiful beginner pen with great ink flow. 
communistdaughter,"March 15, 2019","This pen is a high-quality, well-designed workhorse. It's a little bit pricey
but in my opinion it is worth it.Smoothness of writing: 8/10The pen writes a little scratchily at first but smoothens out after a few
paragraphs. I had no problems with leakage. The flow is a little wet. Lamy nibs
are a little wider than other Western brands, so keep that in mind.Design: 10/10The pen is a pleasure to hold. The triangular grip section helped me to kick
some of my poor writing habits. Although the whole pen is plastic, the quality
is excellent and doesn't feel cheap at all.The Safari also has the ability to have its nibs changed, adding a little
versatility. Overall, a great buy."
susanderse,"February 15, 2019",1-not extra fine writing2-the hand position is way too far from the nib.  It’s pretty much unusable

the pen itself is fantastic in design and functionality."
natnat,"November 19, 2018","This is my first Lamy and I love it. I think extra fine was great for me since
it resembles more of a fine. I personally like the grip and the little ink
window. I didn't use the blue cartridge since I also bought a converter, so I
can't attest to the ink. Overall I understand why it is such a beloved pen and
look forward to future Lamy pens. "

bridgette,"January 25, 2018",A lovely extra-fine fountain pen. The tri-grip works great with my finger size!
Evan,"January 4, 2018","Nice robust design. The pen is heavy compared to the Platinum Preppy (a favorite
of mine) but I only noticed that after picking up a Preppy after using this. It
can sometimes irritate the hand when posted due to the slightly sharp edge.
That's a minor problem and I'll probably forget about it eventually. The clip is nice and large. It doesn't get hung up and I'm not afraid of
breaking it off when I clip it to pants or shirt. The clip is tighter than I
expected. I like the viewing window and the flat spots which prevent the pen from rolling.
The clip helps for that too. The matte finish gives it a solid look and feel in
the hand. I like the extra grip the texture provides. The blue ink is the perfect color. Dark enough to provide a high contrast for
reading, but enough color that I can tell where I've written on a typed page at
a glance. I take a lot of notes on emails and blueprints next to the typed words
and computer generated lines. I often need to write a lot in a small area. I
have not tested its water resistance yet. The tip is the only reason I give this a 4 and not a 5 star. If you like big
tips, don't let this deter you. I tend to need extra fine tips like the Platinum
preppy 02 and sometimes I even have to use a sakura pigma micron 005 or 003 for
my work. Even the EF nib for Lamy is thick and juicy for my needs. I wish there
was a western equivalent for the Japanese EF nibs. No scratch at all and on some
papers it lays down a beautiful line. Sometimes it gets even thicker or
feathers. I don't have the luxury of working with fountain pen friendly paper. I
need to be able to write on whatever comes by my desk. That's the purpose of a
pen. As a previous review pointed out it does put down a nicer fine line when flipped
over. I may be using it more in this orientation from now on. "
Tana,"December 9, 2017","Love this pen so much. I bought this and a twsbi eco at the same time. Twsbi
leaked all over and had a loose nib that constantly needed readjusting but lamy
was perfect and reliable. Beautiful lines. So sad that I only had it a month
before I lost it but will be purchasing more in different colors."
Cats,"December 1, 2017","I bought this pen with the converter, and used Diamine Oxblood ink. This is my
first non-japanese fountain pen.The pen body itself was great. The build quality was good, the color was nice,
and the grip was not too bad. I was expecting it to be heavier and have a more firm ""click"" when putting the
cap on it, but otherwise, good all around pen body.The nib was sub-par. I don't know if I just got a lemon, or I just prefer
Japanese nibs, but the nib on this was very scratchy. Overall, it didn't feel as
good as even my Platinum Preppy.If you want a great, low-priced, workhorse pen with excellent build quality in
exchange for a not-so-excellent nib, get this pen. If you want something that
writes incredibly smooth and luxuriously, then get a Pilot Metro."
sasoup99,"September 14, 2017","Writes wonderfully! Currently using in my Baron Fig vanguards & confidant

hannibalwilldo,"April 24, 2017","This tops most of the fountain pens I've purchased here (for now). It's sleek,
it's got style, and it writes so smooth that I'm actually giddy every time I use
it. It glides on the surface of the paper, making you feel like your hand is ice
skating. Of course, the performance depends upon the kind of paper. It does well
with the cheap ones, but on everything else? It's fan-bloody-tastic."
lanatrann,"April 12, 2017","I like the design of the pen. I have the pilot metropolitan fountain pen and the
metal body feels heavy in my hand and eventually felt uncomfortable. Even though
the Lamy is made of plastic it's good quality, I accidentally drove over the pen
with my car. I expected it to break and explode ink everywhere but to my
surprise the only damage was some light scratches from being smashed between the
car tire and cement. The nib does feel a bit scratchy compared to the
metropolitan but it doesn't peel the paper. It's a great fountain pen."

there, I think."
m5honor,"March 6, 2017","The Lamy's are superb fountain pens. Very light, so you can flow right across a

always perform like you're using a feather pen...very light, and allows for an
incredible expression in your writing style. I have 6 or 8 of these, each loaded
with a different ink. I use it for work, for drawing, for taking notes at a
meeting. Always flows easily and quickly. Plus, they are so light that they
don't weigh down your shirt pocket. You can have 3 or 4 of them in your pocket
and you can hardly even feel them. Wonderful pen! "

MiniMoo,"April 5, 2016","Great pen, inconsistent nib qualityThis is my second Safari. The first three Lamy nibs (the one that came with my
first one, plus two replacement nibs) were great, but this one was very badly
out-of-tune -- wide ink channel, but pinched closed at the tip -- for terrible
ink flow. I replaced it with my silver EF replacement nib, and it worked fine.

Safari as my first fountain pen. Having used the pen for about 2 weeks i can say
that i really enjoyed the pens clip(sturdy), the window to see when the ink is
running out and the triangular shape grip at the bottom of the pen to write.
(after a while it sort of got uncomfortable, you will either really like this or
not at all) What i did not like about the pen is that the ink it comes with it is pretty
bad(i bought noodler's black ink to replace the bad ink and used the converter),
and the extra fine nib is a bit to scratchy for my taste maybe i got a bad nib
idk( it feels like i am writing with a number 2 pencil, take into account that i
used regular mead and printing paper).  In all honesty, now that i have used the Pilot Metropolitan fine nib, i can say
it is much smoother than the Lamy. "
jetaimejsc9,"November 9, 2015","For a beginner, this pen does the job well and its not too expensive. I chose
the EF because I am used to .05 mechanical pencils and the EF nib is great. I am
using this pen with a Lamy converter with Waterman Intense black ink and I have
yet to have any problems. Save yourself the trouble of buying one from amazon or
ebay and possibly getting a fake. Jetpens free shipping was fairly quick to
deliver.Español:Yo soy un novato cuando se trata de este tipo de lapizeras y al precio de esta,

Pen Addict,"November 5, 2015","Nice pen overall, would recommend it to others. "
Sccc,"October 23, 2015","My very first fountain pen, and I'm enjoying using it a lot so far. The only
thing I'd point out for future buyers is that I found the color to be an
ever-so-slightly-brownish grey than a completely neutral grey, which I didn't
really mind too much. The pen body is also a bit larger than what a pen novice
like me would expect, especially since the pen cap has a somewhat large
diameter. Even so it's extremely light and feels very comfortable in my hand.The line width is also thicker than what you'd expect from a nib size described
as ""extra fine""- again, I'm a beginner to these types of pens so I'm limited to
what I can compare it with, but I'd say it's about the thickness of a 0.7 Pilot
G2, which might be too thick for some people. Fortunately I found that it writes
surprisingly well with the nib upside-down, in which case it writes about as
thick as a 0.38 Pilot G2.I also didn't care very much for the plain blue ink cartridge it came with; I
mixed it with some black Diamine ink to get an interesting blue-black color
instead."
Jones,"September 27, 2015","This is your workhorse. Strong and straightforward and none too delicate. If you
have tiny handwriting or need to be able to take notes on regular notebook
paper, then this is not your pen. Consider Pilot's Metropolitan in those
cases--extra fine. German sizing runs larger than Japanese sizing. However, this
pen is light, posted or not, and responds quite well for so stiff a nib (nicer
nibs tend to cost significantly more than this). If you've never bought a fountain pen before, but would like to start well and
see where it goes, then choose this. It can accomodate a converter which will
open up a world of color to you. I prefer Diamine inks, but have heard good
reports from several others. I've never used the included cartridge. Consider
adding a converter and a small bottle of Diamine Jet Black when you order this
and you'll be ready to go.I haven't seen many complaints about the weight of the pen. It certainly IS
heavier than a day to day ballpoint, clicky piece of nonsense or a one time use
fountain pen throw away, but if you are a writer or a student with some decent
paper, this pen will not fail you. For economical paper options, I strongly
recommend the Maruman Eco Spiral Note to begin. If you are serious about finding
your way to a more elegant, thoughtful writing process or just a really cool,
basic pen that will stand out to anyone attentive, then begin here. "

usually, nor is businesslike. I like this anyway. It's a Safari."

jackymayonaise,"February 8, 2015","Just a disclaimer, since this is the first fountain pen I've ever used,
therefore my review cannot be taken into consideration too heavily.To begin, the design of the pen is just phenomenal. It slips into my pencil case
perfectly with the large hook that comes with it and feels amazing when I grip
it. The ink flows out really smoothly and the nib feels fantastic. All my
friends awe and wow when I show them this fountain pen and let them use it. It's
also pretty durable; one time my cousin threw the pen (with it's cap on at
least) and it dropped around 2metres. I was super pissed and was about to lash
out on him but to my surprise nothing happened and it was in perfect condition.However, sometimes it does get a little too inky and the other end gets on my
fingers; but I feel like that's maybe how fountain pens work and I haven't
gotten used to it. Another problem is the weight of the cap is strange and
doesn't balance well when you place it on top of the pen to write with. It's a
TINY quirk and I simply just don't put the cap on when writing to avoid this
problem."
jroberts264,"February 1, 2015","Love this pen. Of all the ones I have I find myself making my way back to this

losing it or someone else walking off with it would be the end of the world"

attjle22,"December 2, 2014","I was amazed how light this pen was. It feels like writing with air. I like to
keep the cap posted to give it a little more weight. The window displaying the
inkwell is fabulously convenient. It's a good, reliable pen. I've had no
problems with it. The black metal nib is my favorite part of the pen, unique!
The clip is very sturdy-the entire pen is sturdy, in fact. It does write a bit
thicker line than I'd thought, but I'm okay with it. Overall, I love my pen!"
theundergroundninja,"November 5, 2014","This is my first fountain pen and I fell in love with it.  It took some getting
used to the feel on paper (somewhat ""scratchy"" compared to ballpoint), but now
everything else just feels strange.  My handwriting clarity has actually
improved because I have to be more deliberate with my strokes.  I also
appreciate the ink level window, grooved finger grip, and industrial styling. 
As a plus, nobody wanders off with my pen because they pop the cap and exclaim,
""What the...,"" then put it back in favor of the cheap ballpoints littering their
desk.  Will definitely buy another when this one no longer works."
satwinderd,"January 27, 2014","This is a great pen, especially for those who are starting with fountain pens.
The weight of this is not too heavy or too light, it is just right, even though
I like heavier pens. The EF Nib is superb and I haven't seen it skip yet, I had
one of these YEARS ago as gift from a friend and when I lost it I ordered this
off of jetpens, the shipping was fast. My two gripes with this pen is that when I opened the package, the cartridge had
magically been pierced and was all over the nib and the box and I cleaned it up.
I used the ink because I may as well use it since it's already in the feed and
nib... The color is HORRIBLE, and fades too quickly. My advice is, get ink when you purchase this, because it is just wayyy too
watered down-looking. The other gripe was that it has a hole in the barrel so I
can't do an eyedropper conversion. A great work-around would be if Lamy made that portion of the pen with clear
plastic instead of making a hole so it could be safer even for those who want to
use cartridges or converters, as the ink would not somehow get out and make a
mess in your hands or pockets.  If Lamy did that, I would buy a million of these. These are great pens and the
nibs are also very good. You may want to clean the feed and nib by using a converter to flush them with
water, or take off the nib with a piece of scotch tape and clean it that way
because Lamy tests each and every pen that comes off the assembly line."
carlosbmenchaca,"November 14, 2013","Loved this pen, the EF nib is slightly scratchy, but i don't mind at all. Some

I love it for that..Also on watercolor paper..very smooth and good solid line.
The nib does have the dreaded nib creep..but..it's not an issue for me..some
folks complain about it. It's an OK FP. Nothing fancy..it works..so far..no leaking with the plastic
converter so that's a plus..otherwise it's a nicely designed, hefty, rugged pen.

daniel.kiselev,"July 13, 2013","I just got this pen, and really I don't see anything bad about it. Some people
say it writes too thick, I say it rights like a   Japanese f pen(maybe slightly
smaller). Only two iffy things about this pen is that the grip is made so it is
uncomfortable to use this pen unless you write in the standard grip they teach
you in school(I converted to this style about a year ago). Also, the included
ink cartridge isnt exactly the best, but then again you can just buy a converter
and  use a different brand ink. All in all, this pen is amazing, but the ink is
not. Then again this review is about a pen, not a free complimentary ink
cartridge. 5/5"

like a piece of modern art worthy of a museum display. "
nolanjsmith,"January 10, 2013","Tremendously smooth writer. I have the medium nib and am very satisfied with it.
This immediately moved to one of my favorites for a daily writer. I find the
grip section very comfortable and also aids in holding the correct nib position
in alignment with the paper so that it consistently makes great contact in long
writing sessions. There is nothing I could say poorly of the pen. Buy it. Stop
fretting - it's a great pen at any price range. "

smooth on all the paper I tried. The only short coming is that it does seem a
little bit bolder than my other EF nib from ""Pen & Ink"" (which only sketch
smoothly on Moleskine sketchbook...) but it is still thinner than F nib on
rotring initial."

a LOT of prliminary work in his sketchbook. For years, i have been designing my
ideas using Micron pens. Then comes SAFARI, loaded with a converter and Noodlers
bulletproof black ink. Bye bye microns (no offence to Sakura who makes some fine
disposable pens). This will do the trick. Great feeling pen, easy to refill and
smoothe as butter writing/drawing. Delivered early before we went on vacation so
it will be going to California with me for its first outing. Thanks Jet Pens
once again."
sbmull,"March 16, 2012","I have use this pen for years and find that the nib size you will need is based
on two factors: 1) Size of your handwriting2) Smoothness of paper The Extra fine nib WILL catch or grab if you do not have small handwriting and
good paper.   Consider a regular nib or a fine first.  If the regular or fine
give two broad of a line for your handwriting and are not catching the paper,
try a EF.   In summary, if this is your first fountain pen, do not go small than a fine."
revo88,"February 27, 2012","I'm very pleased with this pen. It is the smoothest writing fountain pen I have
ever used. I gave up on fountain pens long ago (20+ years) because they always
got ink on my fingers. Of course, I'll admit that I never had an expensive
fountain pen, just those cheap ones they sold everywhere, so I guess I got what
I deserved! The only drawback about the Safari is its looks. The body is
functional and will show you when you are running low on ink, but with the
ultra-large clip, it is frankly pretty ugly. But I guess there is less chance of
someone wanting to steal it."
auxetic,"June 13, 2011","Excellent pen, as many of the previous reviews have said. The ergo-grip is
double edged- some days I love it, some days I wish it was just cylindrical.
Another thing against the design is that the base unscrews very easily after a
period of use. That means that you might take it out of your pocket or whatever
and have to tighten the barrel assembly. Not a bad thing, just a little quirk
that no one has really mentioned. Oh and horrible nib creep. Overall a terrific
budget pen - although I actually prefer using my Kaweco Sport as a daily writer.

Lioo,"January 9, 2011","I just wrote with this pen for the very first time and i have to admit.......the
best fountain pen i have ever written with! this safari is GREAT! The moment i
inserted the ink cartridge 10 seconds later, i found myself writting on paper.
Not only was it perfectly smooth but also had the right kind of lightwieght
balance in my hand. I know some other reviews i read stated that it was
""SCRATCHY"" but not the one i got haha because it writes as smooth as a feather
(if that makes any sense lol).  I would really recommend this Lamy fountain pen to everyone. The Extra Fine Nib
is the way to go if you want an awesome writing experience although ive heard
there really isnt much defference between EF and F nibs. If you are doubting
whether to buy it or not--- don't because it's a no brainer, you got to have it
:)"
lksandrock,"January 7, 2011","This is my third fountain pen, I bought so that I would not have to worry about
my more expensive fountain pens disappearing off of my desk at school. I love
the extra fine nib. It works very well with all of my J. Herbin inks. A great
pen for beginners, as well as a good all-around inexpensive pen for everyday
use."
bsilver87,"December 2, 2010","This is the first fountain pen I ever bought, and for a beginner, it makes
writing much more enjoyable. The EF nib is a bit scratchy, I'd suggest swapping
for an F nib (I barely noticed a difference between the two, it's really
slight). Design-wise, it's a quirky-looking pen, I like it, but others may not.
The plastic is very durable, and the matte body is great since it wont really
show any scratches from wear. With the cap posted, it feels top-heavy or
unbalanced. Otherwise, it's super lightweight, and for me, reduces any stress on
my hand."
gunikpak,"September 30, 2010","Jetpens shipped this to me quickly! I love the Safari. The cartridge ink and extra-fine nib works well on my
Moleskine with no bleedthough, little echo, and no feathering. Sometimes I do
get these very strange feathers almost 2-3mm long, but that only happens once in
a while and you cant really tell when you're reading that it's there. The black
nib on charcoal black barrel is definitely a nice color scheme."
beavis_diablo,"August 21, 2010","This is the first fountain pen I bought from JetPens. I would have to say it is
a great value. The pen is well built and very rugged. I take it to school

use a large variety of FP inks. It really is well worth the money."
robert1978,"June 4, 2010","This was my first fountain pen and I absolutely love it. I use it with a

never let me down. Just an overall great pen."

with it and love the combination. Writes very smoothly with no breaks. Not sure
if I am lucky or others just unlucky."
cgoose86,"January 1, 2010","This is my first fountain pen and I'm enjoying it very much. I'm using it to ink
my drawings and so far it is doing a pretty good job. I'm using noodler's black
bulletproof and for the most part it works well. There is some slight problems
when I'm making fast strokes, the flow of the ink seems to slow down and then
the marks come out thin and scratchy, but I don't know if that's the pen or the
inks problem. Overall a great first pen imo. Cheers!"

smithl3257,"February 27, 2008","The Lamy pen writes a bit scratchy but it does not annoy me as it might some.
The ink however flows whenever I put pen to paper. It is a bit top heavy with
the cap, but overall it is a great pen to use everyday. I have about ten
fountain pens, most of them expensive and outside of the one's made by Pilot and
Pelikan this pen is more reliable than most of them. I am a student and this pen
is great for class and if I should misplace it, I won't die of heart failure."
bjhandeland,"July 1, 2013","The short story: I'm quite disappointed... The longer story: After reading a lot about how this pen is a ""classic"" among
rather cheap fountain pens, I decided to try one out for myself. Well, either I
got a dud, or the majority of other people who tried this pen are wrong.. which
is unlikely. Anyway, I'm using this pen with the Sailor Nano Black ink, which I
myself have no bad experience with. First of all, the pen is way broader than
any EF I've ever tried. I knew ""western"" made pens were wider, but I did not
expect this much wider. It puts down a line of about 0.8 -> 1.0mm. If it puts
down a line at all... When writing, the pen will skip almost every single time.
If I only lift the pen for a few seconds, when starting again it will skip. Apart from skipping, there's not very mich to pick at, really. The design is
sturdy, when the pen writes, it writes really smooth, the grip feels good, and
the overall appearance has a rugged and sturdy, but really nice feel about it. However, when a pen designed to write has trouble writing, it's not worth more
than 3 stars. Maybe it's the ink, and maybe I should try some different ones,
but this is my first impression. I'll update my review if the quality of the pen
changes whenever I change the ink."
geoff.hayton,"May 31, 2013","It appears I've received the only dud Safari in existence. It has to be an
outlier, because my pen's performance bears no resemblance to these glowing
reviews. I checked the nib--it does indeed have EF stamped on it, however the
line it produces is absolute garbage. I would put it at about 2mm on a Moleskine
page, with bleed, skips, feathering, and pools of ink all over the place. I've
tried it on four different kinds of paper, and the result is the same. I've had
crayons leave a finer line. I can't imagine how fast this thing shoots through
ink. Fortunately I'll never have to know, because I'm sending it back. I've used
Sailor pens until now, and it looks like I'll be using them in the future as
well."
jfeltracco1,"February 26, 2011","This pen is wonderful, from the high-quality plastic to the super smooth nib,
this thing has blown me away completely. This is a must buy for anyone looking
to switch to a fountain pen, but doesn't have very much money. Also shipping
from Jetpens was very fast and there were no issues at all. This was a great
first purchase and probably many more will ensue."
dammitclark,"October 10, 2015","First, I must admit that this is my first venture with a fountain pen. This
being said, I am no 'pro', nor 'aficionado'. I, simply, wanted to find a more
elegant way of writing and leaving my mark in the office because my new job
requires me to do a considerable amount of writing. That's right: writing, not
typing. So, I stumbled upon fountain pens after a quick search on the webs about
custom ink colors. The idea of a fountain pen was amazing, nay, IS amazing;
however, I have been THOROUGHLY disappointed. The pen worked well at first, then
would stop supplying ink to the tip. After multiple occasions of tapping on my
notepad and various documents like I was having a seizure, I decided that this
just was not worth having ink all over my fingers. Especially when your boss is
looking at you like you have male genitalia growing out of your forehead while
you are doing so. Keep in mind that this particular pen was my first fountain
pen. I am unsure that the malfunctions that I experienced were due to the
particular ink I was using, or, shady craftsmanship. Either way, don't buy this
pen."
rlebow9978,"March 6, 2015",an all time favorite pen...a classic
brenner,"July 28, 2009","This pen is a bit over-hyped IMO. It is a nice pen but far from perfect. It
feels great in my hand (very comfortable design) and refilling the ink is easy.
However I use Noodlers bulletproof black ink and I don't think it works very
well in this pen. The pen skips all the time which is a real problem when using
it to sketch with. I love the feel of the tip on the paper but because of the
skipping I have not been using this pen as much as I would like to."
dclutter1,"October 23, 2012","I ordered the Safari after using a Pilot Varsity for a few weeks and really
liking it.  According to all the reviews and information I found, it seemed like
the Safari was THE go-to fountain pen.  I agree with that assessment and I love
the pen so far.  However, I'm no expert on fountain pens so I won't even try to
detail the technical aspects of this pen.   What I do think I can add though, is some perspective on the nib size as
compared to the Pilot Varsity.  I looked around for a comparison before I
ordered and couldn't find one. I was unhappy with the medium nib - it pours ink onto the paper.  I've recently
been working on improving my penmanship and the ink flow was far to fast/thick
for me (likely because I'm writing slow and carefully).  The medium nib produces
a much wetter and somewhat wider line than the Varsity.   I was disappointed when I got the pen but I knew it was just a matter of
replacing the medium nib with a finer one.  But, how much finer?  Having two
options and not wanting to gamble again, I just ordered both the ""Fine"" and
""Extra Fine"" Lamy replacement nibs. I tried the extra fine nib first.  It definitely solved the problem of my
letters bleeding together but it produced a much more narrow line than I wanted.
 I noticed it being a very little bit scratchy, but still easy and comfortable
to write with; not quite what I was looking for though. Next, of course, I tried the ""Fine"" nib.  If you're familiar with the Pilot
Varsity and like the line size, flow, etc. than this is the one you want.  It's
a little bit dryer than the Varsity but still a nice, smooth, dark line."
mrsmackulics,"October 12, 2011","You can't beat a Lamy fountain pen.  It has the most comfortable grip for
calligraphy and every day writing.  If you use the converter, you never run out
of ink, but don't worry.  Using the cartridges is no problem because the ink in
them is every bit as black as your best fountain pen ink.  I was writing a check
out at a shop and the clerk noticed the pen.  He's a self professed pen-aholic
and couldn't take his eyes of it.  When I let him give it a spin, he immediately
asked for your web site.  In addition to the comfortable grip, multitude of
colors, you can buy one inexpensively or upgrade a little and they're still
reasonable. And I've had them for years and never has one leaked or spit on me. 
One of the best pens on the market for my money and my handwritng.

sportypebbles,"August 13, 2013","The pen is wonderful- I actually also bought the same pen with Fine nib for my
boyfriend- but the nib is terrible. There is something different about the
silver nib (came on my yellow Safari) and the black nib that comes with the
Carcoal body pen. It drags too smoothly (or so it feels) and doesnt let enough
ink out, resulting in slow starts and skipping while writing. Both the medium
and fine nibs have this problem, so its not exclusive to one pen, and the silver
nib I have does not have this problem no matter what ink I use. The Charcoal is a cool pen and it looks great, but the black nib is terrible."
sheldon.holland,"December 20, 2011","I bought this off a friend in the office who is a pen enthusiast like myself. I
had a handful of Preppy's, and a Pilot extra-fine fountain pen. I had read about
the Safari's on this site and was hoping to get an extra fine when they came
back in stock. I traded him a Pilot G2 with a Mont Blanc refill and some cash
for this pen, and I have to say this pen is by far my favourite of my
collection. I've been using it for school notes lately and the medium nib makes
it so smooth to write with, and doesn't bleed at all. I used up the cartridge
and loaded in the converter with J. Herbin Eclat de Saphir. and it's a machine.
No problems with it at all. Worth every penny in my opinion. "
Lufthansa138,"February 18, 2013","I want to start by saying that this is my ever fountain pen. I bought it because
I'm a college student and I wanted something a bit more substantial to take
notes with. This pen is everything they say and more! It is a great weight, but
made of incredibly durable plastic so I don't have to worry about it when I
throw it in my bag. The medium nib is not too thick. But it's definitely thicker
than the pilot gel pens if anyone is wondering. It's the perfect size for my
type of handwriting, although I noticed that my sister might benefit from a
finer point. I recently found out that you can use any type of Lamy nib, so I'll
probably buy a few more just to experiment. Its very smooth on paper, and
especially perfect for use on a moleskine notebook.  The ink cartridge was kinda crappy, the color dried very unevenly and was just
an unappealing color, but I bought the four dollar converter and diamine ink and
was much more pleased. I highly recomend purchasing the coverter, its simple to
use and more price friendly in the long run. "
wymont,"February 25, 2016","While I was researching different inks I noticed that a lot of people were
mentioning that they used this or that brand of ink in their Lamy Safari pen.  I
wondered why so many people were using such an inexpensive pen so I started
reading reviews of the Safari and was amazed that so many people loved the
smoothness of them and the overall reliability.  Curiosity got the best of me so
I ordered one with a medium nib.These pens have a well deserved reputation.  The one I received writes extremely
smoothly on any kind of paper I put in front of it.  It is as smooth as any of
my vintage pens and will probably see more use than they do.  The triangular
gripping section is just fine and actually forces me to hold the pen correctly. 
Count me in as a Lamy Safari fan."
dadicus,"February 27, 2015","If you're reading this review then you probably already know that Safaris are
bullet-proof pens.  I've had several and found them to be as reliable as pens
costing three or four times as much.  The maintenance is easy and
straightforward, and they come in a wide variety of colors.  This particular
pen, the charcoal black color, is made from a different kind of plastic than the
more colorful, smooth plastic versions.  This pen has a slightly lighter feel,
and bit more texture.  I like it because it's smart enough to wear with my
business suit, but is still an everyday writer.  The black clip and nib are also
super-cool, though I wound up removing the stock black nib and replacing it with
a 1.5mm chrome Lamy calligraphy nib.  I was sorry to lose the black nib, but
really love the line variation of the calligraphy nib."

the comfort of this Pen. I have big hands, and this Pen is quite nice to hold. The gripping of the Pen
feels natural. The heaviest part of this Pen would have to be the Clip. Within
30 minutes of use, I'm going to be making this Pen my Pen of choice from now
onwards. The last thing I should mention is also how JetPens did an outstanding job in
shipping. I live in Canada, and from the date of Purchase (Nov. 19th, 2012) the
Pen arrived in 9 days - not business, which includes weekends - which is
outstanding. If the shipping and handling for all of my future orders are

uncomfortable and places my hand in an awkward position. The medium nib writes
smoothly and the ink is flows well but for someone that writes small I would
suggest maybe starting with a fine nib. I think that this pen would be a great
start for a child but there are better options in my opinion for adults."

extremely difficult to clean.  The Lamy Safari is trouble free in comparison,
low maintenance and reliable."

light and while I know it isn't, if feels a little cheap and fragile. I prefer a
pen with a little more weight to it. But it still gets all 5 stars because the weight of the pen was an assumption
and not something I was falsely lead to believe. Its a lovely pen and worth
every penny, just be informed that it is rather light. "

:) Update: JetPens gets high marks for customer service.

It's impractical next to my cheap disposable office pen which writes in
permanent ink and also doesn't leak, but it's more fun to use.  The medium nib
writes a line larger than a 0.7 pen, which I like.   It writes closer to the
size of a ball point pen once the ink spreads on the paper.  Cool pen."

jworwood,"August 14, 2013","I love the Lamy I've got, and it's a very affordable and well-built writing
instrument.  The only thing I am not overly fond of with the Lamy Safari is the
shape of the pen where you hold it. If I'm just printing regularly or writing
numbers at work, it's just fine. However, I'm trying to learn Spencerian script
with the mott media workbooks, and it requires a different writing angle to work
comfortably.  If this pen had a round grip, I'd probably never buy another casual carry pen.
When I get better, I'll be using pens with a flex nib to do spencerian, but I'd
imagine that for anybody who writes cursive on a bit of an angle, you'd do well
to double check how you hold the pen and make sure this pen will be comfortable
for you.  The only reason I'm not giving this a 5-star is more of a user issue
than an issue with the actual product. I know a few people who don't find the
grip comfortable, but if you're just getting into fountain pens, I'd say it's
definitely one to try out."

Thucydides,"March 9, 2015","Love, Love, Love.Japanese fine-point pens will be the death of me, but it will be a beautiful
ending to my life. I first encountered the Pilot Juice series at work (I am an
instructor at a tutoring center), when our lovely boss gave us new correcting
pens. I fell in love with the neatness and super-fine points of these babies,
not to mention that they write wonderfully (no skipping!!!). They may use gel
ink, but the dry time is pretty fast given that they're extra fine; I've never
had any issues with smudging. If you are an artist, they're perfect for quick
sketches! The color also builds up, so you can create many layers of color with
just one pen. I ended up buying five of them from JetPens. Here's a tip for
purchasing some of your own:Individual pens and pen sets have the same price per pen. If you like to choose
your colors, I recommend picking your own favorites and just buying them
separately. If you like pen sets, then choose the pen sets. I personally only
chose the colors I really wanted at the beginning, but I will most likely buy
some more soon. Also, as I did buy individual pens, you'll see this review on a
select few colors on this site.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys fine-point pens."
johnsaa92,"September 27, 2014","I got this pen in a bunch of different colors.  I'm super particular about my
physics notes and have to write down a lot of equations and pictures so I wanted
a pen that was smooth but didn't smudge or bleed so that all of my notes were
very clear.  I have super small handwriting so I've had some issues finding the
right pen.  These pens are amazing. I have, however, had troubles with the
orange and green pens that I got.  For some reason they don't flow very well so
I can really only use them to draw lines and aren't very useful for taking notes
because the ink sort of skips in and out.  But these are the only colors I've
had trouble with.  Otherwise a very nice pen that results in elegant looking
handwriting."
banobana,"November 6, 2018","I've ordered this pen in 2014 and it's my favorite pen still. It's my everyday
pen and also used for all the writing in my art journal. I like how the grip is
close to the tip because I hold pens and pencils very close to it. I've seen the
hype for the .38mm Muji black pens before and bought them too off-site, but
found them uncomfortable in my grip. Therefore, I gave them away and went back
to the ol' Pilot Juice. It doesn't feather or bleed, and ghosting on the
opposite page is very, very minimal.The only bad thing about this pen is that it smears with sweaty fingers. Yes,
weird, I know, but I have people go through my journal sometimes, pointing at
certain spots I have written on or holding the page at a part that is
text-heavy, and afterwards I see that words have been SMEARED UGH. Out of habit
and as an artist, I myself am always careful not to put my hands all over or
directly on any art or handwriting, but of course, some people don't even think
of it. Until I find another pen that can survive uncultured swine-hands, I'm
sticking to this one for eternity."

technorae,"January 22, 2016",I LOVE Juice pens! This one does not disappoint.

Anonymous,"January 1, 2016",Great pen! Super fine line and smooth ink!
elmnt,"December 22, 2014","I've gone from Pilot G2 to Zebra Sarasa to the Pilot Juice. This is the gel ink
pen I've been looking for. I love the slim profile (unlike the fat, curvy grip
on the G2)."
caridge,"May 2, 2014","It was amazing at first, but then after about a month they started Dying... I'll
stick to My G-2 Limited."
bobp,"April 2, 2014","The Juice black pens in 0.38 and 0.5 sizes are my favorite pens! They don't cost much, flow smoothly, last a long time, and have never let me
down. My last order from JetPens was all Juiced up - with a couple of pen bodies and
lots of refills. I'm not much for the array of colors that the Juice has, but I'm all about the
black, blue and darker colors."
annie,"December 15, 2014","By far my favorite pen. super smooth! doesn't rip the paper, and doesn't bleed.
it is also super dark, and doesn't smear when highlighted over! "
Ajay,"November 26, 2020","I was super skeptical of gel pens because I never liked the PIlot G2s. Turns out
I probably didn't like them because they were too big for my liking (0.7mm).
And, let me say, this pen, at 0.38mm, totally changed my tune on gel pens. This
is one of the smoothest writing gel pens I've used for its smaller size. The ink
a deep black, and it draws a nice, uninterrupted line, no skipping at all. And
let me also just praise the clip on this pen. It opens ip pretty wide, which is
really great fo me because I have a bed pouch type thing that acts as my
nightstand. One part fits between the mattress and the box spring, and the
folder part of it hangs down, and I put a notebook and a pen in there. The pen
is perfect for that because the clip opens super easily and opens wide enough to
clip to the side of the thick felt fabric. I decided that would be my permanent
""nightstand"" pen, and went ahead and got another one for my pencil case! I
highly suggest giving this one a shot if you're on the fence. "
Pen Addict ,"June 10, 2018",Love this pen for work! 
Beemo,"June 5, 2018","Similar to the G2, but it is smoother which makes it better. I think the gel ink
lasts longer than the g2 also, and I love the .38mm point."
elle,"December 30, 2017",i really like this pen! it's dark and meets my standards. 
penreviews,"April 12, 2017","Great everyday pen. if you're a heavy writer, consider purchasing a backup pen
because the ink goes a bit fast. "
rboyz4,"December 25, 2015",Great pen!
akabose11,"November 29, 2013","This is a very nice, cheap, clicker pen. The ink is very vibrant and dark. I
think the color is comparable to the Uniball Signo, and the pen is also a smooth
writer. The clicker is a little resistant, more than the Zebra Sarasa, but
nowhere near the G2 clicker. It has a very large ink capacity as well."
bloop,"December 27, 2022","my favorite pilot pen, the ink is super nice and opaque. dries slow, though, be
careful when writing on waxy paper"
Beesy,"December 19, 2022","Feels very light and airy, but I still feel like I'm in control of the pen.
Slightly paler than the G-2, which I'm used to using. I love the spring clip."
cmu85ee,"December 15, 2022","I am a fan of black fine gel pens, and this is my favorite.  I strongly prefer
retractable pens, and these go everywhere with me.  The lines are dark and thin

babybluebottom,"November 14, 2022","Great pen. Actually fine point if that's what you're after. So far smooth and no
skipping."
kurikutenshi,"August 28, 2022","This has been one of my go to pen for years. It writes very smoothly and I like
how pigmented the black is."
jensen.s.3D,"June 5, 2022","This is an excellent pen at a reasonable price point. I like that it comes in a
variety of colors to help me color code my writing when the notes are dense. I'm
a lateral gripper and while this pen's grip is thin, as long as I don't apply
too much pressure, it is still comfortable to hold."

Jane,"November 14, 2020","After searching for a long time, I think I’ve finally found my favorite pen!
The ink is incredibly smooth, and since I got the 0.38 mm, there’s just that
slight resistance that makes it easy for me to write quickly but not too
messily."
willblr,"October 30, 2020","Clip is actually very useful. Writing is a little scratchier than I would like,
but not too bad for a 0.38. This is not the best 0.38mm black pen, but
considering that it is cheaper than many of the comparable products and has a
unique feature, it is a good value for the price. "

crystallinequartz,"August 26, 2020","this isn't my go to pen. the pen body is too thin for me, and i don't like how
the grip looks. i will say that the springyness of the clip is good though. i
feel like the pen is scratchy at times, especially compared to similar size pen
tips from zebra sarasa, pilot g-2, and pentel energel. it still is miles above
ballpoint pens and cheap gel pens, but i mean you're already on jetpens, so just
save 5 cents and grab a zebra sarasa or something"

kelley.scharf,"July 30, 2020","Only pens I use now. Have turned on numerous people to these pens. I write very
small and the point allows for clear writing. No more blending like a typical

Rebecca,"July 6, 2020","I always recommend the Pilot Juice to any die-hard users of the more popularized
Pilot G2 retractable pen. I find them very comparable; however, I do recommend
the Juice slightly more. I think it works out some ink inconsistencies in the G2
beautifully, and still remains in the same central price range. A great,
reliable pen!"
nrohallandrade,"June 10, 2020",Amazing!! Writes so smooth!!
SandwichCucumber1210,"June 10, 2020","Very pigmented, smooth, fast-drying pen!! I would pick this over a G-2 or Zebra

hoangnhu.20040,"June 2, 2020",This one is also a color from the Pilot Juice Pen packs n it writes smoothly :)
Carla,"June 1, 2020","It was all right. That is all I can say. Yes it was smooth, but I've found smoother. This is a good pen to have lying around the house though. Don't like the mechanisms of the pen itself, too much wiggling around in there. "
ts12072002,"June 1, 2020","As a leftie, this pen has the perfect tip size to handle my small writing, and
it feels smooth to write with too! I bought three so I don't have to worry about
running out of pens anytime soon, and all came in perfect and brand new
condition! The ink takes pretty much exactly 3 seconds to dry, so be cautious if
you're a leftie that writes quickly and is prone to constantly smearing your
writing! "
lnerro4,"May 12, 2020","I am a pilot gel pen user. This is the first time I purchased the Pilot Juice.
It is a fine line gel pen which I love. No shadowing in my bullet journal and no
bled through. Writing is smooth and effortless. I will be purchasing more colors. The ink did blur when I used a highlighter,
but maybe I did not wait long enough for the gel ink to dry."
ad900,"April 30, 2020","I love this pen so much, it's the only one I use. The ink flows smoothly, it
writes beautifully. Not so thin that it's scratchy, but still thin enough that
my writing doesn't look like a blobby mess. "
intoteacups,"March 17, 2020","I bought this pen to test it against the Pilot G2 0.38mm, as I heard it was
better. So far what I've noticed is that, in terms of comfort, the grip is about
the same but the barrel is thinner. Both pens are fairly scratchy, but the Juice
does seem to be smoother. It could just be my lighting, but the ink also looks a
bit darker, as well. I also find I have a tad bit more control with the Juice, I
think due to the slightly smoother ink flow.I'd have to use this pen a bit more but so far it definitely feels like an
upgrade from the G2. "
yssasaba03,"March 11, 2020","They’re great pens! I highly recommend getting them. They’re worth more than
their price"
franchescaqromero,"February 22, 2020","I give this four stars because I really like the flow of the pen and the size of
the pen is really small and it works well with writing in small areas. The only
con is that it takes a while to dry so I suggest to let it dry a couple seconds
before running your hand through the paper"
taylorbenson2002,"February 3, 2020",the pen wasn’t low on ink but stopped writing normally.

carmasquirrel,"October 15, 2019","I absolutely love this pen, and now that I've got my own I understand why it's
so popular. The pen is easy to write with and smooth, with a very fine click
action. Definitely a new favorite!"
caesar.stephen,"October 14, 2019","Writes well, very good color. Looks cheap though, but then again, it's a great
price. A little scratchy compared to some other pens too. You can get better for
a dollar or two more, but if you're buying in bulk and want to save this is the
way to go."
Vicky,"October 11, 2019","I thought the Pilot G-2 pens (which are more readily available) were great. Now
that I've used a Pilot Juicy, I don't think I can go back. Smoothest writing out
of any gel pen I've ever used."
Aivey,"September 16, 2019","I can easily say that I am a gel pen enthusiast! I have tried so many different
types of gel pens but this has to be the best one yet! I have very small
handwriting so the fine point on these is perfect for me. The ink glides so
smoothly across paper unlike typical, scratchy fine point pens and the body is
comfortable enough to hold for extended amounts of time. The only issue I've had
with these is smearing when trying to highlight right after writing. However,
this isn't a big problem at all if you let the ink fully dry first. This is the
only pen I have been using and the only pen I plan on using for a while.
Definitely will be stocking up on these!"
hill33c,"September 10, 2019","I bought this along with the Zebra Sarasa Push Clip Gel 0.4mm Black, and they
are both great pens, but I have to give the edge to the Pilot Juice. It has a
bit more smoothness while writing. Will be buying refills for this great pen. "
Aida.Jabiullah,"August 20, 2019",This writes so smoothly I got addicted to using it. Balloons pens who? 
TortoiseshellJen,"August 12, 2019","Of all the pens I've tried, this is my favourite. I'm in the UK and it works
well on both Pukka Pad and Oxford paper. I've tried the G-Tec C4, but found the
inkflow somewhat unreliable and the tip too fragile. I've tried the Uniball
Signo DX 0.38, but found that the ink sometimes collects at the tip,
occasionally leaving blobs of ink on the paper, and I've found the the Zebra
Sarasa pens too scratchy.The Pilot Juice doesn't seem to have any of these issues. It feels like it could
write the entire JetPens website without stopping or being inconsistent with ink
flow, and still feeling just as smooth.I also ordered some of the Pilot Juice 0.5mm and it's basically the same pen
with a slightly thicker line. Will definitely buy again as and when I need them."
reasey-h,"July 26, 2019",writes smoothly and small-y
victoriamia99,"July 24, 2019","This pen has got to be one of my favorite go-to pens for anything! Especially
taking notes. I chose the 0.38 size because I prefer smaller sized tips and I
was not disappointed. The ink flow on this pen is incredible! It is a true jet
black, and the ink is so juicy. There is zero skipping with the ink when
writing, though the body does rattle. I personally don't mind the rattling when
I write, it is not too noticeable."
tjr_shop,"July 21, 2019","If you are looking for a pen that has a fine point and is smooth.  I would
recommend this one.  It is well balanced, light and the clip is spring loaded
making it easy to put in a pocket or pen holder in your bag.I would give it a 5 star but when I pick it up it doesn't give me urge to write
or draw with it.  I will keep on my desk for the ""oh crap"" I need a pen moments.
 But it isn't something I will carry around all the time."

it a try."

retractable as I am famous for losing pen caps!  The drawback is the lack of

Once I started using them, I can no longer use any generic pen. The ink is very
smooth and looks lovely on paper. I ordered many of these pens in various colors
and have not been disappointed. Some of the light blues are very light so they
would not be optimal for writing something lengthy. I placed my order on a late
Friday and by Saturday, I received an email saying that my order had already
been shipped. I received the pens on Monday! "

Ben the CSI Guy,"July 1, 2016","Pilot Juice Gel Pens are one of the top pens out there, especially in a .38 mm
point.  I would suggest this one to anyone, best part about this one is the fact
that it does retract.  And the clip is spring assisted, which is even more nice!
 I give this pen, 9.5/10.  -- I dropped this pen once with the tip still out,
the tip hit the ground and it didn't write as smooth anymore.  I know this is
""user error"" but just a caution, don't drop the pen."

georgia,"August 18, 2015","0.38 mm just isn't for me because the narrowness of this tip makes it feel like
it's digging into the paper. That being said, though, this is actually a pretty
nice pen. The line is lovely, the ink is a great shade of black, but it's just
too thin for me. If you like 0.38, I don't know why you wouldn't like the way
this one writes! My only real complaint is the pen is a tad too light for my
taste. "

chirmer,"June 22, 2015","These are, hands down, the blackest pens I have ever written with. I admit, I
haven't tried many pens outside what you can pick up at a generic store like
Staples or Office Depot, and only have one fountain pen ink so far (Noodler's
black), but it's way, way deeper than anything I've ever owned. The pigment in
the gel makes the pen write almost like a hybrid gel/liquid pen. It begins
writing as soon as it touches the paper - you don't even have to move the pen,
contact alone starts the ink flowing. The grip is incredibly comfortable, and
the pen's width perfect for my smaller hands. The clip is also AMAZING. Strong
grip, quality spring, thick plastic. It would take some serious effort to break
it. I clip it on my Traveler's notebook and my pants pocket, and it's never
fallen off of either.Definitely my new favorite black everyday pen."

find the volume of this pen downright offensive.  Positively hideous."
Shamalama Dingdong,"October 13, 2013","So after reading many blog posts stating that Jetstream pens were so good, I
finally ordered one. I didn't have high expectations, since my taste in pens
seems to be uncommon: I do not press hard and write pretty small, so I like fine
point pens with minimal ink flow, yet they absolutely must not skip. I used to
use roller ball pens before going to Japan in the late 1990s and discovering
Hi-Tec-C 0.4 pens, which quickly became my favorite. I tried my share of
expensive pens of all kinds, but found that they intimidate me and make me
uncomfortable. Besides, fountain pens (though they might be fun to play with)
are too high-maintenance for me. Well, after writing a few words with my new Jetstream Sport 0.7, it was clear
that this is a serious contender for the title of best pen ever. For the first
time since the 1990s, the Hi-Tec-C meets a worthy challenger. Smooth, dark
lines, absolutely no skipping, and quick drying. One advantage it has over the
Hi-Tec-C is that its point is not as fragile. I'm not afraid of dropping it or
lending it to a friend.  I don't really understand the ""0.7"" rating of this pen, it writes a finer line
than many 0.5 pens, and seems to be on par with a Hi-Tec-C 0.4."
dandender,"July 21, 2012","I absolutely love the Jetstream line of pens! I was introduced to Jetstream
after picking up a promotional pen at a scientific conference. I was immediately
impressed with how smoothly it wrote, and how dark the resulting line was. You
get used to how nicely these write, but then if you switch to another pen you
can immediately see how much fainter other pens are. These pens always write,
down to the last drop of ink. After using the promotional pen for a while I was
so impressed, I went online to find the exact pen and that's how I found
Jetpens! The Jetstream Basic Series are my favorites for everyday writing. The rubber
grip is on the hard side but comfortable, and the size is just right for me. I
use this pen, and the red pen for corrections, on a daily basis. In fact, I
bought a whole bunch of them in black, blue and red and gave them out to my
family so that they could try them out as well. A quick note to anybody that may experience skipping. If you write on
plasticized paper at some point, I believe that this can gum up the small ball
at the end of the pen. I had this happen once, and had to switched in a new
refill because the pen became unreliable."
Carter,"January 6, 2016","I seriously can't believe this is a ballpoint pen. I HATE ballpoint pens and
have been looking for a replacement for ages. This pen writes like a 0.7mm gel
pen in terms of smoothness, but the line is thin and crisp like a 0.5mm gel pen.
If I could, I would buy it in lots of colors. "

bought this pen on a whim curious and looking for some other pens so that way I
can experiment around. I got this in my last order and I am genuinely impressed.
It's a pen I don't have to think about, it just writes and feels very
friction-less. I'm planning on buying a few more in my next order as this is
going to be my notes taking pens. I'll still keep my g-2's around though. For
they supplement my only complaint about these pens, that they're only offered in
3 colours."
xieniii,"May 12, 2009","Sanford/Uni-ball's Jetstream series pens are THE BEST pens I have ever written
with. EVER. I had been searching YEARS for the perfect pen (since high school)
and even went to Japan to find one (well, I was there visiting friends but
still, I spent many hours in Tokyo stores testing pens!). At first the Pilot
Hi-Tec-C pens filled the void, but only because their points were smaller than
.5 mm and I had never seen that in the States. I have small handwriting and like
my pen-strokes neat and cute. Then a few months ago I came across a Jetstream
pen and it was like wow, where have you been all my life. The ink is absolutely
smooth and doesn't smudge or soak into the fibers of the paper. In fact it
almost seems to hug the paper. The Jetstream series is categorized as ballpoint
but really it should be in the gel ink category. It is almost like gel ink
version 2.0.  The Pilot G-2 pens are absolutely archaic next to Jetstream. Signo, Sanford's
other pen series, are good but not quite perfect. I have been using a Jetstream
pen for four straight months now (I seriously do not even touch other pens) and
will never go back to regular ballpoint or all those other supposedly
smooth-writing gel pens. And forget about fine point fountain ink pens -- they
are just ghastly to write with, especially if you're like me and hate when ink
shows up on the back side of the paper when you're trying to write double-sided
notes. A professor once borrowed my Jetstream and forgot to return it, and I went to
great lengths to get it back. This pen is that good."
ryan,"July 28, 2010","This is a wonderful pen! I have used the 0.5mm, 0.7mm and 1.0mm versions - they
are all truly excellent. The ink never balls up for me - ink always flows
smoothly and evenly - and it dries almost instantly (this is important for
lefties).  I've bought a gang of these pens for my coworkers - they all love their pens and
thanked me for the gift. I see them all using them now too. ^_^"
alexanderlee1,"February 12, 2009","This pen has dethroned the gel ink Pilot G2 as my favorite pen as it doesn't

lpmusicmanlp,"July 28, 2010","Excellent pen for only $2.25. I'd definitely pick one up if you're ordering from
this site and haven't tried one before. One point of preference I'd like to add:
I tried the blue jetstream ink in my 'Style Fit' and it looks nicer than black,
in my opinion. That's probably just my taste, though. Either way, you won't go
wrong with this one."
Fred3426,"May 3, 2010","This is one pen you absolutely cannot go wrong with.The body looks great, and is incredibly lightweight, a definite selling point if
you're like me and tend to stay away from heavier pens. The grip is stiff but

GREAT without that gross feeling waxy paper and expensive ink pens. This pen
will JUST fit in the passport case and definitely in the regular sized one. "
jilleduffy,"July 13, 2022","Maybe I got a dud, but the ink jams up on this pen after half a line of writing.
It doesn't write at all if I position the pen perpendicular to the page, and my
handwriting and pen grip tends to be this way. It doesn't write on paper if my
hand has smudged even the lightest bit of lotion onto the page. I like that it's
lightweight, but I don't like that the grip area has stiff nubs that dig into
the sides of my fingers. The click is satisfying, the upper barrel has a nice
design. I only wish this pen would actually write."
musicmaniac1328,"April 4, 2022","The ink is wonderful. I definitely enjoy the jetstream refill. The body of this
pen os where I have issues. The clip digs into my hand. (I have small/medium

preferable for me. "
colleenspogue,"February 17, 2022","This is my absolute favorite pen of all time. I write with it every day taking
notes in college, and it writes so incredibly smoothly, and with the finest line
of any pen that smooth I've ever seen. It doesn't bleed out on the page at all,
it only shows through the page a tiny amount on cheap looseleaf, so you can
still write on both sides of the page. Bonus! it feels very comfortable in your
hand.10/10, I recommend this so highly"

is the Uni Jetstream Sport Ballpoint Pen. I liked some of the others better but
they each gave it up most within 1 yr or less. I use this uni jetstream pen
every day and have for a long time though I dont write a lot. Maybe that
explains why it has lasted this long? When this pen bites the dust I will order
a much nicer version. Probably order the Uni Jetstream Stylus Ballpoint Silver
Pen. Or maybe I'll just make one and use the cheap Uni Jetstream Sport Ballpoint
Pen for the insert. I see a lot of dissatisfaction with the refills for this pen

refills."

lewis,"February 6, 2020","What can I say: a great ballpoint.  The smoothest running and darkest writing
ballpoint there is.  Period.  I experience occasional blobbing when marking very
long lines, say for underlining.  The blobs are't large relative to the line
width and due dry, though more slowly than normal writing. This is not so much a
ding on Jetstream; it's a problem with all ballpoints (well, nearly all I've
experienced) and less with Jetstream than most others. A few Cross look-alike
refills are as smooth, but not as dark.  If there is any problem here it's that
the pen glides so rapidly that it is can be hard to keep your hand-writing neat.
 So, hold gently and write calmly."

ballpoint? Not sure on that one. I have gone through thousands of different pens
from everywhere I could, and For everyday use I would put this in the top    2

jamm,"March 7, 2016","Love this pen, but I prefer the other 0.7 Jetstream body types. This body is on
the cheaper side, however, it does have a nice rubberized grip area and it does
exactly what it is supposed to do. I'll still give it 5 stars. I am a big fan of
Jetstream 0.7mm. This is just one variation of the many options, which are
pretty much all superb pens. The slightly more expensive rubber body series, for
example, has a superior body and build IMO, but costs more of course. Both are
great pens."
NateTheScribbler,"February 29, 2016","These are great writing pens with a nice crisp smooth line and good ink color. 
If you need a cheap toss around pen that your not afraid to loose, break or loan
out, this could be it.  The body is really light weight and the clicker rattles
a bunch, but I kind of expect that from pens this affordable.  I really
preferred the same ink refills in the rubber bodied models.  Those are much
nicer to write with for extended periods.  If you just need a cheap pen, with
good fast drying ink, that's easy to write with, this is it.  I had much less
trouble with smearing than I do with the G2's and the ink is not quite as wet as
the EnerGels.  The 0.7mm writes much more like a 0.5mm in other brand refills as
well.  Great for smaller rulled notebooks."

coming back for refills at this point. "

sygyzy,"November 15, 2010","If you are going to get a Jetstream, the 0.7 mm size is the best IMO. These pens
tend to be sharper/scratchier than other ballpoints, perhaps because they are
not using a specialized smooth ink like the Vicuna or Surari. I actually don't
know why they have such a following. They are good pens but you can do better."
mshen06,"October 5, 2010","All the jetstreams I have bought tend to get clogged up after just a couple of
hours of use, even though there is a still a full tube of ink left in them. The
ink just ceases to come out, and it never returns to normal! I've had to throw
away so many jetstreams because of this problem. Anyone else experience this?"
fstgeorge,"May 21, 2010","I was really curious about a pen that is a ballpoint, but also supposedly
doesn't write like a ballpoint normally does. The construction of the pen is
fantastic, and the ink is more fluid than an average ballpoint(as in it starts
to write fast), but it also globs and streaks onto the paper at times like other
ballpoint pens. I'm not a fan personally."

jrkoop,"August 12, 2017","In Feb I purchased a TWSBI ECO Clear Fountain Pen with Fine Nib from JetPens

replaced my $300 Pilot 823 and $400 Omas Arte Italiana with custom Binder nib as
my every day writer, which is saying a lot."
natalia.c.may,"April 8, 2019","This pen is easy to write with and the body is just wide enough for a
comfortable grip without needing any indentations in the body or rubber grips. I
particularly enjoy being able to see the ink inside the body of the pen clearly,
being a demonstrator pen.I did have some troubles with ink flow after cleaning the pen for the first time
- the pen had slow starts and burps, but this hasn't happened since.As a side note, if you do take the pen apart and attempt to reassemble it, make
sure you wind the piston holding mechanism down a few turns before completely
assembling the pen - the pen won't be able to post otherwise as the bit that
turns at the top won't be flush with the rest of the pen."
ashunpiker,"February 11, 2018","I love this pen. It writes/draws really nicely. Perfect from the first stroke. I
use it for sketching. The features that are the most loved are the fact I can
just fill it straight from the bottle and - that I can always see how much ink I
have at all times. It has a little tool kit for fixing problems by yourself. I
have not had to use that yet.It is a wonderful tool, it has a nice pocket clip, a comfortable and sturdy 
feel overall.I plan to order the extra fine tip soon.I use it with the Black Platinum Carbon Ink - it is waterproof and a nice dark
black."
wliaw,"December 27, 2018","I recently rediscovered fountain fens after a long hiatus (20+ years).  I
stumbled upon this pen on the Jet Pens web site, really liked the reviews and
the aesthetics of the pen, bought the fine-nibbed version, and filled it with
Waterman Serenity Blue (my last fountain pen was a Waterman, so hence the
nostalgia.)  I've been loving the combination!  The pen has never skipped, and
the output has been consistent and reliable, not to mention beautiful.  It
writes clean and crisp on Rhodia paper, but also does fine (with an acceptable
degree of feathering) on regular Staples copy paper, which I use at work to take
notes.  Filling the pen was a breeze.  The large ink reservoir/ barrel is
mesmerizing, as I love to slosh the ink back and forth and watch the level go
down, eagerly waiting for the next fill of ink.  Disassembling the pen was
straightforward, thanks to the very helpful video on the Jet Pens web site. 
Loved the pen so much that I just bought my brother-in-law the exact same one. 
Thanks, Jet Pens!"
andrew.qian24,"August 4, 2017","You definitely get more then you pay for,this pen is perfect for anyone starting
out in a fountain pen and wants one without having to fill it up almost everyday
because of large amounts of writing. This pen is quite a gusher even though it
is a fine. Smooth writing and comfortable, Great for students that prefer
fountain pens. Good buy "
brennen,"May 5, 2021","This is a very well-designed product in almost every respect.  It's visually
appealing and a pleasure to write with, it's easy to fill, you can tell how much
ink is left, the reservoir is big, it seems unlikely to leak in a bag and
doesn't dry out.Unfortunately, after about 9 months of intermittent use I started to notice
cracks on the barrel of mine, at the feed/tip end, and not long after that it
started to leak ink steadily into the cap & on my hands when writing.Some searching around on reddit and fountain pen forums indicates that this is a
common failure mode for this model, so I'm not bothering to seek a replacement
part.  I also have TWSBI's Diamond 580, which has a metal ring / insert at that
end of the barrel, so I'm guessing it's less likely to break in this specific
way, though I have to say I otherwise like the fit/feel of this one better.I can't complain too much - for the price I probably got my money's worth, but
it's a shame since this is exactly the kind of fountain pen that would make a
perfect low-stakes introductory gift for the curious."

find something doesn’t make sense to me. About last year I bought TWSBI ECO
Green Extra Fine nib from jetpens. I felt like its nib didn’t give an extra
fine line. It’s more like a medium nib…. and then last week I just bought
this pen which is same brand, same series but in “Fine” nib. It should be
bigger than the extra fine nib that I have already had, right? but … no! It
gives thinner lines than the extra fine one even an ink that I put in the fine
nib one is more wet than the ink that I put in the extra fine nib one. "
JuliS,"October 9, 2022","I had a platinum preppy and I almost gave up on fountain pens because it was a

ink, but this really writes more like a medium & I wish I had ordered an extra

Japanese secretly put in their product something entangible that you don't see

in your life. This pen comes in my life in this manner- by conquering the
lightest side of my heart- my soft spot for art in any form. I 've chosen this
pen as a ""Beginner"" level. I read carefully and with appreciation the info collected and
offered to me so I don't feel lost choosing my tool. What I received wasn't
exactly a tool- it is a piece of art itself. Everything is included- my pen
comes with a box, special tools that I eventually may need to maintain its
perfection, instructions and, most importantly, it came full of this Japanese

together correctly. There’s a couple videos on YT that are extremely helpful,
if you do not follow the directions exactlyThe end cap will come off when you twist and it’s just frustrating. With all

bluenightpress,"November 11, 2010","I LOVE this pen, and all the DX UM-151s. I teach at the U of Utah, and this is
the pen I use to grade all of my student's papers. The tip is fine enough that I
can make little corrections in the margins and between lines; the ""Bordeaux
Black"" color is red enough to seem like it's chastising my students for their
silly mistakes, but not so red that they feel violated (turns out that bright
red pens have a negative effect on students); and the smoothness is unlike any
other pen with a tip this fine. The ""blotchiness"" that another reviewer
mentioned is, for me, more like a fountain pen's ""flair"" once you get more used
to it (perfect for writing kanji). Finally, one of the greatest features about
this gel pen compared to every other gel pen I've used is the speed at which it
dries--it's a smooth, fine gel ink that won't smudge. Awesome, awesome pen. Also
great for writing in the margins of books."
sumserfield,"January 6, 2017","This is less an ""off-black with a hint of red"" and more of a ""berry"" colour.
It's a pretty, but not what I was expecting at all from the description and
colour sample online.  It writes smoothly half the time. The other half is a scratchy struggle where
the pen doesn't seem to want to write. I'm not sure if I just somehow got a dud
in the manufacturing line, or if they are all like this. I've never had problems
with Uni-ball before, and honestly they normally write like a dream. Maybe next
time will be better with a different colour to boot."
Hemlock,"September 18, 2016","Foremost, I love the writing point of this pen. It is not too thick or thin. I
write a large portion of the day, and in cursive. This pen handles really well.
The cons to this pen are the color and ink flow. Bordeaux black is just dark purple. I was hoping for something similar to
Noodler's Red Black or Diamine's Oxblood in color, but maybe with a slightly
cooler tone. Nope, it's just purple. It's a nice pen.....but I not as deep of a
color as I hoped for.My other complaint is on the ink flow. Occasionally when I take breaks in
between writing a large ball of ink pulls at the tip. This results in a huge
puddle of ink the next time I touch tip to paper. Not a big deal, but just
irritating enough. I could have gotten the fluke. I have this pen in black and it's my go to pen (no problems there)My advice is to test out a ""plain"" version (i,e: black, blue, red) of this pen
before experimenting with the fancy colors."

is very sturdy yet delicate. I love the feel of this pen. Good weight--not too
heavy nor too light--and the plastic barrel fits my grip rather well. It is a
delight to write with and I LOVE the bordeaux black color, in fact it might be
my favorite color at the moment. My one complaint, and it is very annoying, is
that the ink frequently runs dry and I need to scribble on scrap paper to get it
going again. This is the one reason why this pen hasn't surpassed my other two
favorites: the Hi-Tec C and the Slicci 0.4 pens. "
helen.stavrou,"October 20, 2015","The pen leaks ink, which gets on my hands.  Am I doing something wrong?"
tamilee,"October 23, 2014","I am completely in love with this pen. The color is very nice and crisp, but
also really classy. The BEST color to edit or grade papers/tests/homework with.
It stands out really well from the paper, no student you grade will have this
same color to try and change your grade markings and it is not nearly as
aggressive as a bright red. I personally have always hated having my work
corrected in bright red- it's both demoralizing as well as an eyesore. The ink
is extremely smooth and you can write very quickly with this pen, however it is
not nearly as fine as other 0.38 mm pens I've used (such as the uni style fits)
and it feels a little more clunky than I was expecting. Almost as if the
thickness isn't very consistent, but I prefer that to a pen that often skips.
Dries quickly and have had no problems with smearing. Wish they made it in 0.28
mm."
romevi86,"April 30, 2014","This is my go-to correction pen. I like to type stories, but when I edit them I
opt for printing out the whole document and writing corrections/edits by hand.
This pen is perfect. It’s small enough for me to get into the tiny margins,
but bold enough for me to write without it feeling scratchy. I love the pen so
much I had to order the full color range!  As for this particular color, what I like about it is that it’s a great option
against red. Red is a bold color to use for correction, as it stands easily out
from among the text. But no one likes seeing red on their own paper—even me.
It’s darker than red, a more darker purple of color, but not enough of the
royal hue to make one think that it’s violet. Overall, this is probably my
most favorite correction pen and color combination."
janetburnham55,"January 22, 2020","Pens are perfect.  Smooth lines.  Consistent flow of ink. Not blotchy nor
smudges. Comfortable in my hand for writing. Beautiful color.  Could not ask for
a better pen. "
mericat,"January 2, 2020","This is a fantastic burgundy, very dark, great writing pen."
Novelidea,"September 26, 2019","I really like this color. If you want a red that's not a traditional red, get
the Signo Bordeaux Black. It's not a loud red color so it's actually quite nice
to take notes with. You can still add important stuff in a traditional red and
it will stand out against the Bordeaux Black."
daryl.boman,"August 18, 2019","Love the color for sketching and writing. Use this everywhere, class, work,
school and it never fails. Just don't loan it to a friend because you will never
get it back!"
mishafan03,"March 10, 2019","Love the pen and love the color. It's perfect for note taking in my classes. I'm
no longer worried about smearing when I close my notebook. The color is
beautiful and just what I had hoped for. Enough red to feel red but tempered
with black. It does make a scratching noise against my notebook paper but I
honestly love it. It makes me think of what it would sound like to write with a
quill (but much less loud). I didn't notice the scratching making the ink skip
or drag. It was just a nice asmr sound for me.The only negative was the amount of ink. I've been taking notes for a
certification for about a month (which is all I've used it for) and my pen has
about another week of ink in it at max. So I guess I just wish I'd bought a few
more of these, but it came in a five pack with a few other colors, so I will try
those next, but I will definitely be getting more of these."
andre,"September 4, 2018","I have ordered in total of 5x UNI UM151.60 pens (Bordeaux Black) on few separate
occasions over a year, and all 5 had the same issue with the ink flow. Ball tip is good, paper is clean and fresh, yet the pen does not write. I would
go over few different techniques to make it write, but it would not write at
all, and then all of the sudden it would. Later on it would stop again, then
resume again. I have tried 6 different colors from this series, this is the only one that does
this. Other than that, this is a beautiful color, it is exactly as the color of the on
the outside of the pen, and 100% matches the description in pictures. I just
wish it would be more reliable. Would give 5 stars, but having a pen that does not write when needed is just as
good as not having a pen at all. I hope this is just a bad batch though."
randallkharris,"February 15, 2013","This is a wonderful pen.  It's a little more fine point than I normally use, but
still easy to write with in those spots where you need a very fine line.  Ink
flow is perfect, in spite of the fine point.  The ink color, which is a perfect
mix of red and black, was a revelation to me.  It's a subtle color, very
pleasing to the eyes.  The pen is well made also, and feels good in the hand. 
Well worth the money!"

angelplay2,"May 24, 2012","A terrific color that is truly versatile -- simultaneously professional and fun.
I use for taking minutes, editing, as well as for spicing up a party invitation

break!"
schiang68,"April 23, 2012","This pen could be my new favorite.  It's comfortable to hold and writes
extremely smoothly, and the ink is a beautiful, unusual, but dignified burgundy
color (I mean, bordeaux!).  I just wish there were refills available!"
azizah.asgarali,"April 7, 2012","I love these pens - but this is one of my favorite colors. Not quite black, not
quite red - it's a good in between but still professional enough to use at
work/school. It’s very comfortable to hold and didn’t strain my hand after
extensive writing. I wish the grip was a little longer, and extended to the end
of the barrel because I grip my pen quite low, but I can manage. A sturdy, well
built nib that is still surprisingly smooth and not at all scratchy. The ink
dries very quickly so very low risk of smearing! Overall, I am a big fan of the
Uni-ball Signo DX line. "
nicw99,"January 5, 2012","This pen is fabulous! I love the fine line and I don't have problems with
skipping or smudging. The color is a pretty and vivid burgundy. It is a breeze
to write with. The pen is the perfect weight, and the rubber grip makes it
comfortable to write with. I wrote a thank you note with this pen and the
recipient liked the ink and line so much, that she asked where she could buy the
pen (I told her JetPens.com, of course!). My 9 year old son loves the pen too;
he wants one of his own. I recommend this pen if you like a fine line and a
vivid, unique color. I will purchase this pen again, for my son, my friends and
myself."
linzalvin16,"November 29, 2011","Love this color.  I'm not a fan of 0.38 tip because I find it too fine for me. 
However, this color is not available with 0.5 tip, so I tried it. I'm amazed to
discover that it's not as fine as what I thought.  The tip works perfect for me."
joe_hh,"September 28, 2010","Overall, probably the best red-black gel pen on this site as of now. A little
blotchy, and a little more purplish than red, but overall, a solid, comfortable
performer. My main go-to pen for black-red."

mrader3,"April 3, 2022","I ordered four different colors, and most of them write pretty well. But some of

a try. "

Francesca,"February 4, 2021","I originally bought this off black colour along with two other off black
colours—Brown Black and Lavender Black—because of all the hype, the ooh, ah,
wow, surrounding these colours. Well…all these colours are richly pigmented
and vibrant. The ink is dark, but its base is clearly visible. The Bordeaux
Black is similar to the Pilot Juice Dark Red and Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel Vintage
Bordeaux Purple. The Brown Black is similar to the Pilot Juice Coffee Brown and
Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel Vintage Sepia Black. I have no other colour similar to the
Lavender Black. After trying these colours, I realized that one of each wasn’t
enough, so I bought more. The cap is easy to remove and snaps in place
satisfyingly. The cap can also be posted securely as there is a groove at the
end of the barrel for that purpose. The rubber grip is comfortable, and my
fingers don’t slide beyond it. All these three pens are very inky and none are
scratchy."

Clifton R,"October 23, 2020","The Uniball Signo DX 0.38 (aka Signo UM-151) turned out to be one of my favorite
pens out of about 12 different models of gel and rollerball pen I tried out in
this order, and I find myself using one or another of these the most so far of
this batch of new pens, or perhaps second after the Platinum Preppy fountain
pen.The ""Bordeaux Black"", essentially a very dark maroon, is a particularly nice
color, either for writing blocks of text or for adding comments & insertions,
accenting them so they stand out from black text. I'm using it more for writing
than drawing, but it would be a very nice pen for drawing too."
brendan.brinton99,"October 21, 2020","I generally prefer click pens so it was a bit of a departure from my norm to buy
a stick pen. I dont regret it at all. The signo UM-151 is a treat to write with;
the tip is the slightest bit scratchy, a feature I very much enjoy, the pen is
also very light so its nice for marathon sessions. The Bordeaux Black is also a
beautiful color, a dark, rich red wine color, hence the Bordeaux. Highly
recommend"
Zhane,"October 14, 2020","Deep, rich color and wet gel ink. I write on Clairefontaine, so I can't say what
regular dry time is. I noticed the ink run down faster than expected, but then I realized I'd filled
about 30 A5 pages.The 0.38's smoothness changes with your paper choice, but it never skips. "
marmiekali,"October 12, 2020","According to my JetPens order history, I've had this pen for over 7 years, and
it's still a great pen. I got Lavender Black, Green Black, and Bordeaux Black in
the same order in 2013, and they are all still going and great colors. Signos
are almost always a great choice. I have to confess that the needle nibs are my
favorites though. If they made needle versions of these colors I would buy those
in a heartbeat. "

instrument was for the ink color (which I love) and not the point size. My first

actually enjoy writing with it! I would recommend writers to try this tip size;
you may be pleasantly surprised."
Megan,"December 10, 2017","Excellent pen, no question. The color is my absolute favorite and it writes like
a dream. I wish it would last a bit longer, but all gel pens are used up quickly
and I do quite a bit of writing, so that is not at all a fault of the pen
itself. It is comfortable to write with even for long periods of time. As a
student, the thin tip really helps me to get a lot of information on sticky
notes and in the margins of books and papers. If you are into planners, it gives
you an alternative to black or blue for small boxes and checklists - without
having to settle for more garish colors. Love love love it"
Jocre,"November 29, 2017","I love the color ink, subtle not brash."
Zaac,"November 10, 2017","I used my first of these pens for over a year, and was really happy with it. 
The archival ink makes it fun and safe to use in my sketchbook... I have a habit
of going over any past doodles with watercolor, consequences be damned, and the
archival ink saves me from myself more often than not.  It also writes
incredibly smoothly when I use it in the office.. although the reason I had it
for a full year was that I was embarrassed to use it at work.  The ink is less a
tinted black than a berry (as other reviewers had mentioned), and it felt
inappropriate for signing checks and the other business applications for which I
initially bought it.  Still, it's great for drawing and doodling."

Wrenn,"June 26, 2017","I wanted a burgundy pen, so I got the Uni-ball Vision Elite BLX rollerball pen
in Red Black (0.5 mm), the Pilot G2 gel pen in Burgundy Red (0.7 mm), and the
Uni-ball Signo UM-151 gel pen in Bordeaux Black (0.38 mm), hoping that one or
all of them would be what I was looking for. They're all great pens, with
different strengths.The Uni-ball Signo Bordeaux Black isn't really burgundy at all — it's a very
deep, plummy purple, nowhere near as dark as the test shot on the site. I'm not
sure why ""black"" is in the name at all, because it's a beautiful deep, vivid
purple. The line is very fine, equivalent to the Morning Glory Mach 3 0.38 mm
rollerball pen (or perhaps slightly finer), and it's about half the width of the
lines of the BLX and the G2. Since it's a gel pen, it does not have any
feathering, and I was amazed by how quickly it dried. It isn't scratchy either,
despite the fine tip, but very smooth. On printer paper, it has practically zero
ghosting or bleed-through, but on cheap college-ruled notebook paper it has a
light amount of ghosting.The Uni-ball BLX Red Black is the color I had in mind when I purchased the pens:
a vivid, dark red burgundy. The Pilot G2 Burgundy Red is less red and more brown
and purple than the BLX, and it's also a full shade darker. You can see a full
comparison of the two pens on my reviews for them.For the purpose of a burgundy pen, I prefer the Red Black BLX to the Bordeaux
Black Signo, but the Signo is a fantastic pen and I love to use it — it
produces such an elegant line and color."

actually wish I wrote more..."
jessie.tran98,"February 2, 2017","Inkflow is pretty bad... The color is more of a deep purple than a bordeaux
black to me... It is just okay in overall to me. I think there are better
options!"
natasha e phillips,"January 31, 2017","I have become pretty obsessed with this one. For anyone interested in art these
are great for drawing/sketching! I've been looking for a new pen to do line art
with that won't skip over graphite or other inks like markers or even
watercolour. I know that if you want line art in cool colours you'll usually
have to sacrifice them being waterproof so I need them to work on top of other
wet media. These are amazing. The colour is what drew me in immediately and it
looks so nice over graphite in my sketchbook. Will be getting the blue black for
sure! These are smooth like a classic ball point pen too unlike the hi tech c
which I find a bit scratchy. Scratchy pens are not a deal breaker by any means I
don't care that much but it's another plus for the Uni!! <3 <3 <3"
Tosa Shopper,"January 26, 2017","Love the Bordeaux Black color. The pen writes smoothly on good quality paper,
including the notebook I purchased it for. It's a bit scratchy on cheap 20#
copier paper, but I wouldn't be using it for that. I'm not seeing any
bleed-through or feathering. I will be purchasing this one again."
Mitch,"January 23, 2017","The color is pretty, but the ink didn't feel quite smooth for writing."
Rebecca C,"January 19, 2017","    This pen is my favorite. It is so comfy and well made. Writing is smooth
with no skipping, or smearing."
pinkycomet,"January 12, 2017","The Uniball Signo has to be one of my favorite everyday pens. They always have
smooth ink flow, regardless of tip size. This pen was no exception. The tip has
to be the least scratchy of all my .38 tip pens, and the ink color is gorgeous.
The ink is a beautiful deep wine red, with a hint of purple. I strongly
recommend this pen for any use, be it art, work, or anything else really. The
color is serious enough to be able to write with it but still fun enough for
doodles (or grading papers, if you find that fun). "
mvlee,"December 16, 2016","Writes incredibly smooth and comfortable to hold. The only thing I had to get
used to was the small tip size since I'm used to writing with 0.5 to 1mm size. I
absolutely love this color. I've been really interested in black-colored inks
and this one is beautiful."
perish,"December 7, 2016","I bought two because this color is hard to find with the .38mm tip. It's so
pretty and vibrant, Ink flow is on point and .38mm is a dream to write with.
Uni-ball doesn't disappoint. "
Artsy13,"December 2, 2016","I love the sturdiness of conical tips and the fineness of needle tips, and this
is an incredible combination. A super fine conical tip with beautiful maroon
ink. I would recommend this pen for anyone who loves a fine line!"
sdt1015,"November 30, 2016",Awesome pen. Awesome color. Writes really well. No smudges.
lipa.arreola,"November 11, 2016",Not as dark of a color as I hoped. It was too light for my taste.
Mr Hazelnut,"November 7, 2016",The ink flow and colour are lovely. It's great for marking and note taking.
dtak84,"August 25, 2016","Love the tip size and flow of ink, but the color just looks like a maroon to me.
A little too much black and not enough red for my liking. "
Rodney,"August 15, 2016","The Signo has fast-become my favorite gel pen.I have been writing with gel pens a lot recently and the Uni-ball Signo .38mm
has become my favorite. Gel pens have always been my least favorite pens because
I had mostly only been exposed to the Pilot G2 .7mm. It's so thick and the ink
just runs out of the pen. Which is great for some applications but for
professional note taking I found it too blotchy. Then I found JetPens!I place the Signo it just ahead of the Hi-Tec-C by Pilot. The main difference
for me that makes it stand out is that its just a bit heavier and feels more
substantial in the hand. I don't mind the lighter Hi-Tec-C but I just like this
pen better. I bought the Bordeaux Black color to replace my red pen at work. I make a lot of
corrections and edits for my colleagues and this is a more muted color and looks
more professional. That being said, it doesn't stand out as much as a bright red
but for my purposes that's ok. I'll probably keep testing other reds to find the
perfect one. Verdict: Personally, I love the Bordeaux Black color. Not as bright as a red (in
fact its more like a purple) but very professional looking for a non-traditional
color. For editing, probably doesn't stand out enough to catch the eye. "

mattaaronhayes,"July 28, 2016","Best Gel Ink Pen Out There. Out of all the gel ink pens I own, the uniball signo

writing in my traveler notebook/planner. "

williamdleader,"July 22, 2016","The Bordeaux Black is one of my favorite colors!!! Fabulous pen and ink. Writes
great!!"
EdwardDillinger,"July 6, 2016","This is a lovely pen if you're looking for something red, but not really red (it
seems ideal for grading); however, if you're looking for ink the color of drying
blood, this is not so much the color for you. It's a bit too pinkish and not
enough brownish. If you liked the red-black 207, but want it in a smaller size
than the .7 mm available, you may have to keep looking, as the colors are very
dissimilar."
berryt79,"June 29, 2016","My pen didn't work very well VERY scratchy IF it wrote at all. This may have

maybe a minute or two before using, I would get a giant blotch on ink on the
paper. Could just be I got a bad pick of the pens since other color work
perfectly fine. but who knows."
nmendoza1983,"May 27, 2016","I love this pen. In fact I am ordering more colors.  Great weight and line.
Every so often the pen seems to dry and I have to shake it to get the ink going.

Charlotte Ng,"April 4, 2016",Love the color. Super smooth writing. Will order more of this in the future.
beadbabe77,"April 1, 2016","I like the bordeaux black color, use this pen a lot. Would prefer more of a 0.5

this stick pen because of my wine business when filling out wine journal cards."
ladyrawr,"March 26, 2016","I love how bold this color is. I used copics over this and surprisingly it

1968eric,"October 6, 2015","I usually prefer a retractable, but I can see why these are so popular among so
many. They became a new favorite. At least one of the two bordeaux black pens
might have had a factory defect. It tends to release small blobs of ink now and
then, hence only four stars. I do believe this is an anomaly because none of the
other colors I received in this model do this. "
betsyck123,"August 28, 2015","The color is as described, writes smoothly, extremely satisfied."

ashapiro,"June 16, 2015",Exactly what I was looking for.
cayt27,"June 4, 2015","Great rich color. Smooth and not scratchy. I wish it came in a 0.7. The 0.38 is
just a bit too small for my liking. But if that doesn't bother you and you are
attracted to the color - BUY THIS PEN! You will be very pleased!"
karenhutchinson13,"June 3, 2015","Liked the fine point nice,nice color. Would not say it was black at all, like
burgundy . Smooth ink flow , loved it! Would recommend, nice change from black

color but It looks fine on the paper and I like it. "
craftyisliz,"March 28, 2015","I didn't think I would like this size, but I got this anyway because I really
wanted to try this color. Let me say, I love this size! It's great to use in
small calendars. It's not as thin as I thought it would be, and this color is
great. I will say that the ink blobs at times. It happens with another Signo gel pen I
got in 0.5 mm. "
Kadejahhooks,"March 10, 2015","This pen is my fave, I use it to give all of my characters vampy lips."
autumnesquirrel,"March 10, 2015","This is the best color. I like things which are subtle, and this is just right.
Not black, but not a shocking red either. (Red always makes me think of school
when I write with it.) And so long as I don't push down too hard it writes
perfectly."
elly,"February 28, 2015","I love this pen so much! The colour is such a beautiful maroon/burgundy. I use
this for my school notes when I'm bored of plain old black/blue. It's so much
more colourful than black/blue but dark enough to read easily. The pen itself
writes beautifully, very smooth like all the other Uniball Signo DX pens, with
no skipping or blotting at all. "
gwendolynwilliams461,"February 16, 2015","Love it, especially the color!  Writing is smooth, negligible skipping.  Haven't
used it much yet but anticipate ordering more!"
jjung22,"February 3, 2015","It is a bordeaux wine color than black, unlike the other black series. Still a
gorgeous color though. Writes smoothly like all other uni-ball signo UM-151's.

HunterMacao,"January 19, 2015",I will be ordering more of these! That should tell you how much I like them.

these. Love the color but it's really close to maroon."
KeikiRN425,"November 9, 2014","Absolutely love these pens. Bright ink, and nice smooth writers! And retractable
points! "
romevi86,"February 4, 2014","This is my go-to correction pen. I like to type stories, but when I edit them I
opt for printing out the whole document and writing corrections/edits by hand.
This pen is perfect. It’s small enough for me to get into the tiny margins,
but bold enough for me to write without it feeling scratchy. I love the pen so
much I had to order the full color range! As for this particular color, what I like about it is that it’s a great option
against red. Red is a bold color to use for correction, as it stands easily out
from among the text. But no one likes seeing red on their own paper—even me.
It’s darker than red, a more darker purple of color, but not enough of the
royal hue to make one think that it’s violet. Overall, this is probably my
most favorite correction pen and color combination."
Vannie,"November 21, 2013","One of my favorite pens! It writes sooo smooth. The color is perfect too, I hate
writing in plain old black or blue ink, this adds a little umph to my writing ;)
I love it!"
Lapicerista,"April 28, 2013","Great color, I think that this is my favorite line of capped pens, amazing
colors and easy to hold and write.  Amazing reddish/wine black color, it allows you to write lengthy in a notebook
and adding a slight bit of color without being very flashy. "
mrs.tattershall,"March 1, 2012","First the good: I love the color, and the ink-flow. It has a nice crisp line
that looks good on almost any paper. The bad: I write with my fingers really close to the base of the pen, and since
the grip is at least 1/2"" away from the nib, I end up getting cramps in my hand
and the quality of my handwriting is diminished.  I wish they made Bordeaux black in a Pilot RT UM-138!"
jenny.jyiu,"October 10, 2010","LOVE the colour and amazing smoothness! Its not a showy colour but really pops
off the page."
JULIEKENNEY,"January 7, 2012","Love this pen!Writes surprisingly smooth.  The ink flow is good and the line width consistent.
 I've not had any problems with  blotchiness, skips or blobs.  The color is
fantastic!  It doesn't leap off the page and smack you in the face, just a great
red/maroon.  I really like the tip as well.  I use a lot of pressure when I
write and some of the smaller tipped pens feel really fragile under the
pressure.  This one holds up like a champ.  I use this pen for underlining and
writing in my Bible and it is one of the very few that do well in that capacity.
 The ink does not bleed through the super-thin pages and the pigments keep it
from fading or migrating through the paper over time like ballpoint pen or dye
based gel inks.  The 0.38 mm size dries quickly enough that I haven't had any
trouble with smearing.  Only negative point is that the cap doesn't snap on very
tight and I hate chasing a pen cap under the desk.  I wish Uni-ball made these
the same as the retractable 207 Uni-ball pens."
l8bloomer,"April 25, 2012","So sad about this pen. I liked the flow of the ink, but after using it once, it
leaked all over the place. Won't buy this model again."
kjg,"November 6, 2022","This pen looks better in person than it does in the pictures. I love how
well-polished the nib is and how the light hits the purple-and-yellow part
around the tip. It also writes very smoothly, and the cap provides a good seal
as I would expect from TWSBI."
batch389,"January 10, 2023",My cherished Twisbi.  Easy to fill and a very smooth even writing tool. Pretty. 
Eckert,"July 19, 2016","I've tried all of the color-black gel inks Uni-Ball provides now and without
hesitation I can say the green-black is my favorite by far, especially with the
.38 mm nib. It writes as a very attractive, deep forest green. I've purchased
this same brand and ink color in a larger size (the .7 mm) and found it seemed
to lose some of it's color the wider the stroke, so the .38mm seems to be the
perfect size if you really want that perfect subtle green to show in your
writing. Highly recommend this pen."
ebenfatto,"April 26, 2011","I love this pen. It writes smoothly, and the ink is a deep, pine green that
looks great no matter where I've used the pen. The color is subtle (it doesn't
scream ""I'm GREEN!"") but still looks unique."
SongDuck,"January 25, 2012","Love this pen, it is quickly becoming my favorite. Writes rather fluidly for a
0.38 mm point. In fact, I am extremely impressed with how small I am able to
write, without skipping or any problem whatsoever. It reminds me of fine writing
instruments I used as a draftsperson many years ago. The green-black ink is a
wonderful color, more of a pine green. I love writing with it so much that I
plan to order more in different colors to use for both writing & drawing. At
this price I can afford to indulge. Thanks JetPens."
al.surges,"June 28, 2018","It is probably because of the fine point but the ink is patchy in all of these
pens I own. Too much ink will come out at once and then it'll stop working for a
bit. I gave it 4 stars though because of the color. The color is very nice it's
my favorite green black ink pen color that I own. A very dark green."
TinaBug,"April 24, 2018","The Signo pen line are by far my favorite pens.  I have small handwriting and
they work perfect for me.  I've only used the retractable version until now and
I like the cap style pens a lot.  The weight of the pen feels much different
than the retractable though. This green is very dark, just like it says.  Green black - you can still
distinguish that it is green.  It's actually very pretty.  The pen tip is sharp
which I like but if you are a heavy writer, it will probably leave a groove on
your paper.  "
katfaquino,"September 8, 2017","This is a great green black color, and a very smooth writer. My only problem
with this pen is the placement of the grip. It's too far up in the barrel for me
and if I was holding the pen there, I'd be writing at too much of an angle that
the pen would be scratchy."
Wrenn,"June 26, 2017","A beautiful deep green ink. The line is very fine, probably the finest of all my
pens, even compared to the Morning Glory Mach 3 (also 0.38 mm), and it doesn't
feather at all. The pen is a little scratchy (more so than the UM-151 Bordeaux
Black, which I found surprisingly smooth), but the scratch is so minor that it
doesn't bother me. The ink dries quickly, and ghosting is practically
nonexistent on printer paper, though there is light to moderate ghosting (but
zero bleed-through) on cheap, thin college-ruled notebook paper. The only
detraction is that the ink isn't very consistent, and sometimes it'll fade
slightly in the middle of a word. The ink doesn't stop running altogether, the
line just gets fainter and the color lighter. That hasn't happened with my
Bordeaux Black, so perhaps the flaw is unique to the Green Black ink? Still, I
love the color and the fine line."
Geslina,"June 8, 2017","I love the Signo pens, and wish this one came in a .28.... but even in the .38,
I really like it.  It's a deep, woodsy, warm dark green.  Not a blue green at
all.  Not too obvious, and like all the Uniball Signo DX pens, it writes like a
dream.The barrel is not too thick, and the cap goes on with a satisfying click, and
stays on - whether you are capping the tip, or putting the cap on the opposite
end so that you can write.The only downside to these pens, as it is with most fine tip pens, is that if
you drop it, and it lands tip down, it's a goner.  So don't drop it!  You'll be
very sad if you do."
Indy Guy 1962,"July 8, 2016","I used this pen to make notes for an on-line class I just finished (30 or so
pages of notes), and I really like it.  The pine-green color is subtle yet
distinctive, and it never skips or globs.  The cap makes a satisfying ""click"" as
it goes on and off the pen.My only small complaint is that the cushioned grip has an edge (allowing for the
cap to click in place) right below my preferred gripping spot.  This is true of
all the DX pens.  I didn't find this uncomfortable really, but I always noticed
it was there.I now have all of the darker DX colors and find myself using them constantly."
cosmicCrucible,"January 17, 2023","Honestly this was a surprise favorite for me. I didn't pay attention to the
size, and love this thin size for writing in my Hobonichi weeks. I typically
prefer a .5, but with the smaller squares in this notebook I love the smaller
point and this pen rarely scratches or skips for me and seems to dry quite
quickly."
mrs.shedd30,"November 29, 2022","See both green and black, I like it."
jalmascok,"November 9, 2022","Really love the color of this ink!! Vibrant, smooth and looks great on paper.

experience for smooth, clean with no clumps plus fun color!! Get the set, every
color is fantastic!! "
j.keppispapo,"November 7, 2022","Gel pen that I used to like, it does not dry fast enough and it coagulates at

withadventure,"September 22, 2022","I really do like these pens, but I find that they skip often and that gets
really annoying. Even the slightest bit of anything on the tip will make it
impossible to write with this thing. I got these to make annotations in my textbooks and in the margins of my
research papers, but even on regular paper it picks up small fibers and starts
skipping. If you want to be patient and keep wiping your pen off then these are great, but
they didn't do well for what I wanted. "

classy.The pen: I'm honestly really impressed with the quality and consistency of this
.38 mm line.  My fear was that a size this fine would skip a bunch, but no -
this works very well.Overall: it's a nice gel pen in an offbeat color - go for it."
foxdenfarms7,"January 25, 2022","Great pens. For the price none better. Now if they would only offer refills for
every color they would be untouchable. They are inexpensive but come on you make
the refills, just sell them all separately. I believe that is taking advantage
of your customers. You only offer refills in three colors, black, blue, and red.
None of which are my favorite colors. "

noahschaffer,"March 28, 2021","Nice pen. Writes smoothly, and doesn't require pressure. I love that these are
capped rather than click-pens. I haven't done a water test, but my impression is
that they resist water. They dry pretty fast. I love the .38mm size.I'm not super happy with the color. It's so black that you can barely see the
green in it. I tried the ""green"" color, but it's way too light. I guess the
Signo has nothing in between. In fountain pens, I've been using Noodler's Green
Marine. I love that Green Marine shade, and this Signo green/black is comparably
way too dark and doesn't have any green. I guess the idea is that the green
should be super-subtle for an office environment, but I do want to give the note
of warning.Note that the grip ends fairly far from the tip on the Signo pens. I've been
varying my grip a bit, but I used to always grip my pen near the tip. On these,
if you grip the pen near the tip, then the rubber grip isn't really under your
fingers. This issue is specific to how you hold the pen, though. "

lark,"February 9, 2021","The green tint is quite subtle (particularly with this fine of a tip) but really
nice, especially in brighter lighting, and very unique. I mainly got this pen to
have a cheap, very fast-drying pen to use on Clairefontaine/Rhodia paper (which
it certainly does—it dries pretty much instantly) and chose the green color on
a whim, but I've been pleasantly surprised at how much I like the color and
enjoy writing with the pen."

are almost always a great choice. I have to confess that the needle nibs are my
favorites though. If they made needle versions of these colors I would buy those

the point tends to accumulate ink and then when you start writing the first

bhenn,"November 22, 2015","The most critical element of my search is to replace a professional dark green
[Black Green; Hunter Green; Forest Green] ink with fine tip & ease of writing. I
had a pen that was great fo15 years that is no longer available. I feel like
Goldilocks and the 3 Bears. Gel pens are great for writing especially large
volumes. I purchased a quantity of both(1) Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen - 0.38 mm - Green Black  - Great colour,
however very scratch writing.Perhaps a 0.5 mm tip instead of the 0.38 mm.(2) Zebra Sarasa Retractable Gel Pen - 0.7 mm - Forest - Can live with the
colour but a bit too dark (in some lighting it appears black). The writing was
very comfortable smooth but the tip was a bt too large and made things more
messy and consumed significant more space that the 0.38 tip. So I am hoping for a Goldilocks solution of one in between that is 'just
right.!'I need some help - is the Zebra Sarasa Retractable Gel Pen available in 0.5mm?
Is the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen available in 0.5mm? And these requests MUST
be a dark green - Hunter Green or Forest Green or Black Green;[Or has the Sanford unibal Gel Grip Forest Pen 0.7 mm that I used for 15 years

smooth, the 0.5 mm uni-ball vision elite BLX rollerball pens are lovely as well:
I like the UM-151 for smaller, more intentional, maybe neater writing and
thinner paper (agenda and journal), and the vision elite blx for writing more
speedily and messily because they glide along so effortlessly. "

several.  The ink color is conservative enough for work but a nice change from
black, blue, or blue-black, and the ink is smooth, waterproof, and provided in a
extremely generous quantity (lasts months for me).(Minor) issues noted over a year of use:1) Occasional skipping with one particular pen, but a firm tap on the paper
corrected this easily.2) The ink dried slowly on a postcard made of some kind of slick coated paper. 
It works great on all other papers I've used, though."

this green black is amazing, and so is the reddish/wine black (bourdeaux)."
stan,"February 25, 2012","Awesome color and pen. I love Hi-Tec, Slicci, and Uni-ball Signo. My only
complaint about this pen is that sometimes the ink ""gunks up"" at the tip. I love
all the xxx-black Signo pens. I wish the .28 had all the black colors. My
favorite 0.25 and 0.3 pen is the slicci. My favorite 0.4 and 0.5 pen is the
Hi-Tec c. I like the signo also even though the grip is just above where I place
my fingers. I will buy more of these."
lalbert6,"October 4, 2011","I love the color, and I love the thickness of the line this pen produces.  Unfortunately, the one I got doesn't like to write unless I'm holding the pen

with, but I'm willing to give it another shot, since it seems like this problem
is limited to the particular pen I got. "
joe_hh,"September 28, 2010","Again, main complaint is that this color is not dark enough to use on any kind

artist_40k,"March 16, 2012","If you are looking for the equivalent(and probably even better version) of the
High tech C try the Uni-Ball Signo DX 0.28mm or the zebra sarasa 0.3 mm. Both

they're cheaper than the high tech c. Both also come with a grip and do not have
a fragile needle point like the high tech c."
BruhBruhsterson,"February 17, 2015","I had really high hopes for these. A lot of reviews were either really
encouraging or really nasty. I decided I'd try them out for myself. They are
super thin, but they don't write well. They scratch way too much and the ink
color just isn't there. Try the 0.4mm one, it writes like a dream."
dorn9503,"December 7, 2015","While I gave the .3mm version of this pen a lower rating, this version is going
to be 'my study pen'.  I definitely find that the seemingly small difference in
tip size has made a huge difference in the way the pen works for me.  It puts
such a small amount of ink on the paper that I am able to write very small,
which I do, without smudging or 'pooling' in the tight letters.  I read one
review of this pen that said the line it writes can almost be confused with one
from a mechanical pencil, and that is the best comparison I could make as well. 
It is truly the pen for you if you are looking to do annotating of study
material either in the margins or between the lines."
eugenebl,"December 14, 2010","A good pen, ink can actually be the same or thinner than the 0.18 uni-ball. It
is better for long, straight lines (eg. cross-hatching) than for short, sketchy
ones that the uni-ball is good at. Its ink is much thinner than the Slicci,
which is also 0.25. Sometimes the ink seems to stop flowing and things get a bit
scratchy. Note: this pen is not waterproof, and will bleed strange purplish
tones if exposed to water. The 0.18 uni-ball is waterproof. Everything has its use, though. I use this pen to write small notes, and for
cross-hatching in comics. It's good at both of those."
Ryan.Dix.2018,"November 21, 2012","Hands down my favorite pen. I bought every gel pen on Jetpens under .4 mm, and
in one clean swoop decided that this is by far the best. The tip size is very
small, however if you have a light hand the ink will continue to flow well. At
first, expect to have a hard time with this pen, but after a little writing it
will be a very enjoyable experience. "
hunter.t.strickland,"August 16, 2017","The super fine line makes it great for sketching in a pocket sketch book where
you only have a few inches of room. They do feel scratchy but I'm guessing that
is just the nature of such a fine point pen since I haven't used any other
0.25/0.3mm sized gel pens to compare. I really like the feel of the slim bare
plastic barrel. The flow was not good straight out of the box. It would come and go mid line but
after dipping the tip in some rubbing alcohol and scribbling around it opened
right up and hasn't given me any issues since. "
romsa9,"September 28, 2015","This pen has become my new favourite pen once I started doing a few things:1) To keep the ink flow excellent - make sure you store them with cap-on,
point-side-down. So that gravity keeps the ink near the tip. While writing, it
also helps to shake the ink towards the tip by holding it at the other end, and
shaking the tip end. These don't make a huge difference, but it helps to avoid
the 2% chance of you line ending prematurely - especially when your pen is
running low on ink.2) I bend the needle tip 30-40 degrees. I've never broken a pen yet but, I take
care to never bend it past 40 degrees. This eliminates the scratchiness you get
from the angle of the pen, as long as you keep the bent tip relatively
perpendicular to the paper. The other thing this lets you do is to very
accurately control the line thickness from full all the way to barely visible.
Keep a scratch pad handy to test your line right before you make the
stroke/crosshatch. Great for sketches and solid lines.Following these two habits, this pen has become my new favourite. (Before it was
the Slicci 0.25mm)"
M Murphy,"July 24, 2015","Okay. I'll admit it. The first time I came across a Tec-C, I had totally stolen
it from a coworker. She let me borrow it and I fell in love and I just kept it.
I don't do that normally. But it was worth the risk and I regret nothing,
because these pens are SO GOOD. If you write from a low angle, you're gonna get
scratching. Don't write from a low angle. Tilt the butt of your pen up a bit
more. Trust me. These pens glide like the wind. I love them. I love them so
much. "

sheepdogg325,"October 12, 2011","At first I thought that I really liked this pen (I bought this pen along with
the uni-ball signo bit .28), but not long after I started using it the ink
stopped flowing consistently and then pretty much refused to write more than one
word without choking up.  I bought this pen over a year ago and test it
periodically to see if it has decided to work... but it still won't.  My
uni-ball, however, is still my primary note-taking pen and I have never had a
problem with it.  I suppose that it is possible that I simply recieved a
defective pen, but I have ordered dozens of products from Jetpens and never had
a similar problem In summary; disappointing pen!"
papertreehouse,"August 2, 2019","I Love how fine a point these pens have but after using them a while I've noted

get it flowing again."
25miscellanous,"June 26, 2018","Finest tip pen I´ve ever used, as well as the scratchiest, but that is a given

I´d go with something a .3 tip or finer since it is vastly smoother."
emmaswan,"April 14, 2018","Pilot pens are top quality, and the Hi Tec C is no exception. However, I have to
say that even though I live for fine tipped pens, this one is only usable in
very specific situations. I pretty much only use this for lineart, and even
then, only on Bristol board or in a notebook. This is a very true to size 0.25
tip-- it's insane. Just make sure if you buy this, you know that it's not going
to be able to preform for everyday writing. :) "
Charlie,"June 6, 2017","I bought this pen because of all the reviews that I've been reading.  It does
have a very fine line.  It's also very scratchy if I write in cursive.  If I
print then it's a lot less scratchy.  I have compared this Hi-Tec C Gel 0.25 to
my other writing instruments - Uniball's 0.28 in RT & Uni's Style Fit 0.28 and
Pentel's Slicci 0.25.  I even compared it to Uniball's Signo bit 0.18.  It's a
lot like the Signo bit 0.18 - which I like.  But I would have to say that my
favorite of the bunch is going to be Uniball's 0.28 RT & Pentel's Slicci 0.25. 
These 2 pens write very well and are hard to beat."
Umbrella,"December 14, 2016","This pen writes so thin, my friend didn't even believe that it wasn't a
mechanical pencil at first! The ink is super and flows really nicely. However,
the pen does skip and it's not waterproof. I've tried with a brand of alcohol
markers and it seems to work fine with those. On dried watercolor, the pen does
show up on the thicker patches of pigment and you may have to go over the lines
several times to break the pigment apart and get a line down.I would purchase this pen again however since I think it has more pros than
cons."
Fierce dragon,"January 11, 2016","If you love thin lines this is the best.without a doubt, will be buying more.saw
a video on youtube,and knew immediately u had to have one. Didn't let me
down.must have if serious about drawing."
pastor dale,"July 11, 2015","Fine lines with very little hand pressure. For underlining and notes in the
margins of a bible nothing can compare to the Pilot Hi-Tec C .25. Lets you write
smaller and legible in tight places. The light bleed through the page from the
ink is not a problem. This pen comes in more than enough colors to keep your
thoughts organized. The Hi-Tec C .25 has replaced my Uni-ball .38, for sermons
and bible notes. For everyday use Uni-ball is cheaper & writes very nice."
lightning spaniel,"April 17, 2015","Ultimate precision.  This pen will create the finest, tiniest lines you could
need.  Basically, you're drawing with a needle and it is quite scratchy.  Make
sure you're using a smoother paper and you should have better consistency with
the lines."
lauren.ciechanowski,"July 8, 2014","This pen is great for a pencil-like experience on high-quality paper (I have
several Rhodia pads), but even then the tip can give me the sensation as though
it's cutting into the paper. I barely press down when I write, so it's not a
pressure issue on my end.  If you intend to use this pen on not-fancy paper its
best application is that of a fine-edge knife. The pen is snobby, I suppose.
Other reviewers who suggested to buy a size or two up are spot-on; I have
several Hi-Tec .4's that provide the same lines as Signo .28's or Slicci .25's.
If you like a pencil-quality line in ink, and you use smooth, high-quality
paper, you and this pen will be very happy together. "
jayr19931,"January 11, 2023","Very VERY fine pen, I love it but can’t seem to keep the ink flowing for
others to read what I write. It is scratchy like other users have said but
that’s no issue for me. I probably won’t use it to write much but I’ll
definitely keep it to draw fine lines.  I also bought the blue and red and they
both seem to have the same issues with not enough ink coming out"
cat.lobre,"December 29, 2022","I bought this pen because I needed to write some very small text on several
small labels. It works really well, other than the occasional tip clog that I
find happens when I use the Pilot Hi-Tec-C Gel Pens, but that hasn't stopped me
from using this pen all the time. The ink dries fairly quickly and has not
smeared at all, which was a problem with the previous pens I used. I will
definitely buy this again in the future!"

withadventure,"August 29, 2022","This seems a bit too thin for the ink. I had issues with this pen skipping and
not wanting to write very well. However, when it was working the line was so
satisfyingly thin. I used it to write in my books when I was annotating because
there's absolutely no bleed through. "
scouts10hut,"July 18, 2022","Oh My Gosh.  This is the most awesome pen.  I absolutely love it.  So
inexpensive and it writes so small.  I tell everyone about this pen."
drewhah,"July 13, 2022","Let me guess, you draw really small. You'll spend 2+ hours on a post-it. If you
leaned any further into this habit, you'd be doing comic pages on a grain of
rice. Drawing big and broad, though likely beneficial for your overall skillset,
never feels right. You can't help but cram minuscule details into an already
small drawing rather than draw it bigger and make room for more detail and
forgiveness should a pen-stroke go astray. If any of this feels like an attack,
this may be your pen. It grants a super clean thin line, and while some reviews
don't appreciate the limited angle you can hold the pen at in order to draw, I
found it advantageous: once you find where that threshold is, you can
intentionally hold it at an angle and get EVEN THINNER lines. I'm talking
hairline thin wisps of ink. This pen is a monument to every artist's refusal to
draw bigger. "

LizB,"March 24, 2022","It can be a little finicky... BUT I have discovered that if I store it tip-down
in a cup and use it on my Japanese papers I have almost no issues with skipping
or scratching.I love the CLICK when you remove, post, and cap the pen. Very satisfying. I like that the ink is smooth and opaque. It dries in a flash and I have had no
problems highlighting over it. The fact that the line is so thin makes it great
for notes/annotations that I want to fade into the background. "
kemmerer19,"March 16, 2022","In my opinion i really like this pen it have a good pen flow it just does feel

extremely undependable. "

marino,"November 17, 2021","I use this to draw - I usually work in very small formats (15x15 cm) so the
thinner the pen, the better.I had some mixed results in the past by buying a bunch of these on Amazon: I got
4 of these and only one was working reliably (the other 3 were always running
dry and scraping the paper instead of leaving a clear mark on it).I was a bit frustrated and decided to try buying a single one from Jetpens:
maybe I was just unlucky with the previous set, this one works flawlessly."

aivysaur,"August 30, 2021","The line thickness is so thin that I sometimes need to squint to read the words.
This pen didn't smudge the paper or my palm immediately after releasing ink on
the paper. The pen nib occasionally scratches the paper but that doesn't stop
the ink from flowing or cause a break in the line. This could be an incredible
tool for drawing thin lines for art."

wtcy,"August 11, 2021","Favorite pen ever! I get 10 of these periodically because they're just amazing
for everything, including schoolwork. Only issue is that, because they're .25

fixable by just scribbling around a bit. Also, they're quite scratchy, which I
personally like."

vanity_elric,"April 6, 2021","I was surprised by how fine this pen was! When I add some thickness to a line, I
do have to wait for it to dry before erasing the pencil underneath, but
thankfully it's also quick drying. My Sakura .25 keeps splitting and fraying,
but this has not split, frayed, or broken. When held at just the right angle, I
can also create a broken line which is a little trick I like to do with some of
my linework. It has nice control, good flow, and good dark pigment. Definitely
will purchase again. "
JTail,"March 5, 2021","A little scratchy but it's so tiny, what else can you expect. The ink seems a
little on the grey side rather than black to me, but that could also be because
the line is too thin. I think I'd go back to 0.38 rather than buy more of these
size pens."
Devon,"February 25, 2021","Wonderful ink flow but I found this nib size too scratchy. It is a true 0.25mm

little more pressure while you write, this pen could intimidate you. If you
don't write lightly you might be afraid of breaking/snapping the tip. I would
also recommend storing the pen horizontally, I have had issues at times with the
ink not flowing as well if it's stored right-side up (probably due to the
narrowness of the tip). But overall, a great pen that provides an exceptionally
fine line!"

Asclepius,"February 14, 2020","I love these pens. They are incredibly precise and I use them on a daily basis.
I work in healthcare, and I value penmanship, so these are the perfect
combination. I am able to annotate notes, add lab values into margins, and
create clean, crisp notes. I did deduct one star, however, because on multiple
occasions I have had these pens stop working with about a quarter of the ink
still left. No matter what I try, they just wouldn't start writing again. This
is the exception, not the rule though! I will continue to buy these pens
forever."

point lines, making it great for hatching and detailed work. The only con is
that sometimes the pen skips or dries out for a bit. You kind of have to
scribble off to the side for a bit to get it running. Once it starts to flow

time and the ink flow is not as consistent as I expected."
Chenry,"February 27, 2019","While the ink flows smoothly, the tip can get caught in rougher paper. This is
due to the sheer thinness of the .25mm pen. I recommend smoother paper (20lb
copy paper works fine). Planning and journaling is excellent. Taking notes is
easier than ever because I can fit in more information in a smaller space.
Higher viscosity ink, like the Hi-Tec-C provides, allows the luxury of this kind
of tight, small writing because it doesn't bleed or feather."
Sabrina,"January 19, 2019","This pen is surprisingly smooth and is perfect for doodles and zentangles. It's
pretty comfortable in the hand when writing and it doesn't skip. When scribbling
it on a scrap piece of paper, there were no skips and it didn't feel scratchy on
the paper.The ink also doesn't seem to smear or leave ink on the Zebra Mildliner on
regular printer paper, which is nice."
francisco.ruiz17,"January 2, 2019","Always a fan of Pilot pens, the Hi-Tec-C's are always fine pens. Pronounced ink

1976,"October 10, 2017","I bought this pen because i had seen some artists use them and swear by them, so
i gave it a go. The 0.25 mm size is incredible for small detail and for

helps but it gets annoying. "

etiernan597,"August 28, 2017","I tend to write very small so I thought this pen would be amazing. But the ink
flow is not great, the line is sometimes hard to read, the color shows up more
like gray than black, and the tip feels like it is on the verge of breaking. The
0.3 model has none of these problems. If you are inking or doing some line work
that needs something this thin- I suppose it works. But for writing, bump up to
the 0.3 point. "

ended up bending the whole metal tip. I'm not sure what made the ink stop flowing before that, but I used it for

Not one of them has used all the ink and all of them have stopped working. Oh
you can dip them in hot water and they work for a time, undependable is the
bottom line. I would give this Pilot pen three stars except the cost is high for
a pen that quit working."

wingstriker,"June 16, 2016","I bought this and the blue version of this pen a while back since I was looking
for a pen that wrote a thin line for my paper planner. It doesn't really work as
well as I'd hoped. I feel like I'm always scratching the paper when I use this
pen (even on paper from Exacompta / Clairefontaine which is known for their
smooth paper), and it skips a LOT.Maybe the ink refill that came with the pen is to blame but this happened on the
blue 0.25mm pen too. I also had to slow down my writing speed to coax it to
work. Sometimes it just refused to write.I bought a 0.5mm refill for this pen to see if this problem still exists. I'm
happy to say that the 0.5mm refill writes a lot more smoothly and consistently
than the 0.25mm refill ever did.I recommend the 0.38mm Jetstream over this pen since it never skips and still
writes smoothly despite the thin line."
bcd.lib,"May 31, 2016",Hard to beat for ease of writing
Circe,"May 20, 2016","This is a great pen and was my introduction into the world of skinny pens. If
you like this one, though, I encourage you to check out the G-Tec-C4 pen-- same
great tiny point, but the barrel has a plastic cushion that makes it that much
more comfortable to hold. Also check out the Maica by Pilot--same pen, different
body and beautiful colours. "
bilojorna,"April 9, 2016","I want this to be a perfect pen, but it isn't. The tip is scratchy and the ink,
occasionally, skips. However, if you don't mind shaking it or heating the point
before every use, the HI-TEC 0.25 mm can be a good pen for stippling or doodling
on a small sketch pad. "
drwall,"March 4, 2016","I liked the needle like tip, but like many really fine tip pens, it tends to
stop writing, which is annoying."
jerrylee25,"February 9, 2016","Nice fine line, love the fine point, makes writing very neat until it starts to
skip. Expensive due to drying out soon after first use, have yet to use half the
ink before skipping and having to use a new refill.  Refills are needed twenty
times or more frequent than normal use of other pens."
cfish,"February 2, 2016","I bought this for technical drawing but yeah, 0.25 is a bit thin. Very thin. The
ink flows well. but it's thinner than I expected. It's my fault I guess, Not
having a clear idea how thin it is."
masterinvader,"January 21, 2016","I prefer to use extremely thin nibs so I decided to try this one out. I like how
thin this one is but sometimes the ink can be inconsistent. Not only that, a lot
of care needs to go in to this pen because the nib seems like it can be damaged
very easily. "
cknlomein,"November 25, 2015",Tip feels unstable.
eschaertlm,"November 1, 2015","Meh, the ink stopped flowing after a few sentences. Maybe I write too hard. The
0.30 definitely performed better for me."
Blackhorse,"August 28, 2015",Excellent
avfreq,"August 24, 2015",Great pen. Loved it.
jservi,"July 7, 2015","Ink flow is not very consistent while trying to write or draw fast, but seems
fine when I try to use it more slowly. Can get very scratchy easily. When it
works right though the lines are very thin and sharp. Ink is not waterproof.
Unless 0.25mm is absolutely essential for you, I recommend the slightly bigger
sizes that tend to have better ink flows like 0.38mm."
romevi86,"June 16, 2015","Good pen, though a bit scratchy. Also, the barrel is thicker than it needs to
be. Still, the 0.25 is a rare tip point to come by, so if you're looking for one
this is one hard to beat."

zeldeenee,"March 9, 2015","I found this pen very scratchy and frequently stopped ink flow. It might be due
to the very fine point, but my comparable Slicci did not give me nearly as much

luka,"November 15, 2014","this is the perfect pen for drawing! i bought a few of them to use in my
moleskine sketchbook, black being my favorite of them, and it slides over the
smooth paper like a dream. while a fair warning i would have to agree with- the
needle-point tip of this pen is very scratchy for writing on simple paper. i
wouldn't recommend the 0.25 tip for writing at all, really, especially if you're
a fast writer. but as i said, i bought this pen for drawing, and i am not
disappointed in any way by it for that purpose. if you're looking for a black
pen to write smoothly with, i'd recommend uniball jetstream. "
t_hauf,"September 19, 2014","I bought this pen with the intention of drawing with it. It worked really well
at first, it produced surprisingly black lines for how this they were. Over time
the ink flow became a lot less consistent to the point where it is really hard
for me to use and be confident in it, although, with coxing it work well again
at times. Because the nib is so small it can be a challenge to write or draw
with the pen without it feeling like you are stabbing the paper. Along with
that, I did find that it is a bit fussy with some paper. The nib can clog with
fibers sometimes if you are using a paper that has even a little bit of tooth to
it.I am left handed and  since this pen falls under the ""left handed"" tag, I wanted
to say I did not have any issues with smearing, but writing was little
frustrating because of how small the nib is.Overall good, but I would recommend the 0.4 mm before this pen"
suwan.mai,"August 19, 2012","I was really hoping to LOVE LOVE LOVE this pen because it was .25 mm and I'm a
huge fan of super fine pens. BUT I was kind of disappointed because I found the
barrel to be really uncomfortable to write with because it was so small. Pros:Super Fine TipSmooth LinesGood, Well Known BrandSure to Impress Others Cons:Uncomfortable, No GripKind of expensive for something that doesn't try to be aesthetically pleasing...
Then again I kind of like the simple design. I'm going to try using other pens of similar fineness but different brands so
I'll probably post an update later... Overall it's a very nice pen to have and use, I can't get enough of the fine
point. I will most likely buy this pen again just because I feel happy just
knowing I have it in my JetPen stash... (I'm kind of obsessed)"
rickb928,"May 12, 2011","I first used a H-Tec-C Cavalier almost 10 years ago, I think. and I'm waiting
impatiently for them to come back into stock. Until then, the basic stick is a
pleasure! It is a little scratchy, which I like, something like a very sharp 4H
drafting lead, and it's a nice feel for me. The truly fine point sure beats
those 0.5 paintbrushes, ick! Thanks, Jetpens!!!"
oliviaheaner,"November 22, 2010","THis needs a better barrel. I would buy more if it was better. But other than that great!!!"
c_cbm704,"November 22, 2010","I've been using this pen for years and just love it. I agree with a previous
writer that if you have a heavier hand it may not be the right one for you. This
is one of the best pens on the market and will continue to order them as long as
Jet Pens continues to carry them. Thank you JetPens! C from South Carolina, USA"
gisela5,"August 22, 2009","this pens a good write! my only complaint about this pen is the barrel design. i
think if it was a bit more ergonomic id chose it over the signo .28mm. it doesnt
feel like youre holding an awesome pen in your hand, infact, it feels more like
youre holding one of those cheaper crystal pens you pick up at the office supply
store that are 10 for a dollar. but i STILL really like it! heh."
EMazzone,"November 23, 2008","I love this pen.  I wish it had a more egernomic barrel. I added a piece to make it fit my hand
better and I am using the trainer to hold it in the correct position. Can the refills be made in more colors. I espically like the violet. Write on!"
smithl3257,"November 17, 2008","I also find that these pens are quite durable. Perhaps heavy handers might not
want to purchase this type, but I have seen a few heavy hands write quite well
with the .25 and the pen survived. I also have tried the unibit .18 and though
the black and blue write well, I did not find success with colored ones,
however, overall, I prefer the pilot hi tec as it seems more durable."
hartzog2000,"August 28, 2008","I like this series of gel pens. I have all 4 nib sizes. The nib, some say, is
fragile but I don't believe that is the case, at least not in my experience. I
don't have to press hard to get them to make a mark so I am less likely to break
the nibs than someone with a heavy hand. If you treat these pens right they
perform just fine. The 0.25mm nib of course makes the finest line and the 0.5mm the widest.
However, and it should come as no surprise, the smaller the nib the ""rougher""
the pen feels when writing with it. However the nibs being smaller in diameter
than other pens their nib size they make for excellent drafting/drawing pens
when you use a straight edge such as a triangle or ruler. Again one does not
have to press hard to get these pens to produce a line. The ink in these pens is dark and the pens write without skipping or the ink
running out unevenly. The ink supply is typical of such pens, maybe a tad more
generous. The clear plastic barrels have a ribbed surface for grasping near the
nib. The are as comfortable as any plastic barreled pen or pencil. The only
thing that could make these pens any better is to make the retractable."
q335r49,"December 12, 2007","I have several of these pens, and they have all broken before they had run out
of ink. They do write well while they last, but each pen has a different feel
and a different results under pressure -- and, authough perhaps very precise,
these are perhaps the least 'expressive' pens to the extent that it's hard to
vary the width by varying pressure. Again, they are highly unusalbe. I would recommend many of the other thin pens
on this site -- at least give them a try! -- such as the Pentel Slicci. Very
durable, and very expressive"
ronmcvicar,"May 8, 2007","Having used the Uni-ball Signo Bit .18mm I wanted to acquire a micro tipped pen
without the mess or bleed of felt or drafting pens, but with a denser ink than
the bit, the Hi-tec-c .25 mm fit the bill perfectly. A much more reproducible
line is achievable with this pen than the Bit, and the nib is slightly more
durable, the ink is vibrantly dark and abundant. My only complaint was with the
wiggle in the pen because of it's disposable plastic construction, a stiffer
construction could provide a more responsive drawing and writing experience.
Four out of Five."

sketching and perfect for journaling (i.e. Moleskine pocket notebooks)."
Some Rainstorms,"March 10, 2018","These colors are amazing. The black-red one is my favorite, but they're all
beautiful. The photos online don't do them justice. They look amazing in person,
especially in the light. And they really do look very different depending on the
color of paper you're writing on. Writing with these is a very smooth
experience. Some things to take note of:-not waterproof--they smudge very easily when wet-they take a while to dry, so again, be wary of smudging-I've had the glitter clog the pens every now and then, but it doesn't happen
often. That can't really be helped when you put glitter in ink. -The silver and gold in this set are still decently visible on white and lighter
colored paper, but would work best on darker pages. The rest are very vribrant
on both light and dark paper. "
Cheryl,"April 10, 2018","So cute and at first I thought it was a repackaged pentel metallic pens from the

these so much. My favorite colors are the navy blue gel with turquoise glitter.
The orange gel with yellow glitter and the pink gel with red glitter and the
purple with blue glitter. Whoever thought of these did such an amazing job!!
These pens are super cute with an edge. Great for arts and crafts and school
projects and I’ve already bought 3 packs. One pack from jet pens and two more
from a retail store. My only two cons about the product that they are very
expensive $25 a pack. Secondly, the ink goes quick. But with that being said,
these pens are defiantly worth it. As long as they’re in production, I’ll
keep purchasing. Thank you jet pens. "

rather thick line (seems more generous than 1.0 mm) but the glitter/ink
combinations are absolutely gorgeous. As you might expect from pens like this,
they ink drains quickly, but they are still worth it. For glitter pens, they
also write surprisingly smoothly and evenly. Probably not the ideal pen for
everyday notes, if that's what you have in mind."

hand, it’s not a big issue unless you hate glitter?.? The ink doesn’t smear
though as long as you give it enough time to dry. "

Filled it with Pilot Iroshizuku Ama-iro. Writes beautiful sky blue. Maybe due to
the nib size, wasnt able to see any shading. Smooth writer on Rhodia 80gsm
paper, abit of feedback and feathering with normal copier paper.  "
charlybu,"December 10, 2015","This is an absolutely fabulous pen. The fine is very close to Japanese fine
standards, this is probably pretty close to a medium in the Pilot Metropolitan,
maybe finer. Not a super wet writer, so it will play better with Molskein and
other lower quality papers. This pen is extremely well behaved and easy to use,
clean, take apart. Great for drawing,too. And it's great to show off to your
friends who have no idea what a piston filling fountain pen is. This is quite
possibly the best piston filling pen in its price range, if not well beyond its
price range."
kristine.frey,"June 27, 2016","Didn't know TWSBI, and got it because I was curious–lots of comments about the
amount of ink it holds and its ease of use. I've not taken it apart, but I
filled it with some ink I had just purchased elsewhere, and it's a dream. Wrote
immediately, and it's now one of my most reliable pens."
jpmellojr,"October 9, 2015","This is my second TWBSI pen, and I love the quality and consistent smooth flow
of ink from fill-up to fill-up. I had a problem initially drawing ink into the
pen, but it went away after I reduced the rate at which I rotated the piston.
Pausing every half-turn improved the intake of ink. These are great pens for
writing every day."
elliottcourtney92,"September 1, 2016","I love this pen. It's a very smooth writer and I like the demonstrator body so I
can see the ink levels clearly. It can be messy filling it since it is a piston
filler, but that's just my desire for things to be neat over anything. I'm very
very happy and I can't wait to get another in a different nib size!"
Howard Roark,"April 13, 2019","This is another great pen by TWSBI. A piston filler for this price is
ridiculous. It is well made and unpretentious. The modular construction is great
for people who want to clean and tinker with their pens.I like the size, but something a little heavier would be nice. It is a wet
writer with a true fine nib and only feels scratchy on cheap paper. I was
tempted to buy this pen in several colors and nibs, but the bigger brother 580
also beckons to me."
Daniel.doggett.jr,"May 18, 2018",Love it drove over the rockies and it did not leak like you parker does
exa.mendezg,"January 22, 2018","The pen is smooth and much more sturdy than I thought it'd be considering that
it is acrylic. The fine nib is definitely not as narrow as other pens,
especially the Japanese ones. My pilot metropolitan fine nib is definitely much
finer than this one, but I still love it and I think this is a beautiful pen.
You can see the color of each ink you put which makes you feel like you are
using a different pen each time. In love with it. "
nebulousphantom,"July 1, 2021","My first fountain pen, acquired about a year and a half ago. I'm really glad to
have picked this one; it's easy to use and maintain and works really well. I did
think it was a German pen for some reason, so I bought it in Fine rather than
Medium, but I don't think the line is too thin. I haven't cleaned and maintained it as often as I should have, but it doesn't
seem to have sustained any damage at all. Recently while cleaning the barrel in
warm water, it unfortunately split a little near the tip where the nib and
feeder are inserted, but there's no leakage. Heat seems to cause stress on it,
so be careful submerging the plastic components in water. I believe this was my
bad, so I'm not counting it as a mark against the pen.Would happily buy another fountain pen from TWSBI, either another one of these
or one of their more expensive models."
pattybarden,"August 6, 2020","Just getting back into fountain pens after over 55 years. I like this pen. It's
not heavy, the grip is good, it's easy to fill, and the nib writes smoothly."
Rena V,"December 5, 2019","Exceptionally nice pen. Writes very smoothly, easy to fill, feels substantial in
the hand, looks sharp. "
kymdacrazy1,"August 20, 2019",Still getting used to the nib but it writes super smoothly. I like it a lot.
Eliza,"May 14, 2019","Absolutely wonderful. The black and silver compliment each other very well, and
it's so much prettier in person. Every time I use it, I have to admire it a bit
before I stop writing!Very smooth writer in this price range, and the piston filler is super neat and
is great for writing a bunch. Honestly, for the price, I think you can't really
go wrong with this pen. There are studier, fancier pens, but I personally don't
think there are any other fountain pens that give you as much bang for your
buck. Some people complain about cracking, but I own three TWSBI ECOs, and none
of them have had any problems. Highly recommend! "
Susan,"August 29, 2018","This is a beautiful pen. But the knob that controls the piston for filling the
ink is not protected by a cap. If you grab this the wrong way or unthinkingly
twist the top of the pen while it's full of ink, you will have a horrible mess.It writes a treat with a smooth feel and is a comfortable weight in my hand. As
I said, it's really a beautiful pen. It does look and feel like a more expensive
item.But this seems like a poor design that risks dumping ink. I would not buy
another one. I'm giving it three stars because the exposed knob may not be a
problem in actual use.  But Jet Pens does mention in the item details."
allrealelements,"May 5, 2018","I already own the Clear version of the Eco in a Medium nib, but I liked it so
much I went and bought the Fine nib. These pens are a ton of a fun for the money
and I have both with me as my daily carry. The piston fill mechanism performs
smoothly and the pen comes packaged with repair tools, should they be needed. I
love watching ink slosh around the inside, especially the Kon-peki that I have
in this pen. I don't plan on changing ink colors very often with this pen. It
holds a large volume of ink but consequently also seems like a pain to clean
out. I haven't cleaned it out yet though."
ceb.cnm,"February 3, 2018","I love this pen!  It is balanced, a demonstrator and writes well. The ink flows
well and evenly onto the paper. Very satisfied"
Christopher,"October 31, 2017","I love this pen so much! At first it wrote pretty scratchy but as time went on I

katmol91,"May 3, 2017","Nice pen. Easy to fill. Nib flows smoothly. Too big for my hands though, so it's
not totally comfortable. "
wingman301,"January 2, 2017","The TWSBI ECO is my first demonstrator, piston fountain pen. I could not be
happier with the pen. The screw top cap stays on well and posts nicely to
balance the pen for writing. Filling the pen using the piston system is straight
forward. Writing with the pen is a joy. The ink flows smoothly and the fine tip
nib is perfect for my writing style. At this price you would be hard pressed to
find a better fountain pen. I'm very happy and highly recommend the TWSBI ECO. "
Nord,"December 28, 2016","Tremendous pen for the money.  Incredibly smooth writing on any type of paper
and the ink reservoir holds a lot of ink. Anybody looking for a feel-good
fountain pen shouldn't pass this one up."
stapletron,"December 12, 2016","Wanted a pen for everyday use, and I really like TWSBI for their interesting
designs. This is such a nice pen for the price. The fine is quite smooth, and
has always had good flow for me. I've only tried diamine Oxford blue so far,
looking forward inking it up with something else. "
karenpascual48,"August 30, 2016","i love to use this pen for everyday use. This pen is not scratchy and writes

Paula,"February 5, 2016",This fine write a very fine line. Nice pen.
dpeasterly,"November 30, 2015","The ink flow is a little uneven at times, but the pen holds a good amount of
ink, is easy to work, and the pen is a good value for what you get. My only
challenge is that it's easy to move the knob at the end a little when posting
the cap."
jodisports,"November 13, 2015","My TWSBI is amazing! Smooth writer right out of the box. Filled it with Parker
Quink, Pilot Iroshizuku Asa-Gao, and most recently, Monteverde Turquoise and all
are great. My only two complaints are that the top of the cap where the red
TWSBI logo sits cracks easily, and can cause the little guy to fall out (though
it doesn't affect the actual mechanism itself), as well as the piston
rod/plunger get stuck inside the mechanism frequently during disassembly,
requiring tweezers to pull it out (even when greased). Otherwise, it's a great
entry-level, piston filler, EDC pen! Perfect for a high school student!"

Silver Cruces,"May 2, 2022","An amazing everyday use pen. I bought it to see how much ink there is left in
the pen and it serves that purpose.  "
andrew,"June 10, 2021","This is, hands down, my favorite budget pen.  It holds well in the hand, it
flows well and it's easy to use.  The ink capacity is phenomenal, as well.  If
you've even wanted to get into fountain pens- this one is the one to try.  The
Pilot is great (even cheaper) But the nib is too broad for me."

pen."
valentinerobert63,"August 18, 2019","So far its great, no blots, fills with an amount of ink that may make it all the
way through a model drawing session, good range of thick to thin lines. So why
only third stars? This is my third artist fountain pen (and third brand). While
this is the best so far, the issue is whether the ink plunger continues to work
after 10 or 20 fillings. Both my other pens and a replacement mechanism refused
to create a vacuum causing me to go back to nib. Maybe I was using too thick
ink, (and I shouldn't deduct stars for that) but it is important for me to add
washes over line-work."
bboop25,"June 6, 2019","This pen is AMAZING. It's a great pen for the price: reliable, well made, and
holds LOTS of ink. I have found I also appreciate demonstrators because I know
exactly how much ink I have left."

JuliS,"November 3, 2022","This is my 3rd TWSBI Eco fountain pen.  I wanted a green pen and I liked my
other two pens from this line, so I got this one.  I didn't buy it for the glow
feature, which is okay.  I am a beginner and these pens are so beginner friendly
to use and hold lots of ink.  I like the Fine nib since it fits my writing size
and shows characteristics of my ink while still being legible.  I write on
Kokuyo Campus paper with 6mm lines.  My extra fine writes more like a 0.5-0.7
gel pen, better suited to smaller writing."
vobasak,"September 30, 2022","As always, the TWSBI Eco Pen is fabulous. I keep trying other pens and always

jason n,"September 30, 2020","Great pen. If you’ve had a twsbi you know what you’re in for. The section
has horizontal grooves in it and the are comfortable but the are oddly slippery
when rolled and satisfyingly grippy up and down the pen. The piston mechanism is
not as smooth as my pelikan but it’s effective and half the price, so....
Prussia Blue is the bomb. "
sportsaddict12,"July 6, 2021","I love the writing action of this pen. But even though it's listed as a fine nib
I do find that if held a certain way, the lines I write are more of a medium."
nikkimattei,"August 27, 2020","I wanted this TWSBI since the day I laid eyes on it! This is the most expensive
fountain pen I have bought to date and my third TWSBI and I LOVE this pen so
much. The color and design is so beautiful. The groves of the barrel feel nice
in the hand and the Pilot Iroshizuki Ink Asa-gao flows so well through the fine
nib. It feels weightier in the hand then the TWSBI Eco, which I also have, and
overall I love the high-capacity piston filling system. I enjoy watching the ink
swirl around in my TSWBIs."
Beautiful ink,"November 2, 2020","I must admit, I am a serious fanboy for Twisbi pens. I had 2 ECO-T medium nibbed
pens before purchasing this one. I love how the J. Herbin inks look in them. The
vibrant Emerald of Chivor and Amethyste de l'Oural just pop in those. This one,
with a fine nib calls for a different ink. I went with Noodler's Tolstoy.
Tolstoy has a bit more blue and white in it than the Prussian Blue accents but
doesn't clash with it. This nib is a bit more finicky, but smooth when you hit
the sweet spot. Though it is a bit scratchy when not in the sweet spot, for me
it has not failed to write immediately when I start a stroke. It is definitely a
step up from the ECO-Ts and feels it from the get go. Buy this in a medium and I
doubt you will be disappointed in quality or ease of use."
jetpens,"November 28, 2020","This is my sixth fountain pen I’ve bought, my favorite so far. I love the

wonderful daily writer! "
kait,"January 3, 2022","Amazing. This is my first twsbi, and I was a little bit worried since I have
gotten accustomed to Japanese nibs with 2 Pilot preras. This is my most
expensive pen and I would say it was worth it. Jetpens proceed and packed the
order in a matter of hours after I ordered it and I recied it in about 3 days
from all the way across the country. The pen itself now used a pilot iroshuzuku
Asa gao ink, and the ink capacity is huge. It writes incredibly smooth and the
grip is nice as well. I also like the quality of the packaging and the
maintenance supplies provided. This pen is now used daily. Highly recommend. "
finejeff,"February 25, 2021","This is my second one of these so I can have 2 inks on hand.  Nice balance of

problems.  I'm a left-handed printer and the fine nib gives me nice, tidy, all
upper-case letters just as I like.  "
foxdenfarms7,"September 7, 2022","Great pen. Have 7 styles of TWSBI’s and the 580 is my absolute favorite of
them. The Iris is stunning. This pen had been on my list for a long time. No
disappointments except for the color. Expected it to be blue, it’s not. Held
it in my hand while comparing it to every ink I could find that matches it.
It’s teal. Which is one of my top three colors. Some colors that match almost
perfectly, j. Herbin emerald of chivor, Diamine aurora borealis, Laban hera dark
green just to name a few. So the color is alright after all. "
Dollchuu,"June 26, 2022","This is my very first fountain pen. And I do not regret my choice. It is
beautifully crafted, the color is mesmerizing and the smoothness of how it
writes is just *chefs kiss*. It also doesn’t hurt that it’s one of my
favorite colors so I couldn’t help myself. You can’t go wrong with this pen.
TWSBI sure puts effort into their design and quality."
Tarbops,"April 14, 2022","Amazing Pen! I love every minute of writing with it!  I love its weight, however
its not so heavy my hand hurts.  Me personally the grip section is way better
than the ECO, due to its metal machining.  Amazing pen for the price and writes
with some feedback.  I love the demonstrator body so I can see exactly how much
ink I have left.  I personally loaded it up with noodlers V-Mail Midway Blue and
the combination is gorgeous! If you want a piston  fill pen, spring for this
one."

Jake,"January 9, 2023","This pen is absolutely gorgeous in person and writes as you would expect it to.
I love the packaging it came in and was well secured by a little tape on both
ends and held down by clear brackets that slide into a post keeping it in place.
You get a wrench for should you need to apply any barrel grease, mine came with
it alongside the wrench tool, for making the action on the piston smoother if
you need it. I have this alongside the TWSBI Diamond 50ml ink bottle and it just
works as you would hope, nice and simple and even someone like me can figure it
out. I love the TWSBI fountain pens and I highly recommend anyone who is
thinking about them or owns other pens to have one in their collection :) this
pen is a beautiful Prussian blue and didn't have any machining flaws or oils. I
always clean my pens before their first use but you don't need to it's just a
routine for me to make sure I'm getting a good flow through the nib and feed.  "

looks awesome. Like a spaceship of ink."
Finn The Human,"January 6, 2022","This is by far the worst fountain pen I have ever used!  TWSBI markets it's pens as being able to disassemble, which is part of the
reason why I got it but disassembling this thing is a nightmare! The included
wrench doesn't even fit unless you really jam it in where the piston is and it
is near impossible to take the nib and handle off! I had to use a pair of pliers
and scratch a small amount of the finish off before I could take off the nib and
handle, and putting it back on again is just as horrendously difficult
especially since the handle doesn't want to come on the same way and it's all
lose. So while this pen feels great I'm the hand and writes really well, the pen is
fidgety as hell and the quality is pretty bad. It makes a nasty creaking noise
if you try to disassemble it and I felt like I was going to break the pen. You can do much, much better for this price. "

BruhBruhsterson,"January 25, 2015","It pains me to give this pen a 4 star rating. It deserved the full 5 stars, that
is when it wrote. When I first bought it it wrote wonderfully, the tip was super
small, great for taking notes, the ink was vibrant and smooth. Ive had these for
about three and a half weeks, and they just stopped working. The ink barely
flows anymore, and the worst part is that there is half the ink left inside.
Great...when it actually worked"
lian.tiffany,"February 24, 2011","I thought that this 0.28 tip was a little bit scratchy. I ordered both the 0.28
and 0.38, and I have to say that I like the 0.38 better.  The ink flow is very consistent and the pen tip is just like a normal pen,
unlike the slicci which has a fairly sturdy tip and the hi tec c which has a
unconventional tip that looks nice and doesn't break unless you write extremely
hard.  I would say that this is a good pen for people who want to write small, and is
definitely better than the hi tec c 0.25 tip, which is tedious to write with.  Either way, I probably won't buy this again, due to the scratchiness, but it IS
a nice pen and is recommended for people who like very thin lines and dont mind
the slight scratchiness as much."
j.fewkes,"January 10, 2013","I bought one of the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 .28 tip pens whilst visiting in Japan
last year, but didn't try it until I returned to England.  It was  brilliant -
fine smooth consistant line enabling me to get lots on a page when making notes.
When the ink ran out I found I just couldn't get the same pen in Britain and
hunted on the internet until, I found Jetpens. I ordered both .28 + .38 tip pens and also refils - a little apprehensively as
they were to come from the USA.  My order and dispatch were both acknowleged by
email and the items arrived safely within 10 days. They are absolutely identical
to the one I bought in Japan. I'm highly delighted."
sh2oucair,"April 15, 2011","Awesome awesome awesome! I bought these because of the fine tip, and was
concerned about spending a lot of money on refills (reviews have said that the

pen."
bugscottiebug,"April 1, 2011","I liked it a lot until I got desperate one day and tried to use it to write on

least I can use the ink to refill my .38 Signo."
wendellp,"March 3, 2015","I've had a black Pilot Hi-Tec-C 0.3 mm for a few years and have endured its
extremely unreliable ink flow and scratchy tip. I decided to give this one a try

Comparing it side by side with a Signo 0.38 mm pen, this 0.28 is not at all more
scratchy."
slewis,"October 27, 2021","this is hands down my favorite pen for everyday use. It took me a while to get
used to the small tip size, since before this my usual size was 0.38 so it felt
a bit scratchy at first,  but once you figure out how to write with it, the ink
flows SO smoothly and works great for my small handwriting! The ink does run out
faster than some other pens, but a single cartridge still lasts me months, and
that's with me writing a LOT. I even use it for some art projects because it's
waterproof and I can paint over the lines without it smearing even the slightest
bit. A+ pen 10/10"

day my last pen pooped out was a sad, sad day indeed. I'm a writer, and I often
daydream about this pen, about the soft and gooey scratch it makes when you
write with it--there's an indescribable cleanness and fineness in that gooey
scratch that I've never found in another gel pen, try as I have. I love, love,

to work in paper.  In a typical case, I print out the relevant laws for my

is perfect for the fine-point writing that I use for tabbing and for note-taking
in and around dense passages of legal materials.  It's impossible where I live
and work to find such stationery.  I certainly plan to continue using this pen

Endlessly Ballpoint,"September 5, 2022","I have found this pen to be a very reliable drawing tool. The flow is
consistent, and the lines are fine and uniform. I have already bought a few

come for hatching in drawings. Works excellent."

maureencovert,"January 16, 2021",Great pen. The small nib is perfect for the line work I love. 
rmgalardo,"January 8, 2021","I love this pen so much and the fact that you can order refills instead of
buying another pen is worth a star alone.  This ink is smooth and always writes,
the .28 tip never skips (not once!!!) and is a real workhorse.  This is a go-to
for anyone wanting to take advantage of their predilection towards small writing
and an inexpensive one at that."
meltipp,"December 1, 2020",This is a great pen
Meili,"October 28, 2020","This pen is okay. Due to the size its pretty scratchy and maybe I got a dud but
it skipped on me a lot. I never bought a refill for this and I don't plan to.
Maybe in the future I will test a larger size of this pen and see how I feel,
but for now I think I will stay away from the Uni Signo line, as every pen I
have tried from them has skipped."
lynnsonu,"October 3, 2020","Writes so well! There’s just a little smudge when highlighting, but otherwise,
it’s amazing and currently my favorite pen. "
garrettwgg,"September 27, 2020","This is as good as it gets when it comes to this fine a tip. Yes, it is
scratchier than the 0.38 (which IMO has very little scratch) but I can't blame
this pen for it. Best you can buy if you write small."

steven.a.bennett21,"May 12, 2020","Bought this to write Chinese characters on narrow lines (Muji A5 spiral NBs). I
usually use Pilot V5 precise but those were too thick for some characters. These
work great—I have great control and enjoy writing with them just as much as I
do with the V5s. Only qualm is I’m almost out of ink after a week! "
Ava Jarvis,"May 1, 2020","Love this pen; great for writing Vietnamese, even though Vietnamese uses Latin
letters—multiple diacritics and such on letters means that an extra-fine pen
is useful for clarity."
ibebedear,"April 13, 2020",I use this for the outlines on my watercolors.
Arthur,"March 1, 2020","I was - and still am - a big fan of the Pilot Hi-Tec-C, so that's my point of
reference for this pen. Having run one of these Signo's dry, I've been pretty
pleased. The line size on the page is a bit thicker than an equivalently sized
Hi-Tec-C, but that's about the only complaint I have. It performed quite well.
Surprisingly, the cartridge even fit the milled aluminum body I have for my
Hi-Tec. If you like the Hi-Tec-C, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the Signo.
Another great option to try out!"
denitachanette,"February 11, 2020",love this pen for very detailed work
jolyneduong,"February 5, 2020","The ink flow is very inconsistent and scratchy. I think it’s mainly due to how
thin the tip is. I still that the brand of the pen and the formula of the ink is
great but not the tip size. The smallest I’d probably go for is 0.38"
ellingtonb2362,"September 1, 2019",I love the way these pens write and the colors. 
Tim B,"August 1, 2019","Great pen. Can be a tad bit scratchy at times, unlike the 0.38mm and up, but not
often enough to bother me. I write very quickly, so I imagine it's me."

satisfaction, will be purchasing again."

diana.christofersen,"February 21, 2019","This is an excellent pen, normally. As other reviewers have noted, there has
been a bad batch-- three of which, sadly, I ended up with in my current
purchase. The pens each wrote well, briefly-- then seized up and became scratchy
and essentially stopped writing. I've been meaning to contact jet pens and ask
for a couple of free refills but haven't bothered."
Karin,"December 14, 2018","Very early days, but I love this pen. It's got a super fine line, it carries
smoothly over both kinds of paper I've tried, and it's comfortable to hold. I'm
glad I bought some refills to have on hand! Now I want to buy many more of them,
in a number of colors."
Salmagundi,"December 8, 2018","Inconsistent. Purchased two of these along with a replacement box, based on recommendations. In the beginning, for a few months, the ink flowed beautifully—especially on
pads/notebooks from Rhodia and Moleskine, as well as watercolor and printmaking
papers. There were no faults to be found in either the pen, or the ink
(including the replacements). After a few months, however, one of the rubber grips on the pen hardened
completely, while the other became too sticky (although they were kept in the
same case). And, a few of the replacement inks didn't work at all, while others
did. Would still recommend to purchase, keeping in mind that there might be some
inconsistencies. "

mariainc,"July 19, 2018","The Uniball Signo .28 has smooth, railroad-free ink flow that dries even quicker
than the Pentel Energel, in my opinion. My main problem with this pen is the tip
size. When next to each other, this pen’s writing is larger than the .3
Energel; it is not truly .28. The smaller tip size is one of the main reasons I
purchased this pen, but I probably would buy this again since the ink is high
quality and dries quickly. "
niquey,"July 16, 2018","I loved the Pilot Hi-Tec Gel pens for years and that was all I bought until the
ink began drying out in the pens and I no longer wanted to buy pens that cost so
much and I couldn't use because of the ink problem. I tried Uni-ball on a whim
to see if they were as good as the Pilot pens once were and was very happy with
them. The ink runs out fast! So I purchase about 10 at a time. But they are the
only pens I like writing with now. "
Kay Gonza,"June 20, 2018",Very good fine pen.
Chris,"June 18, 2018","Good solid feel and well made, although IMO the black ink isn't quite as dark as
some others I've used, particularly the EnerGel in 0.3. This is true even after
accounting for the slightly different tip thicknesses. "

truslide,"November 16, 2017","I love the uni signo pens line, the style fit is my favorite, but I wanted
something that was thicker and also had some grip. I got this and the RT1. I
give this one 2 stars here because the pen blots ink when I write. I don’t
press hard when I write with fine tip pens such as this, but I’m relatively
disappointed. I wish I’d have gone ahead and ordered a refill because I
don’t want to pay for a refill and shipping just to replace the ink stick to
see if it was faulty. I’d recommend the RT1 over this, unless the one I
received was faulty. I’m sure, for other customers it doesn’t blot, and if
that’s the case then this pen does write comfortably and beautifully. I’ve
also used the zebra 0.28 emulsion and gel ink, and Mitsubishi GETS IT RIGHT with
the signo gel ink.  Highly recommend the style fit or RT1 > UM-151"
jtadcock,"October 19, 2017","Very fine, consistent performance.  Nothing special. "
abeerSaleh,"October 18, 2017","I was in love with this pen for how fine it is and for the comfortable grip, but
after a week of using it sparingly it stopped writing! I only wrote with it on
smooth paper and kept the lid on all the time! I tried everything I could using
hot water, steam, scribbling nonstop and lighting fire on the tip and nothing
worked even a little bit :( such a waste"
meeldredge,"June 2, 2017",If you like a fine line this pen is a beauty.  It is also very economical.
ricardusloganius,"May 13, 2017","I tell you... Never been a fan of finer line Pens.  I've spent most of my time
in the 0.7mm and 1.0mm ranges.  But my work of late has provided me a need to
try some finer lined stuff.  I bought this Gel Pen at 0.28mm and a Jetstream
0.38 Ballpoint, along with a Ohto 0.3mm Needle Point.  What I found was that
(surprise) the Jetstream 0.38 is my favorite of the 3.  This Uni Gel is my #2
favorite, while the Ohto lags behind.  I know the individual Refills have a lot
to do with this sometimes, but this is what I found.  This Particular Gel writes
pretty nicely.  Every once in a while it will ""Gum Up"" and I need to scribble or
let the Pen sit a bit.  Still, I like the writing this one puts out, and I do
think it will work well if you need a smaller line width.  "
onlyamari,"April 19, 2017","This has become one of my favorite pens! I write a lot, so in my few weeks of

stepvhen,"September 30, 2016","This pen is wonderful, but after about halfway through the ink would be harder
and harder to coax out of the pen. I had to move onto a new pen much quicker
than I would have liked. As I had the same problem with the Bordeaux color, I
believe it has to do with the 0.28mm tip. "

Forest Y,"April 21, 2016","My second-favourite gel pen! I like the 0.38mm one more because that one is more

this pen and I love the .38 RT version as well, this pen underwhelmed me.  I
could discern almost no difference in line size from the larger size of this
pen, and it actually seems to me that it writes a bit heavier than the larger RT

astra,"November 19, 2015","My favourite pen on this site! It writes so well, I can't live without it. The
only thing that I don't like about it is that it does empty up quickly (I use

quality trumps the amount of ink refills that I buy and use.10/10 would order for the rest of my life!"

performance drops dramatically as it ages. The flow goes patchy and it becomes a
pain to write with. Up until then it's wonderful. Too bad. "
anitatina,"September 15, 2015","Love the fine point and dark line this pen makes.  However, I must give it a
one-star rating because it's not waterproof as advertised.  I tried several
highlighters over this pen on tomoe river paper, and each time this pen smeared.

wanted to use this pen in my Hobonichi where I occasionally doodle and
watercolor, but I can't because it's not waterproof.  Very disappointed!"

jservi,"July 7, 2015","Like with the Pilot Hi-Tec C 0.25mm pen, the ink flow can get bad and the pen
can get scratchy sometimes in my experience. This one is significantly better
than the Hi-Tec though, probably because it is slightly bigger or maybe it's the
nib type. I highly recommend this over the Hi-Tec C 0.25mm if you absolutely
must have a pen with a nib at around this size. Otherwise I recommend the 0.38mm
version over this one."
rowann.gilman,"June 20, 2015","First, I am a paper freak. Second, I am a pen freak. When the New York Times
featured an article about these Uni-Ball Signo pens, I just had to have them,
even though I have more than three dozen pens from various doctors' offices,
press events, giveaways, etc.  Because of the write-up, I never expected Jet
Pens to have them in stock...but lo and behold, they did!!! And I do love these
pens.They've evenly and smoothly glided over every textured paper I have tested
them on, they're comfy in hand, and if you have nice handwriting as I do, they
can serve a multitude of handwriting needs. Go for them. They're terrific and so
is Jet Pens. ( I ordered many different colors.)"

sodakissed,"April 28, 2015","If I could, I would buy a lifetime supply of these pens because they are so
smooth and reliable. The ink never skips and the lines are so fine. I love them
to bits! The only complaint I have is that the ink does run out rather fast
because it is a gel pen (and probably because I use this pen almost exclusively
for inking comics and taking notes). Luckily JetPens also supplies us with
refills. Admittedly, I have a hard time unscrewing the tip and replacing the ink
cartridge. So I usually have someone with smaller, stronger hands do it (ie my
little sister)."

my best pen recommendation.Lots of artists use the Hi-Tec C, and I also used them for years...but this pen
is simply so much more smooth and consistent.  You don't have to press hard at
all to get good ink flow.  The tip isn't as sharp as the Hi-Tec C, which doesn't
create that scratchy feel.I use this pen all the time at work, with rough sketches and thumb nailing and
with my everyday sketchbook doodling.  A great pen for artists."

pen for math/science classes also where you want a fine tip for writing out
equations and reactions. I already notice writing out a recent lab in my
chemistry notebook it looks a lot cleaner with the fine lines and is easier to
read. I was also surprised for how fine the tip is I don't get a scratchy feel
from it when writing. Comfortable to write with also, not too heavy and not too
long or short. I also got this pen in 2 days so that's fast shipping and you
really can't find a better deal on a pen of this quality especially with the
fine tip. Only downside might be it doesn't have quite as many colors as the .38 but that
pen is great also. "
romevi86,"January 9, 2015","One of my favorite pens. Uniball makes some excellent commercial writing

namle2334,"October 25, 2014","Writes impeccably smooth, definately going to get refills for this pen"
romevi86,"October 1, 2014","A very fine pen--literally. It’s slightly smaller than my 0.30 pens, which is
the smallest I’d go for daily writing. I tend to have small writing, but going
with a very fine point size tends to warp and/or break the writing instruments,
especially since I tend to have a hard grip as well. As usual, Uni-ball makes a great, solid pen. Every one that I own of their line
is extremely durable, and this fine point pen is no exception."
romevi86,"August 19, 2014","This really does write puny. I use it to write in the margins of my Bible and
it’s perfect. But it’s so tiny that sometimes the writing comes out very

lauren.ciechanowski,"July 8, 2014","I definitely enjoy the Signo. I have two in .28 and two in .5 - though I have NO

sgoodwin4,"November 6, 2013","This pen is my all around favorite for industrial design sketching. Makes clean,
fine, sharp long fast lines on cheap multipurpose printer paper. Consistent.
Pretty resistant to blobbing. Black is really black. Decently comfortable grip.
Good balance. Cap is secure when on either end. Love the whole UM-151 line - 0.28mm, 0.38mm, and 0.50mm. The blue-black,
brown-black, and green-black are also great."
romevi86,"March 8, 2013","Most excellent. I needed a pen with which I can take notes in my Bible. As Bible uses onion
pages, they're very thin, and the text very small and narrow, so I needed
something needlelike to take notes, but that also wouldn't bleed. This pen fits perfectly. I'm able to take all the notes I want, and it isn't
scratch on onion pages as, say, a 0.18 is."
RestlessJim,"February 17, 2013","The Uni-ball Signo 0.28mm pens have become my go-to note taking and form-filing
pen. I love the super fine point, the great smoothness of the ink, and the feel
of the pen. I have been using these pens for college courses, where I have to
take complex notes in math and science. I have a selection of different colors
in this pen line, but I use the black as my basic pen with the other colors for
accentuating specific points or diagrams. I found that I prefer these pens to the Pilot Hi-Tec-C and Pentel Slicci lines.
The point has a much more sturdy feel while remaining very fine, accurate, and
smooth. "
bwaldo1,"December 29, 2012","I bought the .28 and .18  black versions of this pen on the recommendation of
the Penaddict.  I love this pen (.28).  And in my preliminary tests I prefer it
over the .25 Hi-tec-c. Has a nice feelin grip.  Writes in a nice smooth manner. 
I have not noticed any issues with ink flow.  And the small cap is unlike
anything you will find in the States. It snaps nice and tight into place.  Buy a
bunch of these you won't be disappointed.  For those considering the .18 it's
almost like a different pen, that extra fine nib does seem to have some flow
issues and feels a bit scratchy. "
rachi,"November 30, 2012","I love this pen! It writes quickly and smoothly, making clear, crisp lines.It's comfortable to hold even for extended periods of time. I do find that the
ink runs out relatively quickly if you're writing a lot, but refills are
inexpensive so it's not much of a problem. The pen feels very sturdy but thin."
stevedoxas,"June 16, 2012","WOW. I think I have a new favorite pen. And it happens to be purple.-This pen puts down a Tight. Clean. Sharp. Line. I have just tried out Slicci's
and Hi Tec C's, and the Signo is outperforming them.-Even more impressive, it writes very smoothly for a pen with this fine a point.
Definitely not scratchy. It blows the Sarasa, Hi Tec C, and Slicci out of the
water, in this regard.-Despite being smooth, it's still easy to control. My handwriting looks
amazing.-The pen starts writing great after the first word or so. After that, I only
notice it going out a few times (usually at the top of my e's). Barely
noticeable.-It has a wider barrel than most of its fine point competition, which makes it
more comfortable. The grip is nice, but still a little hard.-The Signo looks like it has a lot more ink than its competitors. I've written a
lot with it, and the ink level has barely moved. Compare that to my .3 Slicci
ink level, which plunges after every writing session. I could see this pen being too fine for some, but not for me.  And definitely a
pen for good paper, like Clairefontaine 90g.  I'm going to be buying a lot more
of these."
ksaardi,"June 6, 2012","A few notes about my writing style:I write quickly with a light touch and my normal print fits nicely on college
ruled paper.  I’m a righty and my handwriting is mediocre at best, so I tend
to choose finer point gel/ball point pens to help with legibility.  I don’t
use liquid pens because they tend to spew ink when I twirl them while I’m
thinking. I liked the Signo 0.28 very much for its fine point and comfortable form factor.
 It is a bit scratchy at first but as you break it in, that feeling goes away
and it writes a quite smoothly for an ultra-fine.  The quality of the pen itself
is superb but the grip starts a bit higher up than I would like, hence the 4
star rating.  The cap fits snugly on both ends and the pocket clip doesn’t
break even with moderate abuse.  I got about 40 pages of dense writing out of
one pen which is pretty much average for an ultra-fine gel."
artist_40k,"March 16, 2012","Fantastic pen for artists everywhere. I highly recommend both this and the Zebra
Sarasa (0.3mm)."
sulimeth,"January 20, 2012","I can't describe how much I like this pen. I have very small writing (a friends
once described it ""like a mouse writing with a pushpin dipped in ink"") and this
pen allows me to have clearly defined, legible, letters with no smudging. The
lines are thin and crisp without the pen feeling scratchy - a problem I've had
with other micro-tip pens like the Sarasa. It sits well in my hand, which pushes it over the Slicci in my opinion. Compared
to the Signo, the Slicci feels too small and slightly cheap. I've only had a few issues with this pen. Once the nib was bent at the tip,
making it unusable. This is my fault for rough handling. It probably bent when I
dropped it, or if I put it in a bag without recapping it. Secondly, one of my
older pens doesn't lay down as clear a line as it used to. It still writes, but
the letters look faded, like it isn't depositing enough ink. Still, gorgeous pen, I highly recommend it in any colour."
samohon,"September 11, 2011","I love this pen.  I have several in this size and refills to keep me going.  I
use it in art journaling quite often.  It doesn't write over acrylic paint very
well but if your using paper it works great.  You can write in a lot since you
can get such small lettering with it.  I write very large normally but with this
pen I seem to write smaller.  It's a nice change.  Would recommend to anyone who
likes a fine line."
tcleaves,"September 28, 2010","I just found the perfect pen for notetaking and charting (Nursing School)After my love affair with the Signo Bit 0.28, decided to give these a try and I
am now wondering ""what took me so long to order these"". I love the inkflow and
balance. just wish the cap was a little longer for asthetic reasons. All in all
this is the perfect pen for my needs. I am on my way to a box of ten right now!"
firecatstef,"August 25, 2010","I just bought eleven different kinds of pens and this is my favorite of the
bunch. I scarcely have to use any pressure to produce a consistent fine line.
Comfy to hold. My one concern is that when I store the cap on the back of the
pen it seems a little loose there."
cashoppings,"March 23, 2010","I have used .25 Hi-Tec-C's and .25 Pentel Slicci's. They're both wonderful gel
pens, but I think the Signo DX UM-151 is superior to both.  Although the Signo is not as slick as the Slicci, it has a thinner more
consistent line. The pen feels like a Hi-Tec-C but the tip of the pen does not
stick or catch on the surface paper like the Hi-Tec-C. The weight of the pen is
wonderful and does not feel too thin like the Slicci's and Hi-Tec-C's sometimes
do."
ben,"February 18, 2010","Favorite pen of all time. Sturdy tip. Always smooth. I do wish they made a
retractable tip, and that I didn't mow through them so fast. Near perfect."
mdubois,"January 21, 2010","The Uni-ball Signo DX UM-151 (028) has become my new favorite pen. I tend to
write small, with at least two lines of text for every traditional college ruled
line. I previously used normal 0.5mm pens, however the paper we started using at
the office apparently allows ink to bleed more than normal, and made my writing
difficult to read. I bought an assortment of pens from 0.18 to 0.5 mm and tried
them all out, with the Signo DX being the clear winner. The lines are smooth and
don't bleed at all on the page."
tomcheng007,"December 6, 2009","Best pen i've ever come across0.28 tip looks very clean, i'm sure it also holds true for the bigger tipInk is striking to see Note: put the cap on the other end when writing. Provides just enough weight so
you don't have to exert any pressure on the paper. You can experiment on that"
alvin2006lin,"October 12, 2009","I love these pens so much that I had colected all the colours! When I write it
was so smooth. My classmates also colect these pens! Fun! Hope to see new colors
coming out for sale soon... :)"
gisela5,"August 22, 2009","yowza! this pen is the best! ive fallen inlove with the .28mm! ive always been a
fan of uni-ball signo pens they carry in the US. but now im hooked on the .28mm
thickness. its the smoothest write youll ever have! no joke. the .38 is also
fantastic, but i like the .28 the best. im addicted!! (id trade my hi-tec-c 's
for this)"
zhanghaochi,"May 1, 2009","I first heard about the 0.18 mm pen, was rather curious, and then decided that
the 0.28 mm pen might be a more practical one for daily use. I purchased many of
these pens (and of different colors), and they are absolutely amazing. I've
always been sort of against gel pens from experiences with very ordinary ones in
the U.S. that don't have consistent ink flow and make a line too thick. I've
used this pen for many months now, and I absolutely LOVE to write with it. A gel
pen made right! Waterproof too! Thin, readable line, consistent ink-flow. I do
have to warn you that if you drop this pen on the tip, it -will- render it
non-usable (but you should expect that considering the tip is so thin!). As long
as that doesn't happen, this pen will last you a good while, and I recommend
this to anyone who loves to write small and write a lot! Very smooth! I even
ordered these as gifts for others!"
hartzog2000,"August 28, 2008","I like these pens. The ink is nice and black and goes onto the paper evenly. The
have a nice tapering nib that makes for a strong tip. They have a rubber grip
that is not to soft and feels good in my hand. The cap is short and when on the
back of the pen does not rest in the web of my hand. The pens have good balance
allowing for long writing periods.  The 0.28mm nib drags the worst of the 2 sizes but leaves the thinner line. The
0.38mm nib writes the smoothest but produces a darker line. The 0.38mm nib is
perhaps the better of the two as an every day pen. It writes as smooth as any
other uni-ball 0.38mm gel pen."
chenthebigot,"July 19, 2008","The best pen I have ever written with.The ink is smooth, and flows extremely well for a .28.The tip feels extremely sturdy, so I don't worry about pushing too hard or
anything.The barrel feels strong, and the grip is really nice as well.It's very comfortable to hold in one's hand.Overall, I can't wait to get some more of these! They will be my pen of choice
for a long long time."
ebbosto,"June 11, 2008","This is such a cool pen, I just love the way it works so beautifully. I have 7

jeannienguyen,"December 13, 2007","BEST pen ever. I love the way it writes so smoothly and it never skips or dies
up on me. I've used up a dozen of these pens within the past few months due to
school, and even though the ink goes fast, I will never ditch these pens."
busyfolder,"September 7, 2007","Black and Blue-Black in this pen have been my workhorse pens for the last year.
Being a student, I write many, many notes and so have gone through about 7
blue-blacks. Out of that I have had trouble with 2 pens. One never wrote well
and another stopped working half-way through its ink supply. Otherwise these are
excellent pens! I will continue to buy these pens."
ronmcvicar,"May 8, 2007","I have a simple review for the Signo DX .28 mm. The perfect field sketch pen,
stiff because of the tapered nib 'not a needle nib' responsive, dense and
vibrant, takes abuse and delivers the finest detail for illustrations and
sketches intended for reproduction. A pinnacle of balanced design. Five out of
Five. For the money you can't beat it on any front, no import or domestic pen
matches it's capacity for expression. FIVE OUT OF FIVE! Also the most
comfortable of the micro pens."
mayol,"November 3, 2006","I bought two of these while visiting a Saitama University recently. I am a pen

pens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
mayadesigner,"August 19, 2005","This is by far the best pen for artists looking for a instant dry extremely fine

Sophie D,"December 8, 2021","This is my favorite pen. Not just my favorite ballpoint... this is my favorite
pen of all time. I have several varieties of Jetstream bodies, and I love them
all. This body in particular has a really satisfying weight while maintaining a
sleek profile and comfort. The needlepoint tip is perfect in my opinion, as
well. It does not feel flimsy, and there is no rattling. I keep this on my desk
within reach at all times. "
clairifyit,"July 19, 2021","One of my favorite pens now. The smaller pen tip makes me slow down and write
neatly. The body is completely in balance. I love it!"
Bill M,"August 1, 2022","If it did not skip on most paper, I'd give it a 5 star rating.  I like the nice
grip, the way it fits my shirt pocket, the smooth writing, and that I can use a
0.28mm or 0.38mm tipped refills.  I do electronics, and I like thin lines on my
schematics and this pen fits the job.  The tips are smooth and work best with
the Midori 13804-660 journals and some of my more expensive lab journals.  Seems
the paper need just a bit more tooth than many papers made today."

Klaire,"July 3, 2022","Amazing pen! I gifted this to my Dad, and he was blown away by the point size.
He immediately began testing it, and the ink flow is flawless!I loved the satisfying click when you open the pen, and the unique clip was
definitely a nice change to the boring pens in stores. I would say the handle is
a bit fragile, but overall, it's a great pen!"
Mac7496,"June 22, 2022","Writes great with superfine point. Even works on coated papers like Rite in the

sierra.e.lomo,"June 10, 2022","The pen body is very comfortable and the fine pen tip is great for writing small

get stuck easily. It's not a big deal but is visually noticeable. They're too
small that I can't physically feel anything stuck in there. "

lyttletonfergusonjr,"March 13, 2022","I have loved JetStreams ever since they firsst came out. I was looking for
another one and I came across this one, so I decided to try it. I usually buy
the 1.0 pens because I love the bold marks I get from those, but this 0.38
version works just as good. The lines you get from this pen are rich, bold, and
smooth. No skipping at all. If you have not tried Jetsreams, try one; you will
not regret it!"

Neither warm water nor a few seconds in a flame will get it writing again.  How
are you guys getting yours to work??  I want it to work!!  I LOVE writing with
it...for 8 lines."
gavin,"September 26, 2021","Good-looking, decent knock, and comfortable grip with the reverse-taper body.Major downside: small refills. This pen uses the same refill size as a Pilot
Birdy, Hi-Tec-C Slim Knock, or some multipens.Also, the center of gravity is listed as ""low"". It is quite low - the back of
the pen feels like it's floating/waving around.Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars: it's solid. "

Mark Z,"November 10, 2021","It's nice when it works but the oil from your hands completely stops it from
writing. If I keep my hand on a certain spot of the page too long or put too
much pressure on it this pen will completely skip over that section of the page
unless you really scratch it in. However when it does write it's super crisp and
feels well."
foxdenfarms7,"August 26, 2022","What the vac700r wants to be. This pen is beautiful and writes superbly. The 580
series of pens are becoming my favorites. Got the extra fine nib and there is
plenty of perfectly balanced ink flow. Writes like my Sailor 1911s with the
Japanese 14K med. fine nib. Can’t give this pen enough laurels. The nib is
steel but something in the heat treating process must soften it somewhat because
it feels about the same as a gold nib where the feel of the paper is transmitted
to the hand. You will not be disappointed with the looks. Apparently they are
perfecting the process. It blows my 700 iris out of the water. If six stars were
possible. In my humble opinion you’re getting a two hundred dollar pen for
less than half price. If TWSBI ever figures out how to whoa down the quantity of
ink flowing out of there bigger nibs I would definitely buy another one. Hope
this helps someone. "
kompozishun,"August 23, 2022","This was both my first Extra Fine nib and my first pen over $50, so I'll admit I
was a bit nervous going into it. I had a Fine nib that was incredibly scratchy
and I couldn't write quickly with it (I do a lot of writing so time is of the
essence) but I decided to trust the reviews I read and boy am I glad I did. This
is easily my current favorite pen. Smooth flow even on lower quality paper, the
grip is more comfortable than I would've expected, and even unposted it has a
nice balance to it. My sole critique is that the piston can be a bit sticky, but
I'm sure with a thorough cleaning that problem will be resolved--I love how
TWSBI gives you the tools to properly maintain the parts. Overall elated with my
purchase, this is an EDC for me and I do about 3-6 pages per day with it and
have nothing but high regards. Plus it gets a lot of compliments "
kathrynammonstiles,"August 2, 2022","Did I need another pen? Another TWSBI? Technically, no. But I ordered it after
watching reviews on YouTube and I am so delighted with this pen!!! It is just
wonderful, a beautiful writer and a gorgeous pen. I love the EF nib. I have the
TWSBI Vac700R Iris EF Nib and the TWSBI 580ALR 1.1 Stub Nib and the TWSBI RG ECO

raegan.cross,"October 16, 2020","WOW, where to even start with this sampler pack. I was specifically looking for
fine tip pens as I have a smaller planner and I need to be able to fit a lot of
script into a small amount of space. This sampler pack gave me tons of new
options to explore! While I loved all of the pens, four of them made it to my
daily use pencil case, and the rest I have either reserved for my desk, or given
away as gifts. It's not that they aren't wonderful pens, it's just that the four
I use daily are more suited to my needs and personal taste. I have reviewed them
below: Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen - 0.38 mm - Black:     I will say up front, this is my favorite pen out of the pack. It is my
go-to pen no matter what I'm doing. The nib is sharp but not scratchy, I've
never had issues with ink flow, and it fits perfectly in the hand. It is the
standard by which I am judging all other fine tip pens from now on. Highly
recommended. Uni Pin Pen - Pigment Ink - Size 02 - 0.33 mm - Black:     This pen is definitely not as fine tip as I was expecting it to be. I think
that has more to do with the actual ink (which makes sense) than the nib. I
still love it specifically for art and doodling. It creates very strong,
pigmented lines and feels very soft as you write. Sakura Pigma Micron Pen - Size 005 - 0.2 mm - Black:     This was my first Micron pen having heard about them for years, and it did
NOT disappoint. This was previously my favorite pen in the pack, but after about
2 months of use, the nib got pushed back into the pen and it's difficult to use
now. I'm more than happy to say that that was user error, and I will be
replacing it. Incredibly fine tip, I think the smallest in the pack, and I found
out recently that they can be refilled! Platinum Preppy Fountain Pen - Black - 02 Extra Fine Nib:      I was very excited to have a fountain pen included in this pack, as I've
been interested in trying one but I definitely didn't want to make a huge
investment before I knew if I liked them or not. Again, not the finest nib in
the bunch, but the writing is so smooth and elegant. I don't typically grab this
for formatting a planner or calendar, or taking quick notes, but I LOVE it for
journaling. Writing with it feels very purposeful. If you are looking to explore new pen types, and you know you prefer a fine tip,
I highly, highly recommend this set. "
stikilley,"October 2, 2019","These pens are awesome. Some I will continue to buy as long as available.However, for a set of FINE tip pens, some ooze considerable ink and defeat the
purpose of their fine tip's fine-ness. So 4 out 5."
akira,"May 29, 2022","I'm someone who is alwys reluctant to use normal pens with permanent ink, but I
still thought I should get out my comfort zone and try these. I have never owned
or tried any of these before, so it was exciting. I usually use a 0.38 Frixion because I have super tiny handwriting that is
basically half the grid size of the Hobonichi. But one of the pens in this, the
0.25mm Pilot Hi-tec-c, was perfect for my handwriting size and it convinced me
to start using that instead. The ink may not seem to be as pigmented as the
other pens because of the size, but it's still definitely darker than Frixion's
black, and I'm very happy with it.  I was also surprised by the Preppy, because I honestly have never used fountain
pens before, and it wrote normally thanks to the ef nib as opposed to the line
variations I was used to seing with fountain pens. I enjoyed the thickness of
the barrel, since I also have joint problems and have difficulties holding onto
thin pens. The other pens were also great, and I'm glad I got to try them all. They
definitely helped me broaden my horizons.  "

icestreak,"July 31, 2018","My absolute favorite pen and the one I use daily. The pen is designed well -
nice weight, easy to hold, the cap to replace the parts is easy to remove but
never comes off accidentally. The design itself is elegant and not bulky which
is what I often dislike about multi pens. I use 0.4 black/red/blue/green in my
pen."
ADR in NY,"May 9, 2020","Update to my 12/10/2018 and 5/28/2019 review... it has been nearly a year since
my last update. I've been using this pen for a total of 17 months with my
opinion remaining the same... excellent writing instrument. The 1000 is simple
in function and design and appropriate for both casual and formal use. It comes
in several professional and fun colors. Its length is comfortable for small or
large hands. The lack of a transparent section to determine ink levels isn't an
issue if you're prepared to have a multiple of your favorite colored refills on
hand, something I highly recommend. Coleto refills are smooth and offered in
many rich, vivid ink colors and tip sizes. I have yet to come across a
relatively inexpensive customizable multi that surpasses this one. This black is
one of my favorite colored bodies with its matte finish, and the silver with its
metallic appearance. It remains a 5-star pen, and I recommend its purchase.
Would love to see Pilot offer hybrid ink refills in both black and blue."
Kendrick,"September 26, 2018","Best multi-pen I've ever used. The body feels solid and dependable (more so that
the 5 barrel version). I use it everyday and truly enjoy it more than any other
pen."
ADR in NY,"December 18, 2018","Definitely a step up from the N series. I have to say that I can, if I never
did, appreciate the transparent window in the N pen as it clearly identified
when ink was running low which is quickly depending on how often you use it or
how long when you do. However, given the more ""executive"" look of the 1000, I
wouldn't trade it in for any of the other lines. Can't go wrong with the Coleto!"
armada68,"November 9, 2018","Loads of fun!  I really like it.  Having trouble deciding which 4 colors to roll
with, but its a solid pen.  Pen cartridges go in easy and are held solidly... no
wiggling when writing.  And its not expensive.  What's not to like!"
neal.tambe,"October 10, 2019","Good weight, custom inserts (though who doesn't pick black, blue, green, red?
:)). Smooth body still has good grip."
miamorrison,"August 14, 2019","It is smooth, skinny, elegant and pleasant to use."
antonishodo,"June 6, 2022","A multi-gel specialist: This Coleto stands out as much for its sleek styling as
for the unique line of gel inks it takes. It’s part of a self-contained system
of some 32 pen bodies and 68 refills only compatible with each other. I compared
its black inks to those from Sarasa (NJK), Sliccies, Energel and Uni Style Fit
(UMR 109). Coleto held its own with a clean, dark line as well as smooth and
easy to control needle tips. The 0.3 in particular produced a noticeably finer
line than others in that size. With this 1000 comes a bit of luxury that is also very practical. A strong metal
clip, for one, plus a top cap that is easier to flip up to load refills or check
on remaining ink. The matte black finish stabilizes the pen in the hand enough
not to need additional surface treatments. The forward balance, due to the
metallic grip, helps to better guide the pen. A plain cylindrical shape makes it
very comfortable to hold. And because the nose is black all the way to the very
end, it sets off the delicate needle tips much better than the shiny metal or
transparent plastic common with other pens. This 4-component pen is the top model in the line - even though there are also
5-component versions. As such it feels slim but still very solid. Its grip
diameter is actually a bit smaller than the least expensive 5-component Coletos.
Yet, it weighs a gram more than a much bigger 5-slot Uni Style Fit Meister,
despite the Coleto having one less slot and no eraser (that’s with inks and a
pencil in both). Among the unique features of this ecosystem are the top-loading refills.  They
come with their own color-matched tabs on which the tip size is engraved. They
are easy to identify and even look sharp against the black of this pen. Another
unique aspect of the Coleto is that among its 15 colors is a white ink, the only
one of its kind for a multi pen. It is almost as opaque as a white Juice Up and
has the same 0.4 “synergy” tip. The line also includes an 0.3 pencil, rare
among multi pens, and very welcome considering all the fine tips that inks come
in. There are a couple of trade-offs for the top-loading design, however. First,
there is no easy way to hide an eraser at the top, so it is offered as an
optional (and rather pricey) component that takes up its own slot. Second, since
the clip is stationary, it can’t function as a tab for the pencil, as is
common in other multi pens. Thus the pencil takes up a slot alongside the inks
and its tab has been designed accordingly: It stands out like a giant beak (or
tooth?) to provide the necessary leverage when extending the lead and to clearly
identify it from ink tabs. It works really well - but also ruins all minimalist
intentions in the design of this pen! When it comes to ink properties, High-Tec-C claims to be archival and acid-free
but easily dissolves in water. Lines remain visible but give up some density to
make a thin “wash” overlay. This can be a useful feature or a major concern.
Looking to address the latter, I found that the Sarasa NJK refills compare well
to Coleto. Even though the tips are cone-shaped, they are similarly smooth and
come in the same three sizes. But, mainly, their ink is pigmented and resists
not only water but some waterless solvents I tried, too. These refills are
widely compatible with multi pens from many brands - except the Coletos of
course.  Overall, this Coleto is a beautiful pen that, to me, was well worth the big jump
in price for its useful features and good looks. But early on, I also tried the
cheapest in the line, a 2-color pen. The springs and tabs work just as
flawlessly as they do in the 1000. Nothing stands in the way of the
functionality of the lighter pen. It leads me to believe that this is a well
designed line, top to bottom."
JC Draws,"April 16, 2022","I've had this pen for just a few days and it's already my new favorite. It feels
very nice in my hand when writing, and the .5 ink cartridges you can fill it
with are exceptionally smooth and pleasant to write with. It feels nice and
solid in my hand, and the ink cartridges don't rattle/wiggle when I write which
is what I seem to recall being my least favorite thing about the multi-pens from
my youth. Also, it looks so sleek and professional! I think I'll get another
soon so I can have more colors immediately at my fingertips :)"
cltinseattle,"June 16, 2021","Best multi-pen there is, bar none.  At the time I am writing this review the
Coleto's come in three series: standard, 500, and 1000.  I also have the ""N""
series which apparently has been discontinued.  Within that, the 1000 series
come in five colors so this review is for the 1000 series, regardless of what
color you choose.  I have used the standard series and the ""N"" series and now
the 1000 series.  This definitely is the best of the Coleto's to date.  It looks
very ""executive"", does not look like a cheap disposable multi-pen and does not
feel that way either.  I know the specifications say the body is plastic but it
does not feel plastic, it feels solid - like a metal pen body.  The Coleto
refills are fantastic refills.  I use the 0.3mm as I like a very fine point and
they write consistently every time.  Occasionally you may get a refill that
gives you trouble with the clicky mechanism on the pen.  In my experience this
has been a problem with the refill and not with the pen itself.  I work in a
profession where I need to edit with blue, black, and red ink so I refill with
the traditional blue, black, red, and green colors.  It makes editing so much
easier than constantly having to switch pens.  I can't say enough about how much
I like this pen body.  If you work in a profession that requires multi-colors of
inks or if you just like multi-pens for fun, this is the best there is."
lonibeattie,"January 19, 2021","Very happy with this pen. Was able to choose my fav 4 colors from a wide
variety, and in a tip size that I like to work with. The body isn't too wide and
feels very sturdy and professional. The gel ink refills in 0.4mm size are
perfect for my Hobonichi weeks."
purledbanjo,"December 12, 2020","I've wanted to like multi-pens, but their fatness has always put me off. No
matter how amazing and awesome they looked, the big beefy barrel felt unpleasant
in hand and the pen would fall by the wayside. This pen body has changed my mind about multi-pens. Pilot has managed to create
in this pen a slim little rocket ship for ink. For my pen I chose Black, Pink,
Blue-Black, and a Pencil refill. It's the pen of my dreams. :DI'm using .4 refills and they work great in my Hobonichi's. They also work great
with Hobonichi stencils. The ink flows smoothly the instant it's put to paper.
It also dries lightning fast. The needle tip of the pen doesn't sink into the
paper and catch, which was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend these pens
and this specific Coleto pen body. It's sturdy and feels rather upscale after
you fill it up. "

ADR in NY,"May 28, 2019","Addition to my December 18, 2018 review... would love to see Pilot offer hybrid
ink refills for the Coleto, especially the black and blue. It's such a
convenience having different colors at hand without having to switch pens during
note taking. Since black and blue are primarily used when jotting down notes, it
would make better sense to have more volume of these particular colors. Wouldn't
mind seeing Acro ink refills for this terrific multi."

, the colors, the smooth way the ink writes( I use a 0.3 mm), and how well it
fits my hand.  I will never buy another pen again.  I set up mine with
red/black/green 0.3mm ink/ 0.3mm pencil."

mhand91,"August 24, 2011","This is a very nice pen.  The fine nib is VERY fine--was almost concerned that
it was too scratchy, but the ink flow is smooth and reliable and this pen is a
delight.  The fine nib requires very little pressure, but is fine/sharp enough
that it works on pressure sensitive paper.  The construction of the pen is very
nice--I bought Ivory, and it looks very sophisticated.  The clip works well, is
secure; good secure *click* with the pen cap.  This pen is a good value."
wncelectronicservice,"August 23, 2012","Just came in the mail...thank you, Jet Pens! One word...PENGASM! This pen is classy. Has the lines and appearance of a pen costing much more.
Reminds me of a Pelikan.  When capping, it seems be tight enough (air wise) that it slows you down and the
cap gently glides into place.  Buttery smooth nib. Japanese fine, so it puts down a very, very fine line for a
fountain pen.  I'm in love with this one.  "
Conchita,"December 9, 2013","First of all I just want to mention that the colour is not as light as it
appears in the photos.  It's more of an Ivory colour, not so white as in the
pictures. I had trouble as first using the Pilot Con-50 Converter thinking that it wasn't
working and not filling up, but it seams I just had to repleat all the steps
various times until all the air was removed and then I could fill it up with
ease. It writes like a dream.  It is just as fine as my Cavalier and I would actually
say it is even smoother.  My Cavalier was very scratchy at first, took me a long
time to break it in.  This one wrote smoothly from the first moment it hit the
paper. I'm using it with the J. HERBIN 1670 red ink which is lovely, but I can't quite
get the nib to stay clean on the front.  It's continually stained which I don't
like.  Perhaps with time it will not be like that. That's just a little quirk of mine.  As far as the pen is concerned, it is very
elegant and most importantly, it writes like a dream and I'm a left-hander!!! The service was wonderful again as always.  Thank you Jet Pens!"
patrick,"October 31, 2012","This looks like a great pen, but I want to add to the review above that Pilot
fountain pen ink is the best.  I've tried numerous brands and Pilot flows very
well, doesn't clog, and is, of course, very black.  The nib looks extremely
sharp for a fountain pen. I got the finest platinum nib for my Mont Blanc and
it's just not fine enough.  I'm hoping this will be better without being
scratchy.  By the way, the Mont Blanc ink was not as good as the Pilot ink."
hadaad,"August 1, 2018","I bought a Pilot Prera on a whim, as a mini-celebration for passing my probation
at work. I've paired it with Iroshizuku Shin Ryoku ink. I've been using it that
way for six months. I don't know if it's the ink or if it's the pen, or some
magical combination of the two, but it is one of the nicest writing experiences
I've ever had. The fine nib is exactly that, the flow is consistent, not running wet or dry,
and it writes smooth, but not smooth like you're writing on glass. It encourages
me to write more, and that is what I want in a pen. Definitely recommended!"
nmdusty,"April 4, 2018","Extremely good-looking pen for the price. Lovely ivory color, wish trim was a

posted since barrel is rather short."

of feedback when writing, so I kind of wish I got a medium. My favorite part is
the cap... Snapping it back into place is so satisfying. It feels like there's a
little air cushion when sliding it closed, and then it snaps into place. It's
hard to explain, but it makes me happy lol."

like it as a shirt pocket or jacket pen.Works well as an eyedropper pen and the cap snaps very satisfyingly. All in all
this feels more like a budget $15 pen while the Metropolitan feels a lot
sturdier. "
magnumformer,"May 8, 2021","The Pilot Prera is an exquisite writing companion for the day to day. Its

could not be happier with my choice. The nib is wonderfully fine, sitting
somewhere between 5mm and 7mm and it is deliciously smooth with even the most
delicate of paper. I have been using mine extensively with my Hobonichi Techo
and it is undoubtedly the smoothest pen I have used with it– even when pitted
against the likes of Lamy and TWSBI fountain pens. It is the first pen that has
urged me to write more simply because of how wonderful it feels to write with
it. A definite favorite amongst a quite extensive collection of pens. "

Clifton R,"December 19, 2020","I did not originally set out to buy this pen. I had been intending to buy a
Pilot Metropolitan, because that was one of the fountain pens highly recommended
for beginners. However after looking at all the different variants, I just did
not like the looks that much - something about the proportions put me off. However, looking at the Metropolitan led me to the Pilot Prera, and this looks
so much more elegant that I couldn't resist spending a little bit more for it.
It's very simple, but the color and lines are so clean it looks like it could
easily be a $100 pen.The Fine nib is great - Pilot nibs are fine enough that this is what a lot of
manufacturers would consider Extra Fine - and it makes a beautiful, consistent,
clean solid line. No blotting, no skipping, no complaints at all about it.Of the two new pens I recently got at the same time, I'm torn between
considering the Prera my favorite or the Kaweco Classic Sport; the Sport is
easier to carry and feels safe in my pants pocket, but I like the looks and the
feel of the Prera slightly better. At present it's sitting on my desk, where it's one of the first pens I reach
for, and when I wear a shirt with a pocket it's what I carry. Not so good with a
T shirt, though!"

using the Prera for a little over 3 years and have never experienced any issues
whatsoever. To my eyes, the barrel's color appears more of a cream than an
ivory; I would have liked a darker shade, perhaps a sandy or pinkish-brown
color. This fine nib is very smooth and lays down a consistent line. There's
neither hard starting nor skipping and always writes right away after uncapping.
Caps and posts securely. It remains an absolutely excellent writer and a great
pen for anyone's collection!"
rex.bristol,"February 11, 2021","I really like this pen. The form, fit, and function are spot on. From the fine

the clip that is perfect. I can't imagine how a more expensive pen could provide
any more bang for the buck."
Rick Davis,"November 4, 2019","I really like this pen. The nib is a little bit finer than the Pilot
Metropolitan fine but still very smooth. It does not have the heft of the
Metropolitan which can be nice if it is going to be in a shirt pocket. I would
not have this as my only fountain pen but it is a nice addition to the fleet.
The Metropolitan is still my go-to favorite but this pen gives the Metropolitan
a run for the money. "

far. Simple, elegant, love it."
bujo.doctor,"June 1, 2022",One of my favourite pens! So smooth and such a classic looking pen!
jaynezh2003,"June 1, 2022","Lovely pen. Writes smoothly. I love that slight bouncy and soft feel when the
nib moves on the paper. "
ldroddy,"May 19, 2022","I have so many fountain pens, and this is my go-to for work! Smooth and
satisfying, the weight is just right, love the quiet snap of the pen cap--it's a
really nice pen at a great price point. "
mftassano,"April 7, 2022","A nice pen, but much smaller than the Cosmopolitan I like. If I had known, I
would have passed. But much nicer than the TWSBI which turns in my hand."
mlacko51,"March 29, 2022","This is a beautiful fountain pen. You can't beat it for the price. I got the
fine nib which is so smooth and nicely fine. "
jdheung,"March 22, 2022","I adore this fountain pen. It's beautiful and the perfect size and weight for
me. The nib is great and the cap closes with a very satisfying click. "
Sky3,"March 18, 2022","This is my favorite fountain pen out of the affordable ones that I have tried. I
think the design is really simple and elegant looking. It writes really smooth
and allows for a good amount of ink flow. "
paulaquinn777,"February 24, 2022",Very nice pen. Plastic but pretty
genevievegeer,"August 11, 2021",Great fountain pen.
kiracoop,"July 27, 2021","As with all Pilots I have experienced so far, this pen writes beautifully:
smooth and with good ink flow. So, why only 3 stars? If you're using a
converter, not enough ink gets pulled into it. I'd love to be able to carry this
pen with me, but it holds such a small amount of ink, I'd never make it through
the day. Also the pen is designed for smaller hands, so I don't recommend it for
just anyone. For the money, you're better off with the Kakuna, which holds the
same amount of ink and performs just as well (IMHO)."
suissakatrina,"February 11, 2021","Great pen with an excellent tip. I would purchase again in a different color.
Only reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is that I like my pens to be a little
heavier. This one is just a little too lite in weight."
cleo mkathy,"January 26, 2021","I have bought many pens and to this date still love this pen. I have bought two,
in white and demonstrator pink. Kind of small in the hands (mine are 7inches
wrist to middle finger tip) but silky to write with, EF or F is a delight to
bullet journal. I think the convertor doesn't hold as much ink as i'd like a pen
to, but there is a way to bypass the awkward air bubble in refills to max
capacity this pen. Overall my favorite, despite its small inconveniences"
ladyoftheloom,"November 2, 2020",I love this little pen. It’s simple and reliable. The color is sophisticated. 
Received a USED pen,"June 6, 2020",Hard to write for a long time. 
rpiwonka,"May 14, 2019","This is a lovely small pen: perfect in my opinion. Ivory is a very pleasing
color; I wish the silver-colored metal fittings were perhaps gold or perhaps
even ivory. That said, this is not a fatal flaw, etc.My pen, with an F point, writes smoothly and beautifully. It is a joy in my hand
and on the paper in front of me."
ainsua,"November 3, 2018",Very good pen for the money. Precise nib and not scratchy. 
maruth27,"May 30, 2018","Small enough for my hands.  Would like to try the extra fine nib next time. The
fine nib I got is closely similar to the medium nib I currently have."
Conchita,"December 16, 2013","This is a second review of this pen.  I'm still very happy with the way it
writes and feels, but unfortunately for some unknown reason today when I took
off the cap to use it, ink went EVERYWHERE.  It was leaking badly!!!!  Ruined my
knew girafe onesy and all over my hands.  Looks really bad, like I've cut myself
in a bad way.  Red ink too!!!  I'm very disappointed that this has happened. 
Has this happened to anyone else?  Is there something I may be doing wrong.  Can
someone help me out please???"
ayuzyk,"November 30, 2010","Very pretty in person, nice smooth nib."
bobpost2,"September 1, 2017",it's O.K.
suebeecreations,"August 13, 2018","FANTASTIC pens at a reasonable price. For anyone looking for a great pen for
drawing, outlining or using with other media, these are perfect! They NEVER
skip, bleed or scratch. The nibs hold up to lots of abuse. The best part is the
ink is lightfast, so there is no worry when you want to add this ink to your
fine art. The ink is also waterproof when dry. Re: Jet Pens... Ordering was easy
and delivery prompt. LOVE their detailed explanations, tutorials & pics of their
products. Jet Pens is my go-to for all my art pen needs."
StephenBlyden1663,"September 27, 2019","Arrived on time and they're great. One complaint i have is sometimes the ink
stops working for a second or two then its back to normal. Im guessing its maybe
because of the paper I'm using or it could just be the pens."

highly recommend these for writing and drawing. "
sleightofmike,"February 10, 2022","I've been using Pigma Micron Pens since I was a kid (back when the dinosaurs
were still roaming the earth), and they are as consistent and reliable as they
were then. I would pay $2.00 per pen back then, and now you can get an entire
set for about half the price per pen in the set, thanks to JetPens!"
baruch,"October 6, 2019","I use the Sakura Pigma Micron Pen for technical drawings and watercolor art. 
The different sizes allows me to use them for different line weights and types.
I highly recommend them."
PandaSagoma,"October 3, 2022","I always love the Sakura Pigma Micron Pens for lineart! They always dry so
quickly but I'm able to get clean, precise lines for my drawings. I have tried
other line art pens and I thought others were better because of reasons - but I
realized that these are just the smoothest, quicker to dry, and easier to use
overall when lining!"
Renee,"June 20, 2022","Great felt tip pens, but I prefer roller ball so theres that and I think their
overpriced. I would suggest buying a none sakura brand for half the price if you

touch, no variation in thickness no matter how hard or lightly you press. I wish
they could somehow come in a click-top option also. That would be the ultimate,
not having to pull the cap off, set it down, find it and replace it again each
time you want to write something. Great for drawing, too!"

carladelrey,"December 16, 2017",Awesome pens. 
bad_humor,"July 26, 2018",Industry standard for a reason.
casuelles,"July 24, 2017","I didn't receive what I expected. This completely exceeded my expectations! I
absolutely love these pens! Sakura is one of my favourite brands for pens, and
these are by far my favourites of all their products! This is perfect for art,
and there are so many colours to choose from, it's heaven. I would recommend
this to anyone, especially those who love drawing in colour. And even if you
don't do art, this is still an important essential! It's just-- I don't know how
I /just/ came across these pens! Amazing quality, so smooth to use.. everything
is INCREDIBLE!! Plus, the design is so simple, but so easy to understand. For example, the caps
of the pens are different for each type. The solid colours are - you guessed it
- the solid coloured pens, which there are two different sets of, which you can
tell by the label. 06 or 08, 08 being the thicker one. The ones with the
glittery caps are the glittery pens, and I'm sure you could figure out the rest.
I use these pens for absolutely everything, from drawing, to DIYs, etc.Finally, for those who weren't bothered to read all of the above, here's a
pros/cons not-really-a-table : PROS:-Multi purpose. You can use this for pretty much anything, not just art.-Variety. So many types and colours to choose from.-Simple. Everyone will be asking where you got these pens from.-Smooth. Writing with these pens feels like eating pizza - it feels like heaven
(unless you're vegetarian/vegan/lactose intolerant. In that case, I admire your
strength.)-Durable. These pens are the bomb dot com. Yes, I said ""dot com"", because I'm a
rebel. CONS:-Price? I mean, it's definitely pricey, but it is *sooooo* worth it. Think of it
this way, each pen in the 74 pen set is worth less than a dollar -Too much variety. Sometimes, I'll spend ages trying to pick the perfect colour,
because there's so many to choose from. -Distracting. As of now, my left arm and leg are completely covered in doodles I
drew in my 2 hour class, because I brought these pens with me. And now, I have
to hope my friends (by friends, I mean the 2 or 3 people who are nice to me. I'm
a loner.) will let me borrow their notes. tldr; I LOVE THESE PENS I 100000000% RECOMMEND <3     "
20kg0881,"June 20, 2016","Love this set of pens. These are the best gel pens I have used. They are a joy
to use, no skipping, and the ink flows smoothly out of each and everyone of
them. Though the set of 74 is a bit pricey, it is worth it. If you don't want to
commit to buying the large set, buy the smaller sets or individual pens to try
them out. You are going to love them, I guarantee you. Thanks for reading"
mrdisco,"March 2, 2016",I have this set and it's a joy to use. The only downside is the price.
tweetkarma,"February 13, 2018","These pens are truly my most fave writing implements for art projects now. I
have not found any down-side to them...& I've used them a great many times & on
a variety of surfaces. I have to add that I am very satisfied with JetPens and
the promptness of their delivery (plus the fact that their price beat out...by
far!...any other price I found--& I was shopping on Black Friday!). I would not
hesitate to order again from JetPens. Thank you!"
Maggi,"October 31, 2020","I just purchased more Sakura Gelly Roll pens in individual colors. These pens
are wonderful, I've used them for years. I wanted to say if you live in a dry
climate with low humidity, such as we have in Arizona, these pens do not dry up.
I've had other brands that dried up or were constantly clogged & required lots
of finagling to get them to work. The Sakura pens do not clog too often & the
ink stays fluid. "
bailey.holland33,"February 10, 2021","This set is a dream! My favorite part is that the reverse side of the Gelly Roll

these pens have added another dimension of color and effect to my efforts.
(They're also a lot of fun to just write with!) It is a big decision on whether
to purchase all these pens, but if you hand letter, draw, paper craft, practice
calligraphy of any type, or simply enjoy writing with a variety of colors and
effects, this is a great set to add to your collection. It comes with a swatch
page that you fill in yourself, so you get a good feel for each pen and its
effects. This set might also be useful if you have older children (9+) and you
are home schooling due to the coronavirus. Have fun with it, and let your
imagination and creativity go nuts!"

hiimbeary,"October 5, 2016","Great variety, and I think it's a reasonable price given the price of Gelly Roll
pens in smaller sets - plus it comes with the sturdy storage box.  I would've
loved to give this five stars, but I have a small gripe on the silver/gold
shadow pens.  Namely - when the ink comes out, unless you lift the pen from the
paper deliberately, it will leave small trails of ink between letters.  Possibly
I got some defective pens but having tried all of the shadow ones, I can say
that all of the shadow pens in my box have that issue.That's pretty minor though, and may be a non-issue for some people depending on
your handwriting.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase."
tgdelb,"August 19, 2016","These pens are the best gel pens out there hands down. They are definitely worth
the price. "
serradrawsstuff,"May 19, 2019","I have other Pentel EnerGel pens but this is my first of this size (0.4). It's a
little thinner than I think I prefer, but that's just me. Otherwise the pen is
wonderful, the ink flow is really smooth, it's a dark blue that's almost black,
and of course the barrel is really stylish. This pen is going to be perfect for
some finer detail work."
chianneshops,"September 18, 2020","This was a great replacement for when my last pen died on me.  It's a very deep
blue, almost black!  It handles really nice, compared to my last pen.  While I

pen fits my hand a lot better. "

to purchase them in a few other colors."
gitlin.public,"February 27, 2021","i was looking for a pen with a very fine tip, but with good ink flow and without

brandocrawford36,"February 5, 2021","Bought this pen in various sizes and colors as a ""lefty test"" and they all
worked wonderfully.  Personally I preferred the scratch feeling of writing with

readable."

pineappleprincess3,"August 22, 2020","If you're already a fan of the EngerGel pens, this doesn't disappoint. I loved
this shade of blue, which I've never come across in stores. It's a very fine
tip, doesn't skip though. I'm glad I bought this you get to the minimum for
shipping!"
sara,"January 6, 2020","I really love the way the pen feels in hand when I write and the ink color is
beautiful as well. However, despite the description, the ink does ""blob"" a bit
when first starting to write with it each time. I do use it in a Hobonichi Techo
on the Tomoe River paper and in general I tend to like a 0.3mm tip. I will try
that tip size next time to see if that solves my problem. The actual tip of this
pen is more needle-like (similar to that of a Pilot Coletto) which I really like
using in the Hobonichi Stencils (vs. a V-shaped tip like a Sarasa). They fit
better in the little nooks. I normally don't like knock style pens but I really
like the tactile feeling of this pen."
tcline6290,"August 1, 2019","Great experience with this pen. The flow is much more smooth than the Pentel Hi

it comes down to that I am just not impressed by any clickable pens... not sure."

even though it originally came with the 0.4 mm ink tip. "
sharlopez01,"September 26, 2022","Too thin, skips and the handwriting is odd"
Emilie A,"September 20, 2022","I purchased three 0.4mm EnerGel Clena Gel Pens in March 2021 and was delighted
by the smooth flow of ink and the fine line. However, the body of the pen
doesn't stand the test of time. The body of the blue-black Clena pen developed
stress breaks and splits behind the finger grip, running vertically along the
pen. These were not caused by dropping or tightening the parts--neither thing
happened on my watch. I inspected the other two Clena pens and found that one of
the other ones (the brown ink one) has also developed a stress crack (which has
not yet fully split). The third, a red ink Clena, appears to be OK. Wish these
had lasted--I absolutely would have gotten replacement ink for them."
evrshops,"September 17, 2022",Best pen. Love how it writes. Ink is real smooth 
clairifyit,"September 15, 2022","I previously ordered the .5mm pen and felt the tip was too big. This pen feels
right and allows me to write smaller when I journal. I am not fond of gel pens
due to the ink; however, this pen has a nice rich color the does not feel runny.
The grip is lightly textured for ease of holding and hand comfort. I would
recommend this pen if you planned to write for an extended period of time. "

some flex to it and it could be the ink I'm using that it actually flows more
than the fine nib which writes with very thin to thick lines.  To save from
throwing away the plastic cartridge when empty, I just inject my favorite
iroshizuku ink with a syringe."
viviannerlw,"March 11, 2019","This review is long overdue. I took almost one year of writing with my Kakuno
before writing this, not because I didn't want to do this review or forgot about
it, but because I truly didn't know what to write.Pilot is known for the quality of their products for office and their high end
pens, but not so much for their children's focused products, so I was highly
unsure of what to expect when I bought my Kakuno.The nib is Japanese extra fine, which means, the finest fine isn't fine enough
to describe how fine this nib is, but unlike my expectations told me would
happen, this pen glides over the paper, butter smooth like very few pens I've
owned over the years (yes, it includes ballpoints and rollerballs in this list).
It sure is far away from being anywhere near wet too, maybe the medium or broad
will be, but seeing from the extra fine, I can almost be sure the fine nib will
be equally dry.The triangular grip takes a little getting used to when one isn't used to it,
but it's very comfortable and in no time it feels natural to just hold the pen
like it guides you to do. It doesn't have any sharp edges and the area near the
nib has a small and comfortable slightly rounded stop so the fingers doesn't
slip down.The hexagonal body prevents the pen from rolling everywhere and the cap, when
posted, makes it even harder to happen.Only thing this pen misses is a clip, but, in my sincerest opinion, one doesn't
even miss it if they think that this pen is supposed to be carried in a
pencilcase to school.This is a well deserved five stars!"
Lemonstrudel,"February 7, 2018","The thinnest line you can get on the best starter fountain pen! The Kakuno is a
solid pen: lightweight and comfortable with a slight hexagonal barrel. The cap
clicks on tightly and posts well. The only thing missing is the clip, though it
has a tiny ledge to keep it from rolling away. The Japanese extra fine nib has
some feedback which is to be expected but it writes very well with no skipping
at all. Although personally I prefer the fine nib since it's smoother while
still providing very thin lines, I am pleased as punch with this pen and
especially love that it comes in a clear version!"
j.wally.schweitzer,"June 18, 2018","I really like this pen. Holding up well. I've left it in my car on very hot days
and no leaking or burping. I don't know how many times I've dropped it on to
hard floors. Fortunately not on the nib.Light weight.No skips.Hasn't dried out after two weeks of non-use.The cap fits tight.Posts well.No clip is not a problem for me.My one reservation is that I forgot how fine the Japaneses nibs are. I may have
to get another with a fine nib.I like this pen."
karenmathison,"October 12, 2018","I love these pens!  They are a delight to hold in your hand; very balanced.  The
nibs write smoothly without skipping; it's very fluid across the paper.  My only
problem is that because I love them so much, I wish they had a more elegant
looking pen, as these are very common (boring) looking.  Maybe that's a good
thing because no one will try to steal it from me...lol! "
lynnewarren,"July 9, 2019","Wow! When Pilot says “Extra Fine,” they mean EXTRA FINE. Perfectly smooth
right out of the box. Love the Kakuno, and the clear version is just delightful
looking. Feels so light and easy in the hand, and writes without even a whisper
of pressure. Extraordinary pen for the super-modest price. Recommend very highly!"
Nyanya Panyanyan,"September 6, 2019","This cheap plastic pen is way better than my other expensive pens that I owned.
It can even handle frickin' Noodler's ink on those crappy notebooks u get from
Walmart during back to school. On cheap copy paper no bleed through and no
feathering. Buff the thickness to 28 lb and u won't see it on the other side.Nib size is small and gives a nice scratchy noise when writing, very satisfying.
Flushing is simple and easy. Just take it all apart and clean it. The
transparency is gorgeous. U can write without posting, but posting will make it
a lot better and u don't loose the cap. Very sturdy and won't break unless u
really want it to. I'm guessing the reason why this pen is soo good 'cause they made it for kids,
and we all know how good they are at destroying things."
AprilP,"January 11, 2020","The finest drawing nib I've come across.  In fact I think this is better than
the Platinum Preppy - somewhat smoother nib. Very comfortable for long stretches
of drawing."
Jake,"April 3, 2018","This simple fountain pen is an excellent choice to have as a first fountain pen
as a child or an adult. It just works and the triangular grip section is
intuitive to grasp correctly. The only drawback is the lack of a pocket clip for
carrying in your shirt pocket."

penSquid,"May 22, 2022","I added a Kaweco sport clip to this.I write and draw with this pen all the time with Platinum Carbon Black and it

writing and I wish it were finer."
gmissonis,"September 12, 2020","Works well, but the nib is a bit scratchy compared to a Platinum Preppy. 
Originally hoped to use it with eyedropper refiling, but will likely just refill
the cartridges as much as possible."
artichoke,"February 7, 2020","An awesome pen. It brightens up my day when I uncap it and see the happy face on
the nib. I find the hexagonal shape very comfortable to hold. The shape and
small tab on the cap also keep the pen from rolling off the table. I like that
you can use the CON-70 with it. The extra fine nib is very fine, which was what
I wanted."
Skye,"December 27, 2019","You ask me, ""what pen to get?""  Well, this is it! !  I am an artist who has been
playing with fountain pens since the '90s.  And Pilot brand delivers!  I never
buy high-end pens because I mostly throw them into a sketching bag and don't
care if they get scratched.  That being said, these Kakuno pens, especially with
extra fine tips, are the best bang-for-your-buck pens EVER!!II have NEVER found a fountain pen to honestly deliver an extra fine line like
this pen!! EVER!!!And I own about 10 of these pens now.  They work great with con 70 converters
and the converters take up most of the pen and make it look great! (Albeit, you
have to buy con70 elsewhere).Overall, this pen, especially in an EF is more than excellent for your
collection!  If I had one pen to ever own, this would be it."
Rotsterne,"March 7, 2022","I recommend these fountain pens to anyone who's interested in trying fountain
pens because they're well made, easy to clean and to learn on, and don't break
the bank. Plus they won't spoil you the way the Preppy does. I buy a lot of these because I like to have a lot of pens with different inks in
them, usually around 10-12 at a time. I write a lot, so they don't get much of a
chance to dry out, but if they do, they're very easy to clean - usually plain
water does the trick. These seem to have much less scratchy nibs than the Pilot Penmanship fountain
pens, while still giving a nice fine line, thinner (by maybe half)  than any
Western extra fine nib. For that reason, I will continue to buy these."
karenmathison,"December 24, 2018","I love these pens!  The write smoothly and evenly without any blobs ever!  I
have ordered several in keep them wherever I write, on my desk, my bedstand, in
the kitchen, and in my purse. "
wwaldmanmd,"December 4, 2022","great pen though i should have looked more carefully and seen it does not have

Bella Marie,"October 2, 2022","Pilot's Kakuno Fountain pens are my GO TO favorite fountain pens. The nibs are
high quality and compatible with the Pilot Metropolitan's nibs (so if you have
one of those you could potentially try a different nib size/type with this
body). They're so affordable too and come in adorable colors but you can't go
wrong with a demo pen! It feels nice to hold and doesn't roll off the table.
Pilot really knocked it out the park with this pen and I'm so glad it has so
many nib sizes and body color options now!"

yuce,"May 28, 2022","I prefer the shape and size of the Kakuno over my Pilot Prera. The nib writes
thin without feeling scratchy or skipping, Choosing between Pilot's Fine vs
Extra Fine is just a matter of personal preference- I write on the smaller side
(within one line on 5-7mm graph paper) and Fine is my personal favorite. Works
well with the CON-40 and I love the clear look and the face on the nib!"
jessiwiswell,"May 3, 2022",Fun to use
dpalbsp,"April 21, 2022","I bought this pen on Amazon quite a while before I even thought to look it up
here, but I wish that I hadn’t bought it at all. I’ll start with the
positives before I get to the negatives. The good: The pen is adorable, and the extra-fine nib is very, very fine, which
is nice if your handwriting is super small or if you’re writing something
super dense (like in a language such as Japanese or even very compact math
equations). I also like the transparency of the entire pen (I have this odd
fondness of clear objects, so the pen immediately gets a 5/5 in terms of
aesthetics). The triangular grip is nice, as well. The bad: The nib was kind of scratchy at first, but that’s to be expected with
a brand-new pen, and it will smoothen out as you write with it more. It’s also
not ideal for cleaning, which I’ll get to below.The deal-breaker: If you are going to use a fountain pen and clean it out
regularly, do not buy this pen. It simply doesn’t dry properly, regardless of
dry time or method. I thought that this was just my fault, but looking at images
of other people’s Kakunos showed me that theirs didn’t dry completely,
either. By this, I mean that there’s this small ring of water that remains at
the top of the pen, right where the nib sits in the pen. I’ve tried a
hair-dryer (on the coolest setting, by the way, don’t melt your pen!), I’ve
left it sitting in microfiber for over a week, I’ve even tried threading a
tissue into it, but that ring of water still wouldn’t go away. I could only
find the root cause when I pulled out the nib and feed. The problem is that the
hole where the nib and feed fit through that tube which connects to your
cartridge/converter is too similar in diameter to the outer portion that you
hold, so the water gets trapped inside. tl,dr: It’s an adorable beginner pen, but you shouldn’t get it if you’re
going to write with it regularly, because it won’t dry out.  "

kdavoli,"January 24, 2022","I use it with a converter and find that it doesn't hold very much ink, but
that's fine since it doesn't use much as it writes.  This is the finest tip I've
been able to affordably find, and it's my go-to pen for writing in 3mm square
notebooks like the Hobonichi note or the idea book in the Kokuyo jibun techo."
G Tec C Fan,"October 14, 2021","Better looking extra-fine nib option, in comparison to the Penmanship, but not
quite as comfortable for long writing sessions. The snap cap is great for short
notes, as I have a tendency to over-tighten screw lids. The Penmanship cap is
already showing signs of wear on the threads because of that. When I realized
just how few Pilot pens actually have extra-fine as a nib option I knew I had to
get the Kakuno in extra-fine and leave getting a fine nib for a Metropolitan or
Prera. Will probably buy again if anything happens to this one."

J Elgarico,"February 28, 2021","Great value for the price. This is my first Japanese extra fine nib. I don't
find it writes that much finer than a fine nib and it comes at a cost of being
scratchier. "
Alexandre,"June 7, 2020","Outstandingly fine line, similar to the Pilot Penmanship, but in a more
practical form factor.  I bought this pen originally for practicing Kanji, and
the EF nib is more than up to the task of writing complex characters legibly. 
It even manages to do so without feeling scratchy at all!  This pen is very
comfortable to hold—the section is relatively wide and shaped like a rounded
triangle, but in a way that is much less ""enforcing"" of your grip than the Lamy
Safari section.  It takes the CON-70 converter (sold separately) which—with
its effortless filling mechanism and large ink capacity—gives this pen a
massive leg-up on other cartridge-converter filled 'beginner pens.'  This pen
would be great for anyone who loves EF nibs, or even for someone trying an
EF/UEF nib for the first time.  It's also great for penmanship practice in
general.  Give it a try!"
cheznak,"January 21, 2020","I have often purchased most of my pens both fountain and ballpoint types from

throwawayforkhey,"March 8, 2019","I use this Pilot Kakuno to bullet journal in a Rhodia Goalbook. I always use
Pilot black ink cartridges (as a fountain pen novice, I'm still too intimidated
by the many, many refillable ink options). I would definitely recommend this
notebook/pen/ink combo! I haven't had any issues with longer-than-anticipated
dry times or smudging. I tend to close the notebook quickly after writing, and I
haven't found that the ink transfers over to the opposite page. I only have one
issue with this pen-- I have to replace the cap every time I set it down. If I
leave the cap off, even for a relatively short amount of time, the ink dries out
and it takes several seconds of blank scribbling to get it flowing again. I
haven't noticed this problem when I use the same Pilot ink cartridges in a fine
nib Pilot Metropolitan pen, so I imagine it has something to do with the
Kakuno's extra fine nib. Despite this small issue, I'd still recommend the
Kakuno to any other fountain pen newbies like myself. "
olivia00giner,"November 11, 2018","this is my first fountain pen, and I’m in love! the extra fine nib is similar

alicew2016,"May 20, 2021","After being burned by various low-quality knockoff fountain pens, I was worried
that the Kakuno with extra-fine nib would skip ink and scratch the paper to the
point where it’s unusable. However, all of my worries were laid to rest when I
tried it! This pen writes smoothly and reliably without any skipping,
scratching, or leaking. I bring it with me everywhere I go, and it writes on
Leuctturm 80gsm paper without bleeding - perfect for bullet journaling. I am
currently halfway done with the ink cartridge that was provided, and will be
trying this pen with a Pilot Iroshizuku ink next. I highly recommend this
fountain pen for beginners!"
Dalmindor,"May 12, 2021","I do like this pen! The price is nice, and it writes just as well as the Pilot
Metropolitan (or as close as I can figure, given that the Metropolitan isn't
offered in extra fine). If you have a wetter ink, it does flow down into the cap a bit; which gets kind
of noticeable with the clear design. The clear design also means that the CON-B
converter isn't the most visually appealing option. And, personally, I'm not a
fan of the grip--'incorrect' as I know it is, I do prefer some flexibility in
the way I grip my pens, and the tripod shape doesn't allow for that as
comfortably. Still--the most important thing is that it writes, and writes well. And the
little ':P' face on the nib is a cute touch."
Mandasmac,"March 9, 2021","OK: I just bought this pen because it was the least expensive one that fit the
“con-70” ink converter. I immediately switched the nib out for a stub nib

fosterjenkins,"January 23, 2021","I recently have been having issues with pain in my wrist. Though I don't perform
a ton of writing in work or everyday settings, to help alleviate my issue, one
of the changes I made was to get a fountain pen to replace the cheap ballpoints
in my life. This wasn't the first fountain pen I've had in my life. A cheap pen
from Staples had that honor, though I forget the brand and wouldn't give it
glowing reviews. In my ignorance, I turned to Jetpen's recommendations for beginners, and that
was one of the best decisions I could have made. A thorough, well-written piece,
it brought me to this particular pen, among others.I cannot say how well the ink in this kit performs, as I immediately installed
the converter and filled it with a J. Herbin ink, but I can say that I love this
pen. It's the smoothest pen I've ever used. It's comfortable and very easy to
use and seems robustly built for a ""cheap"" (relatively speaking) pen. I'm not a
fan of how thin the lines are, but that's my personal preference and exactly why
I bought several different pens to test. If you're a beginner looking at your
first fountain pen, look no further. It's cheap enough you can get several to
decide what you're looking for, but good enough to use for a lifetime."

LadyGrey,"January 7, 2021","this EF nib gives me the thinnest line when writing, and I love it for that
reason! I like the clear body/barrel to see how much ink I've got left, and for
as fine as the line is when writing with this pen, the ink flows without any
issues. Like the F version of this pen, it does take a little time to get the
ink moving after it's been cleaned/flushed, but I typically store the pen upside
down after re-inking to let gravity do its thing. Great starter pen for someone
curious about using fountain pens. "

set up the pen plus the pilot CON-40 converter together easily! "
txbkwyrm,"December 7, 2020","I prefer extra fine nibs.  This pen was perfect.  Add in the fun of a
see-through body, and you have my favorite new toy."
rokovitz,"November 28, 2020","Great gateway fountain pen for me.  I might like the Fine better than the extra
fine next time.  I am also trying to figure out how I got it to bleed.  I did
something wrong when i put the ink in."
linda.enren,"October 16, 2020","Love how thin the line is, when I’m using it to fill spaces I can get a nice
texture going"
OrangePatty1,"October 13, 2020","I really like this extra-fine point, so this is my second one. It's easy to push
off the cap with my thumb and first finger, to write quickly.  And the price is
nice!!"
nilufarkamdar7,"October 9, 2020",Love it and recommend it. 
yangsoomary,"September 29, 2020",Fine tip fountain pen! I can write small letters with it. Love it so much:)
Aiwyn,"September 27, 2020","This is by far the thinnest extra fine I have ever used! Perfect for small
handwriting and minimal bleeding even on regular college ruled loose leaf paper
which I use for school. All of my kakunos are comfortable to hold and
lightweight for long writing sessions. Highly reccomend! "
mstahl,"September 21, 2020","best cheap fountain pen - since I discovered these I sold all my antique fancy
ones and use these alone. the extra fine is really EXTRA FINE - superb!"
patabel,"September 5, 2020",Love it.  Just got back to writing with a fountain pen.  Writes quite nice.
ericas,"August 3, 2020","This is my first fountain pen and I can't believe it was so inexpensive, it
writes beautifully with such a lovely fine line. I am looking forward to
refilling the cartridge with a syringe as another reviewer mentioned, and am
thrilled to have found a very low-waste solution to handle my love of pens
(refillable pen + ink in glass bottles for the win!)"
bluebear2341,"July 29, 2020",It is adorable and writes very well
kkchambers,"June 28, 2020",Very smooth for an extra fine nib.
Generally,"May 25, 2020","I bought the Kakuno and Pilot Metropolitan at the same time and find myself
using the Metropolitan more often for prolonged writing. I find the width of the
kakuno too small and the weight too light to be comfortable for my hands. For
reference I am a male who uses size S for most gloves.Things I like about the kakuno: ability to fit the CON-70 which has a nice ink
capacity and it's fun design.I like the clear body and being able to see how much ink I have, but I find my
ink spilling into the cap and into the ridges where the pen screws together, and
when writing, I sometimes notice ink spilling out onto my paper because I see
random dots. I'm not sure if it's how i've installed the converter or how I
transport my pens, but seeing my ink spill over into different parts of the pen
makes it look messy, which can bother those who like to have their items look
clean."
Nicci,"May 15, 2020","This is an excellent fountain pen, particularly given the price point. A great
starter pen for drawing or writing. FWIW, the Pilot pink ink is a wonderful
companion to this pen."
gschlegel7,"April 29, 2020","I have been searching for an extra fine nib that was finer than most and I found
it in this pen.  I often use a Lamy Safari to draw with but needed a finer line.
 This is perfect and isn't scratchy but writes quite smooth.  The pen is light
weight and has enough flat sides to keep it from rolling out of my fingers. Very
Comfortable! Nice size diameter and length for adult hands.  Yes it's
inexpensive.  It's light weight plastic tells you it's inexpensive but the
design and performance will tell you it's an excellent value!"
El Bandito,"April 23, 2020","Good pilot quality of nib and writing. Body is light and ergonomic. Feels like a
kaweco sport( also a great pen). I’d love to see pilot make these kakuno sin a
brass body. The kaweco sport pen clip nicely fits on the kakuno’ scalp also. A
value at a great price!"
montegab,"March 21, 2020","It's wonderful. For someone who has small handwriting or otherwise likes fine
lines, this is perfect. It's comfortable in the hand, looks good, and has an
excellent nib. The value is through the roof for the price."
jbai430bc,"April 5, 2019",bad buy the pilot metropolian instead; this is extra scratchy
Becca,"February 15, 2019",I love these! Good for everyday writing!
stephanie.parathyras,"October 30, 2018","I love this for grading! I'm buying another just in case I lose this one. Things
happen to me"
NontradStudent,"October 15, 2018","I got this pen to test inks. It is now what I use for my journalling.The extra fine nib is just that. It lays down a thin line of ink, and legibility
does not suffer even at small sizes. It is a little toothy in use, but that is
to be expected. And if one needs an extra fine nib one may either use this pen
as-is or remove the nib and feed and install them in another Pilot pen."
anthonyjin.cal,"September 10, 2018","for nib so fine, it is very smooth and wet. I have also found that needlepoint
nibs of the like may have characteristics such as a unwanted thicker horizontal
strokes. With pilots steel nibs, i hardly find any of these issues since their
nibs are very rounded, hence equal width on both vertical and horizontal
strokes. You will find that to not be the exception here as well."
Fat456cat,"July 19, 2018","Pilot Kaküno is a very good fountain pen. Light weight, durable, writes
smoothly.  Pens and ink shipped just hours after ordering and received in two
days."
lawerner,"February 5, 2018","Pilot's extra fine nib lays down a crisp, thin line without tearing the paper.
It's my first time writing with one of their EF nibs and I was not disappointed.
The clear demonstrator body is very attractive. I could see many users using a
little bit of grease to just fill the body with ink rather than put a cartridge
in. The clear line is a nice addition to the Kakuno family, which is
surprisingly one of my favourite pilot fountain pen lines out of the lot."
juanmoru,"January 4, 2019","best budget pen Ive ever owned, much better than all my kawecos and twsbi, I
used resin to moded it to eyedroper and now this is my favorite pen in my
arsenal, love the extra fine so much for small details, you can check my work in
instagram, I mainly illustrate with fountain pen and watercolor@juanmoru"
throwawayforstudies,"February 14, 2018","Really enjoying this as a cheaper learner pen. Buy a converter or more
cartridges now because the one that it comes with will be used up quickly.. I
like that it's clear and the shape of the body is really nice. Just don't shake
it vigorously or you will get ink out of the seam between the nib and the body. 
Feels smooth when writing, no problems with ink flow. I've never had it leak
while in my bag."
davidmartyndean,"April 23, 2018","This was disappointing for a pen bearing the ""Pilot"" label.  I took one star off
because it lacks a pocket clip--which means a person using this pen is going to
have to have a case to carry it around in instead of just putting it in his/her
pocket.I took a second star off because the instructions are only in Japanese. 
Apparently the manufacturer has not realized these pens are sold in many other
countries.  Finally a third star was taken off because the capillary action is poor.  The
ink took over 30 minutes to work down to the nib.Seriously, if one is considering a beginner fountain pen--this is not the best
choice.  The Platinum Preppy is a better choice in terms of performance and
value."
Juno,"November 5, 2021","There are only 2 websites you can purchase this JDI (Japanese Direct Import)
mechanical pencil in US. A mutifunction pencil and pen all in one is very
convenient if you don't feel like carrying both pens and pencils. It is made of
beautiful full metallic brass body which has r◉tring logo engraved by the
clip, and it feels very sturdy and heavy when you hold it. I personally prefer
Uni Jetstream refills over original r◉tring refills, because they are bit
scratchy and not smooth as Jetstream. Uni Jetstream SXR-200-05 refills are
compatible with Rotring 600 3 in 1."
frias_edgar,"December 14, 2020","Just as I expected them to be, fits perfectly and comfortably.  I ordered both
silver and black."
henningsnell,"April 18, 2022","I wanted to minimize the number of writing instruments I needed for work. I
bought this, replaced the ballpoints with Uni Jetstreams and the lead with Uni
Kuru Toga. I filed the button down by about 1/4"" (it doesn't actually do
anything) and added a Pentel eraser (You don't want to go too far or the eraser
will interfere with clicking to advance lead). The knurling keeps the eraser
firmly and perfectly in place. I also added a black soft, foam grip (only a
small challenge due to the knurling on the existing grip but, again, this also
keeps it firmly in place) and now it is the perfect writing instrument.
Excellent quality machining and finish, nice weight, smooth action. Especially
after my small modifications, I can't imagine a better option."
zshawhan,"November 9, 2021","I had a Rotring 600 multipen years ago, and really liked it.  It worked well and
wasvery durable; in fact almost indestructable.  I gave it as a gift to a very good
friend, whoat the time was a teacher and could really appreciate the multiple pens and a
pencil thatthe multipen had.  Finding this new version by accident reminded me of just how
muchI really liked that pen.  They've changed the design slightly, but it's still
basically the samepen; using it is like visiting with an old friend."
mrufer,"April 26, 2021","Substantial pen, great mechanics for cartridge /color selection. Feels real
solid.Minimal rattling for a multi-cartridge pen. Worth the money. Recommend without
reservation."
Rick Davis,"February 25, 2022","This is a new take on the rOtring trio which I have been using for twenty years.
The quality is typical rOtring and the twins mechanism to select the cartridge
is elegant and simple.Great pen."
lpascua96786,"August 30, 2021","Very quick service. The model is a revision from the one I first acquired in
1996. Same refills and everything, which makes life easier. "
mellwoodglass,"April 21, 2021","This pen is awesome.  I loaded it with some red and turquoise Monteverde refills
and some colored leads.  It's absurd.  I love it."

later thank you"
kookylaski,"July 20, 2015","I like the colors and enjoy how vibrant they are. The one little problem I'm
having is that when I go to use them, i really have to shake them for a long
while in order for them to actually get the dark ink instead of that clear
color. "
leebcgfx,"August 6, 2019","Very good markers. The colors are good, and I like them for doing the small
detail work after larger areas are done.One thing to be aware of, they should be kept laying down, and not standing up.
I had a lot of trouble with the White not covering and looking spotty till I
started doing that."
jennifermehlman,"July 28, 2017","These pens are awesome.  The ink is opaque.  The flow is smooth and easy; no
clogging or blots.  The drying time is a bit longer than some other acrylic
pens, but not by much.  The nibs are hard and there is no felting of the tip. 
You cannot get a better water-based acrylic pen for the money."

buttercupgirl911,"May 7, 2020","LOVE these pens. Ordering was easy and they came timely. I use the larger tipped
ones and the fine point for rock painting and occasionally on canvas. They are
blend-able which is fun."
kriegeirk,"March 14, 2020","Store these horizontally or you will be sad. I’ve owned these for years, and these still work great. A few have become less
opaque, but with some more pumping and testing on scratch paper the pigments
build back up again. Unfortunately, you lose a lot of ink during the process—
pumping the nib gets you globs dripping out, and even then it’ll still
sometimes have opacity problems.The ones that have the hardest time staying opaque for me are the Yellow and
White. The ones that are consistently the most opaque for me are the Pink, Light
Blue, and Light Green.Wonderful for art, and truly buildable on top of one another (as long as you let
the first layer dry completely first)."
nettijean,"February 27, 2020",Just right!

Disco Gina,"October 10, 2019","Coveted. My first set of poscas. I can't stop touching them. The flow is very
posca-y! Smooth, consistent, opaque enough. I am a tiny baby bit surprised that
the white is not as opaque as the medium point version, but adding layers helps
increase opacity with these fine points. "
leem1106,"September 2, 2019","Highly pigmented and it’s a nice fine point. I have used it on black paper and
it is very opaque. No bleed through and dries quickly. "
julienurnberger,"August 5, 2019","Love the colors and the fine tip...but the markers seemed to fray or rip the
paper If I did more than one mark through. Also slight splatter if you apply
pressure. Overall positive though "

sherryportillo,"November 3, 2018","Very pleased with the pens.  Began immediately using them for rock painting.  I
have a ministry called, ""God's Word on Rocks"" and I paint rocks with scriptures
on them and hide them (in plain sight) for that special someone to find.  I
couldn't do it without these pens as when I tried to use regular acrylic paint,
I wasn't as successful... causing me to not want to paint as much.  These pens
were the answer!  Plus, they were delivered within days of my order.  Thank you!"

carolina,"November 12, 2014",There are great! But i wanted the other fater markers. 
eabarth,"September 14, 2015","These are the best pens I've ever used. They write really smoothly and visibly,
and the ink disappears completely upon erasure (you'll only see your indents on
the page if you press down hard as you write).Some amazing things about this pen:- There is no eraser dust, so your lap won't be covered with pink specks at the
end of the day.- Erasing is really quick and easy compared to Paper Mate Erasermates.- The ink just vanishes when erased, on all kinds of paper, and even through
tape!- The ink can be layered through multiple passes so that it can even been seen
on top of dark images! Reduces the need for silver markers/pens.Some minor drawbacks:- The ink runs out pretty quickly compared to Paper Mate Erasermates.- Writing fades over time and is more susceptible to erasure from regular
friction, although I've never seen it become unreadable.Despite the minor drawbacks (if you really want a pen to last, you shouldn't be
using erasable anyway), these have easily become my favorite erasable pens. The
other colors work just as well, and I use them for everyday applications. I
definitely won't ever use another kind of erasable pen again. To the person who dried her notes with a hair drier and had them all disappear
(sorry, but lol), you could've just stuck the pages in the freezer afterward,
and they would've come back—you probably recopied all of your notes
unnecessarily. "
nbk7mbs,"December 2, 2015","I like the 0.5mm tip size, but the color does not come out as black, more like a
dark grey. I wonder it is because of the type of ink needed for the eraser."
cellostar,"August 23, 2020","This pen works really well! It is pretty smooth and erases and well. My only
complaint is that the ink is not very pigmented. It is more of a translucent
dark grey than black. But other than that this pen is awesome!"
maribeth.seveses,"September 11, 2012","Nice design. Comfortable. Writes well. Not your typical ink. Ink is kind of
watercolor like and light but it writes VERY well. "
shazztastic,"December 31, 2010","The ink is the same as any other Pilot FriXion pen - so it's already considered
great for erasable inks. This pen differs in the external presentation - and I
have to say it's incredible.  The body is thick for a perfect firm grasp with a grip which has just enough
traction, the eraser is located at the tip for easy access and the clip just
gives you another excuse to carry it around with you everywhere. And there's
just that sense of style.  A definite recommend!"
heidiheidi160,"February 24, 2022",Reliable erasable pen
Kriss,"February 4, 2019","I love these to write in planners. Fine tip but still pretty good ink flow. 
Black FriXion ink is notorious for being grey and not very saturated.  If you
want darker ink, I recommend the Navy (Blue Black) and the Purple (Violet). "
dlmore1208,"January 24, 2016","Decided, after some use, that I like these pretty well. They come in very handy
for the paperwork that I do that requires frequent corrections..... wish the ink
were darker.... worst aspect: the first pen ran out VERY quickly, lasting what,
perhaps a month of regular use.  "
loversflyingfree,"May 29, 2012","This pen ink is completely erasable.  (Well, there is a very very faint trace of
what you've erased, but that's only if you know what was there and are looking
for it intently.) I do agree that the ink is not a true black compared to other gel ink pens, but
it's black compared to other ballpoint pens, in my opinion. My only problem is that I don't know where to use this pen except for fun.I've heard of people's notes disappearing after leaving their notebook in a hot
car for hours, or writing disappearing from when the papers rub against each
other for extended amounts of time.  Therefore, I wouldn't want to use it for
taking notes (don't want all my hard work going down the drain) or on anything I
turn into my professors (how troublesome it'd be if they threw away a seemingly
blank piece of paper and then give you a 0 for your ""missing"" assignment/test). Unless you live in a climate that's perpetually cold and have nothing to worry
fear regarding the ""accidental erasing,"" this is a good novelty item, but that's
about it."
ustn2007,"November 17, 2010","Wow, I liked the original FriXion, but this one is great. Easy to carry in the
pocket and click with one hand to write, and the eraser is right there without
having to remove cap. The ink is not as dark as I would like, but dark enough to
work good. Erases completely and the refill is the same as for the original
FriXion with removable cap. Next we need a ""high class"" version of the
retractable FriXion. As usual, great service from JetPens - Thank you so much!"
jaze,"January 2, 2023","In comparison to the poor performance of the frixion fineliners, I really,
really enjoy the gel pens. I started using them in high school and bought this
one in particular last fall for my statistics class because I hate pencil but I
needed something erasable. The ink is slightly paler in the smaller milimeter,
but besides that I have no issues with skipping or any other major performance
issues. My only issue is mainly aesthetic-- I don't love the look of these pens.
They're really bulky and can be quite annoying to hold for long periods, at
least for me. "
tristan.sculley,"November 30, 2022","The pen I received was not nearly as smooth as the one my friend owns, which is
what I was getting it for in the first place. The mechanism to retract it also
broke. I’m sure this was just a one-off thing, so I’m keeping the review at
3 stars rather than 1, but I’m making others aware of this issue.  "

margherital,"May 16, 2022","This pen is great for annotating in books and the ink is a lot darker than the

Lupita Angel Zamora,"October 9, 2019","I don't usually like using pencils for math since over time the pencil would
smear on the rest of the work making it all gray and hideous with my terrible
handwriting it was not a good mix. So I decided on getting an erasable pen and
it works like a charm it works perfectly well my notes are looking much more
legible, and I know they will stay like that because it's in pen. It is very
easy to erase and leaves no dust. The fine tip is quite great and helps my
handwriting improve. The color is not very pigmented its a gray color, but I
think it's very close to a pencil color so I love it it's not hard to read or
anything it's just not like a black pen, other colors like blue or purple are
more pigmented if you are interested in that. The only thing I don't like is
that when I'm graphing since I go quickly it is barely noticeable of alike and I
have to go over it, also It smears the points if you are not careful, the
smearing is not noticeable with any other activity."
daisylee,"September 23, 2019","Frixion's the best! My favourite gel pen for any kind of sketching; the ink is

Vivi07,"August 16, 2019",Great only thing is that the ink is GREY not black but everything else is good 
greensweatshirtgirl,"May 23, 2019","by far my favorite pen. it hardly smudges, is dark enough to easily see, and
erases incredibly well (would recommend buying a block eraser if you use it a
lot though). plus there's a ton of tip/barrel size/style options"
nicholaspsmart,"May 17, 2019",I like these but it is very similar to one I bought at Walmart for less than $1.
ValAZ,"March 27, 2019","The ink is not black, but dark gray. I’m assuming that’s due to it being
erasable. I liked the color despite it not being black. It writes smoothly &
erases easily. The reason I’m giving this pen 4 stars is because if you write
on both sides of a sheet of paper (leuchtturm) & erase ink on one side, it
erases the ink on the other side of the page. "
bdickens,"March 14, 2019","The pen works fine. I made a mistake in ordering 0.5 mm. I prefer a thicker
line, perhaps 0.8 mm."
beeee,"March 9, 2019","the ink is more of a grey tone instead of a black, but it erases super well. i
might get one of the multipens to see how those work"
samjiahn,"January 15, 2019","The pen is very well erasable. However, the ink is also erasable. If you let the
pen or the note that wrote this this pen in a warm/hot environment too long, you
won't be able to see it again. So don't let your note seat on your car too long
in summer."
Paulina,"July 19, 2018",It's okay but ink isn't that dark black.
natnat,"July 5, 2018","This frixion is a really good pen. The black is a little lighter but still good.

that’s ok for what it does :)Happy with this purchase"
ogoner12,"October 2, 2017","This ink is not black. I didn't expect it to be, you shouldn't either. It's
really a light grey, but still works fine for every application, just a little
lighter. The tip writes smoothly, and I haven't ever had any problems with
skipping or railroading. The ""eraser"" removes lines completely and the entire
system seems to work great. "
mcsmith1214,"September 1, 2017","I have been surprised with this pen! I use it more than I thought I would. The
ink writes a little light but the erasability is outstanding."
morgen,"June 27, 2017","very thin ink, eraser can be harsh on some paper (it's just a lot of friction)

daheejoo31,"April 1, 2016","This pen writes so smoothly and it is great you have the flexibility to make

these pens!"
dlmore1208,"February 17, 2016","I tried the capped version a couple years ago, only available in 0.7 mm point -
didn't like it much. Definitely not dark enough, not even close to the usual
permanent gel pens i use regularly (pentel energel x-needle). Decided to try the
retractable a few months ago because retractable is more convenient for me, and
it came in a 0.5mm.I have started using these pens regularly on forms that will likely need
erasing. You have to learn to write with them smoothly, can't press too hard
(not good for NCR paper). The erasing feature is fabulous.Two complaints: 1) they still AREN'T DARK ENOUGH. They are barely passable, about the darkness
of a standard, regular ink - not the vivid black I get from a gel pen. I tried
the 0.38 because I like fine points -  it is NOT dark enough for me to use.  2) They RUN OUT OF INK EXTREMELY FAST. Annoyingly fast. I use this pen everyday
for total of about two full pages of text, and it lasts me perhaps two weeks,
maybe three. compared to regular gel inks. In light of this the pens are
unreasonably expensive (3x the other pens I use), refills are only slightly
(30%) more expensive than my usual gel refills, but still too expensive. Saw a
comment that the pilot website was cheaper, and much as I love jetpens, I may
check it out."
mrsbogan09,"December 31, 2015",Just ok
shamilahfaria,"November 29, 2015",erases well. ttly rad. 
talia,"October 31, 2015","The ink is more gray than black but it is fully erasable which is great. Very
useful when you constantly have to change dates around in your planner or if you
are someone who makes frequent mistakes when writing."
swt_baby_angel,"September 26, 2015","Pen writes smooth! Love that it's erasable however, I don't like that the ink
comes off greyish and not a true black. Over all a great idea for erasable pens!"
cantrell.kayla27,"August 4, 2015","I like this pen but it caused me a lot of trouble. Don't get me wrong this pen
is excellent, it writes well and it erases better than any other erasable pen
I've tried. The only thing I don't like is the ink is more of a watery gray
instead of a dark black. Now the trouble part:One lovely rainy morning on the way to class everything in my backpack ended up
getting soaked, had to sit through a four hour class, etc. and when I got home
my agenda was still wet so I got out the hair dryer. Unfortunately I saw the ink
disappear as I moved the hair dryer to dry the pages. I should've thought about
it ahead of time, but I didn't know how else to dry a sopping planner. Even
though the ink was gone I could still see traces of where I had written on the
pages, so afterwards I had to go and recopy everything with a different pen.My advice is to not use this pen for important things because you never know
what will happen. I'd rather not waste time trying to recopy what has
disappeared, or risk it happening to an assignment. I really don't know what
else to use this pen for now, so it hasn't been used since that accident. It
really is a cool novelty though, so if you've got a use for an erasable pen by
all means get this one, it really is the best I've found. Just don't apply heat
to the ink."

ireallyshouldbewriting,"July 23, 2014","Easily the best erasable pen I've ever used. I don't like using pencil if I can
help it, even when sketching, so this was a perfect find and well worth the
reasonable price. "
kiwi,"July 13, 2013","I love these pens!!! I liked the idea of eracable ink and got one just for fun, but I was pleasantly
surprised with how smooth it writes and now this is one of my favorite pen. I
find myself using this pen more than any other pen. Ink can be eraced pretty
clean so perfect for my monthly agenda book. I immediately got other colors as
well. My colleagues at work are now very curious about it too!"
Lapicerista,"April 28, 2013","The ink is not black, is gray, and a bit light at that, almost like a #2 pencil,
so it beats the purpose of needing an erasable pen. If it were darker (a lot
more!), it would be great. In other colors the concept works great. Also, for being a 0.5mm, the lines are more like 0.7mm. So, this pen is in my
opinion a Gray 0.7mm Pen. Or a liquid #2 HB.   This particular pen is preferable to the capped one, better and more streamlined
design."
copicarker,"June 28, 2012","I love the design of this pen, but I was sorely disappointed by the color of the
ink. It was a watery greyish color...  Still, it gets points for the erasability and slick design. I hope Pilot finds a
way darken their black ink. The other colors I tested, red and purple, were
fine."
dearestkoishii,"May 8, 2012","Bought this somewhere else only because it was sold out at the time.. I love this pen, its a click pen which I love because I hate caps. Its also
erasable which means no more carrying around whiteout in my already cramped
pencil case. If I didn't buy it after school ended this would be the pen I would
be writing my notes with. I'm a person who has tiny hand writing and prefers .4
or .3 mm, but this pen writes well enough, that I can stil write with it and not
have my letters look like a blob. Hopefully Pilot will come out with a .4m
design? I docked one star because despite it being the perfect pen otherwise the ink is
faded.. In my opinion rather than looking black its more of a dark grey. If the
ink was darker it would definitely be a 5 star pen.  "
LightZeagle,"May 1, 2012","This pen is pretty good. For me, the pen would skip a little in the beginning,
but after a few sessions of using it, the FriXion writes pretty smooth. The
erasable component works fine as well. The only problem I have with this pen is
that the ink isn't black. It's a bit lighter, almost grey looking. Thus, I
wouldn't use this pen for professional use. However, it is a very affordable and
efficient pen if you don't mind the ink color. However, if you do mind, the
Uni-ball Signo is another great pen."
wyzlic,"January 28, 2012","This pen is great, the first erasable pen I've found that works well to write
and to erase. One interesting thing I've found is that it actually gets erased
by heat - the friction eraser just generates local heat; you can also erase it
with a blow dryer."
stella,"February 8, 2011","this pen is great! erased so easily and the style is better than 0.4mm with the
cap one.however, the price in jet pens is much more expensive than other
websites in US or in other countries.hope it will be cheaper later."
toosde,"January 29, 2011","ordered another one for my best friend, she loves it :)"
toosde,"January 24, 2011","My boyfriend loves this. The eraser on the end of the barrel and clip on side is
perfect for him when he's at work. No-fuss erasable pen."
silentvt,"November 11, 2010",great pen! could be darker...
tjr_shop,"July 21, 2019","Doesn't hold up well to Arizona heat.  When the ink gets hot due to a warm car,
either on the person or accidentally, the ink will start to lighten due to the
same reason that the ink vanishes to begin with, heat.  I have learned that I
can put the pen in the freezer for a few hours and that ink will darken but
still not to my liking.Also this pen isn't good if you are wanting to keep records, since it can be
erased.  However, I've been told that if someone erases the ink on the paper you can put
the paper in the freezer and the ink will return.  Now, I haven't tried this yet
but that would make for a cool party trick or prank."

anything else. I love all the colors. "
PaperAddict,"November 16, 2020","I love the weight of this pen. I use it with uni-ball 307, Pentel Energel, and
of course the vintage Sarasa colors. The barrel is not terribly comfy, but I
fixed that by using a pen grip. The Omni grip fits on this one. "
byrdrice,"April 25, 2022","Its a great pen.  I had accidentally ordered the gel inks in a previous purchase
and have enjoyed using them in the plastic bodied pens.  I decided to try the
metal body so I'd have a dedicated pen that I could change out the refills with.
 I'm not disappointed.  It has a nice weight to it.  I love the convenience of
the clip and if it falls into a bag, I can easily locate it to the weight.  I
definitely recommend!.  (Oh and Jet Pens is my favorite online pen shop.  I
can't give them enough stars for their great customer service and the variety of
the products.)"
joliepaige622,"June 7, 2022","I would rate 5/5 stars. They work just as great as normal zebra sarasa vintage
pens but have a nice weighted feel to them due to the material the pen body is
made of. The clicking sound is also more muted than in normal zebra sarasa pens
which is nice if you don’t wanna be as distracting when you click your pen. It
gives a nice sense of adultness and its an altogether smooth writing experience.

Eckert,"June 20, 2021","The pen itself is beautiful and the shade of blue-gray ink even more so. I only

I could pierce paper. Great ink, though. Nice color, almost no smear or bleed.
Very little skipping.Beautiful tool"
David,"May 28, 2022","I bought this pen at a specialty store in Atlanta. (Sorry JetPens!) As soon as I
tried it, I had to have it. The ink color is great. If you want something that
looks professional, it does. If you like Zebra Sarasa Clips but want something
heavier in your hand, you should give this pen a try. (I think my writing is
better when I use a heavier pen.)"
lebelon91,"April 15, 2022","Fantastic! My only wish is that they did the Vintage series in a .7 version, but
that's just because I prefer a bolder line. The only ""problem"" I have with an
otherwise perfect pen! I keep one in each of my suit jackets, and several more
scattered around my place and bags just in case!"
Mickey,"March 9, 2022","Absolutely love it. Bought it after considering many pens and going through many
reviews.The weight of it is really nice in the hand and the barrel diameter is
comfortable to hold -- I tend away from wider barrels as I have smaller hands.
Writing with it is smooth, ink is fast-drying, and the click is very satisfying.
The clip also comes in handy!Bought several extras as gifts and they were very well received across the
board. Classy look, comfortable hold, and smooth flowing ink -- Winning
combination!"
ron.janssen,"February 17, 2022","I have pretty much the same thing to say about all of the Sarasa pens --
beautiful colors with beautiful inks and smooth writing. "
Colorico,"October 16, 2022","I can see why this pen line is recommended! I have clammy hands, and the ink
almost never smears (and when it does it’s very slight). The ink color is also
pretty as well"
jilleduffy,"June 30, 2022","I prefer ballpoint pens but have been trying out different gel pens because I
get so annoyed when a ballpoint clogs or won't write. So far, this Zebra Sarasa
is my favorite of the gel pens I've tried because the ink isn't as wet and
loosely flowing as it is with some others. This pen has a bit of heft to it,
which makes it feel substantial. The click is satisfying and the clip looks and
feels durable, like it won't lose its shine too quickly. A lovely buy, nice
enough to be a small token gift for someone!"

ADR in NY,"January 28, 2020","Got mine directly from TWSBI online (if I had known JetPens was on its way to
offer it, I would have waited), so I'm able to give an opinion. This is an
absolutely beautiful pen, at least for those wanting a high capacity ink filler
and have a fondness for rose gold. I was never a fan of the hard plastic red
logo on the cap. With the Rose Gold Eco, it is a disc with a metallic finish
that, in my opinion, has improved its look. Got mine with a fine nib and filled
it with Diamine Oxford Blue to use as an everyday writer. While searching online
I found information as to its price: metal parts were changed from brass or
steel to stainless steel with stainless steel being much harder to work with and
the PVD color coating is more expensive. With this explanation, I find the pen
worth the extra expense. This pen looks, feels, and writes beautifully. It is an
item I personally recommend."
kaishu,"May 25, 2020","I got this pen as my first foray into the world of fountain pens. The price was
way lower than any I had ever seen and thought it would be a good start. I am so
glad I did because this pen writes and, more importantly for me, draws like a
dream. It's so smooth and effortless to make nice, precise lines. Even as a
beginner I had no issues setting up and using and even cleaning to replace a
different color of ink. I now carry it around with me everywhere. I've had no
issues with leaking or dripping ink and the moment I put the pen to paper it's
ready to write without any priming or marking to get the ink flowing.From a beginner's standpoint still familiarizing myself with the new aspects of
fountain pens, I don't see any reason not to try this wonderful pen. With such
an effortless introduction to fountain pens I am definitely ready to invest more
into the hobby."
Danielle,"February 20, 2020","Love TWSBI fountain pens! I had to get the rose gold version for my collection.
I use my pens for sketching & will sometimes go a month without.  The ink never
seems to dry up in them!"
SeungChloe17,"January 24, 2022","Edit: Pretty sure I saw someone else mention that the Rose Gold TWSBI’s are
slightly different from the silver accented TWSBI’s, but I didn’t realize
how different it would be until I actually experienced it.Note: For simplicity, I will refer to my TWSBI Rose Gold <Fine Nib> as a <RG>,
TWSBI ECO White <Extra Fine Nib> as <EF>, and TWSBI ECO White <Fine Nib> as <F>.And just for reference, the inks I’ve been using are: LAMY Black, Iroshizuku
Take-Sumi, TWSBI Black, and LAMY Crystal Ruby. So I wanted to buy a regular ECO in white as my on-the-go pen because I refuse
to take the <RG> one outside of my house. Since my <RG> is a fine nib, I went
ahead and purchased a <F>. They are not the same. The <F> is much, much thicker
than the <RG>. My sister wanted a <EF> so I bought her one, and I realize that
my <RG> is much closer in nib size to an <EF>, though <EF> is like a hair
width’s thinner? So I did end up buying one more <EF> and low and behold,
it’s a nearly perfect match to the <RG>.If I’m writing on Tomoe River Paper, then the <RG> and <F> have very little
difference from each other in terms of nib size.However, if I’m writing on any other paper (Leuchtturm1917, Muji B5 Notebooks,
32lb Laser Jet Paper), I find that the <EF> feels more like the <RG>All this to say that the <RG> is the Goldilocks in comparison to the <EF> and
<F> so if you’re shopping for a different TWSBI, do note that the Rose
Gold-colored nibs are slightly different from the Silver colored nibs. If I ever
find myself with some money to spare, I’d totally go back and buy another Rose
Gold TWSBI."
bridagibbons17,"March 1, 2021","I absolutely love this pen! The rose gold is so pretty and it writes very
smoothly. This is only the second fountain pen I've ever owned but it's
definitely one of the best things I've ever written with. I used Pilot
Iroshizuku ink and Rhodia paper and they both perform beautifully with the pen.
I also really appreciate that TWSBI includes a wrench tool and vial with their
pens, and JetPen's video explaining how to take apart the pen and fill it was
very helpful. Definitely recommend!!"
kathrynammonstiles,"June 20, 2022","This pen is awesome. I use it with my sketchers black waterproof ink and I love
it! I didn't know I would like the demonstrator pens so much, but I do. I didn't
know I would like the piston filling mechanism, but I do. This pen was great on
my flight. I just kept it nib up during take off and landing and was able to use
it on the plane without any leaks. I am very happy with it!"
kathleensuez,"January 19, 2021","Very smooth, wet with little drag, even though there’s a little “scratch”
as I write.  Fill is easy and fills more thoroughly than most “converters”. 
Good balance.  The only reason I gave this a 4 is that it really doesn’t
function any better than a Pilot Metro, yet cost more than double that.  I did
choose to pay for the limited edition rose gold, which brought the price up even
more..  Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy
any other TWSBI Eco.  "
SeungChloe17,"January 5, 2022","I want to start off by saying the rose gold on this pen is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen! Not too much, not too little, just absolutely beautiful!
This is my first ever TWSBI, and it writes like a dream. Depending on the paper
you use, you'll get some variations but the nib is true to size - somewhere
between 0.5 to 0.6mm, which I love. So far, I've filled my TWSBI with Lamy
Black, Lamy Obsidian, and Iroshizuku Take-Sumi. The flow with all three of these
inks are very nice, no issues at all. Two worries of mine: One is how often I'm using the piston converter since I
feel like it's going to break every time I twist it. So when I fill my inks, I
just remove the nib and feed and use a fountain pen syringe to fill up the
piston chamber. And the other is there have been quite a number of reports that
the twsbi barrel is prone to cracking, whether or not it's been dropped. So
while this is a beautiful pen, I don't think I'm ever letting mine leave the
house. I do think the price could be a bit lower? Totally not JetPens' fault but there
are only four parts on the pen that has any rose gold, and from what I hear,
this limited edition TWSBI isn't all that different from regular TWSBI's with
silver accents. Anyway, these are just my personal opinions. I'd gladly give this five stars,
but I have to knock one off because I think the pen should cost under $45.
Regardless, it's my current favorite pen and I can't wait to try out other
TWSBI's. Happy Writing!"

out a fountain pen that’s just a bit more above the price range of the pens
and was very attracted to the TWSBI brand, since you don’t need a converter
for these, and have great great things.Well, it didn’t disappoint at all! This pen is beautiful to look at and write
with! It immediately felt like an upgrade from my other pens. It’s currently
my favorite fountain pen in my small, little collection, and I would highly

alignment pins. I'm not dazzled by red (more of a terra orange) but not
unpleasant.  I gave a black Safari away (first time, kid?) and missed the pen so
I got the Terra Red.  The medium nib puts down a significant line without being
over bearing, and holds up easily to my heavy hand."

by the 2 or 3rd month of school. So while it's great.. the longevity of the pens
is not so great :C I recommend only buying this pen if you're interested in
having a nice occasional journal entry pen. Not if you're a student constantly
writing or someone who works that entails lots of writing."
talia,"October 6, 2015","I love how thinly this pen writes, but it's difficult to get constant ink flow
no matter how I hold the pen."
kevinmorse1,"September 5, 2016","I tried this pen initially because I read on a review site that it was the
""smoothest"" writing of a variety of pens the reviewer was using. This pen is
definitely not the smoothest, it felt very scratchy on the paper as though I
could tear a hole into it. It also skipped in my writing several times and it
was brand new. Very disappointed with this pen."
swt_baby_angel,"September 26, 2015","I like the colors they have in these pens but I'm not really fond of the hold of
the pen. I'm not sure if it's because the pen is thin or if its because there's
really nothing to grip on to when writing. But I still like the pens. At certain
angles of writing with these pens the ink doesn't come out so I wouldn't say it
was all smooth to write with. Just fun to design with. "
brigidm,"June 16, 2016","This pen skips a lot like every third word a lot. At first I thought I it was
because I was using a lot of pressure when writing with it but I tried a lighter
hand and the problem did not improve. "

Emmy,"January 31, 2020","I LOVE ultra fine pens, and this was great the first 2 times I wrote with it.
However, it has gotten super scratchy and skips a lot now. Its almost impossible
to get a smooth line of ink with this pen. I wanted to love it, but I'll stick
with my Uni Jetstream and Pilot g-tec-c4."
Cait,"November 14, 2019","The wide body is something I had to get used to but it's not a problem. Overall,
I find myself having to clean the pen more so that I can actually write with it,

good archival ink quality the pen was not good"
ladb,"September 8, 2018","I wish I had read all of the reviews for this pen before purchasing it. It skips
a lot, but writing slow helps minimize that, so I wouldn't recommend for anyone
who writes fast like me. If you enjoy how thin the lines are, there are better
options for a 0.4 mm or 0.38 mm pen. On a plus side, it is quite comfortable for
not having a comfort grip!"
jsbstn,"July 23, 2018","So, I love the darkness of the ink and the fact that it dries almost instantly;

heathwang7,"March 2, 2017","I bought this pen after purchasing a green Sakura Ballsign Knock Gel and I was
so impressed that I knew I had to get it in black. But for some reason this one
skips quite a bit more than my green one does. I guess for different color inks
the flows are different? I had the same problem with Pilot Juice Ups. Too bad
because I can see that both these pens have a lot to offer."

chelicocat,"May 30, 2022","This pen is gorgeous!! When I look at this pen, I automatically think of spring.
Compared to the Dragon Palace, which has a glossy jade green body with gold
flecks, this pen has a matte pale green body that is almost blue, gold trim, and
a gorgeous purple finial (the top of the cap) with gold sparkles. I love love love how it writes - Sailors very rarely need tuning out of the box
compared to other fountain pen brands - and it's so smooth. The 21K gold nib has
a slightly thicker line than the Dragon Palace's 14K gold nib. For those who
don't know, MF (medium fine) nibs have line widths comparable to 0.5 pens, if
slightly thinner, and sits perfectly in-between F(ine) and M(edium) nibs. 21K
gold nibs also tend to have thicker lines than 14K gold nibs due to their higher
gold content which makes them slightly softer.This Sailor fountain pen does come with a converter like many of their limited
editions do, so you don't need to buy one separately. I have no issues using the
converter (though the capacity is quite small), and the nib flows great straight
out of the box with no skipping whatsoever.Do you need to spend $300+ for a fountain pen? No, there are other brands that
are cheaper. But for how pretty and gorgeous the Sailor fountain pens are and
how great their nib quality control is, I think it's very much worth it. "

cyn4msocal,"December 8, 2020","Love this pen. I absolutely fell I love with the look of this pen. It looks
really and feels expensive. I love the matte black of the barrel. The gold on
the clip and clicker is a nice gold, not too yellow and cheap looking. The
clicker feels sturdy when you press on it. The body has a nice weight to it,
when you are writing it doesn’t feel like it’s going to slip of your hand.
The refill is a basic Sarasa refill. They write very smooth and bold. I did
switch out the size for a .3 which is what I prefer. "
joliepaige622,"June 7, 2022","I would rate 5/5 stars. They work just as great as normal zebra sarasa vintage
pens but have a nice weighted feel to them due to the material the pen body is
made of. The clicking sound is also more muted than in normal zebra sarasa pens
which is nice if you don’t wanna be as distracting when you click your pen. It
gives a nice sense of adultness and its an altogether smooth writing experience.

Mickey,"March 9, 2022","Absolutely love it. Bought it after considering many pens and going through many
reviews.The weight of it is really nice in the hand and the barrel diameter is
comfortable to hold -- I tend away from wider barrels as I have smaller hands.
Writing with it is smooth, ink is fast-drying, and the click is very satisfying.
The clip also comes in handy!Bought several extras as gifts and they were very well received across the
board. Classy look, comfortable hold, and smooth flowing ink -- Winning

corrillustration,"October 25, 2022","Absolutely beautiful pen, and I love the matching Sailor Manyo ink that comes
with it. Sailor MF nibs are one of my favorite sizes, it's close to an F nib for
other brands and rights beautifully right out of the box."
carolyne,"May 2, 2011","I picked this up for lettering work, but, except for larger lettering, I think
I'll prefer this for drawing. I usually like a more fine and precise line and a
drier pen, but pair this pen with a smooth paper (like Rhodia) and it's great
fun for fast doodles. The variation in line width from moderately fine to rather
thick gives a lot of dynamism with a light tough. After minimal drying time, it
handles erasing of underlying pencil lines well (if you don't go overboard
scrubbing at it with the eraser). I don't necessarily find this ink to be
blacker than any other similar pen. I haven't used it long enough to know how
it'll hold up in the long run, so I can't give it a 5 out of 5. But for a loose,
free style of drawing, I recommend this one a lot."
dustooned,"February 15, 2012","I'm still astounded on how cheap this pen is for the amazing quality line weight
and control it has. It's pressure resistance is insane, especially since I'm a
hard presser, and is absolutely variant in its line weight depending on the
user's desire. HIGHLY recommended."
kat,"January 12, 2011","UPDATE: I just wanted to update my review. I still love these pens and use them
constantly, but I did have to warn you that sometimes the ink will bead at the
tip of the brush and will produce blobs and impercise lines. This tends to
correspond with the weather and air pressure. It doesn't happen all the time. I still love them and continue to keep them in my bag for everyday use."
Goncalo Alho,"October 10, 2014","Best pen i ever had. It's not as dry as Kuretake and it better than the super
fine Zebra because it has a softer brush that allows you to draw really thin
lines or thicker ones. A must have for me"
flowbish,"October 26, 2014","This pen is my go-to for inking. I love how thin of a line it can produce,
allowing for a great variation in line weight. The lines also come out extremely
clean, especially on the right paper. Compared to other brush pens I've used,
the tip holds up very well throughout its life. The only complaint I have is
that its ink capacity seems only okay at best. I go through so many of these,
and always get them as gifts for my artist friends."
hummingbird,"September 24, 2016","I'm surprised at how happy I am with this pen. The brush tip is perfectly
responsive. It's great for drawing and handwriting. The ink is very black and
completely water-resistant and eraser-resistant. Nice variety of line widths for
linework and calligraphy, yet the brush tip feels firm. The Tombow Fudenoske is a nice brush pen too, but it seems to have a stiffer tip
and less variable line width, and is slightly less dark black (but great water &
eraser resistance too). I like them both, but I prefer this Zebra brush pen for
more flowy & expresive drawing and writing. Both are worth the value."
mariainc,"July 19, 2018","The tip size is perfect for note headers and other small writing jobs. However,

brett613,"September 4, 2018","I wish I could give this pen 5 stars but the ink is a weakness. The point alone
earns 5 stars, the ink by itself only 1 star.I've illustrated comics for the past 39 years and have used countless numbers
inking tools to create my art. When a friend offered me one of these pens to try
I was quickly impressed how well I could achieve the thick-thin stroke quality
of a sable brush and further amazed at how the tip point held up over repeated
uses. Sadly, the ink is a problem and I don't know why. It goes down smooth and
opaque, but it too easily smudges. India ink applied with a sable brush, or a
quill even, will absorb and dry quickly and then you don't need to worry about
it. With these pens I find the ink appears to be fully dry but even after a long
period of time will lift onto you hand and smudge. When I use these pens I have
to be extra careful and still my art is ""dirty"" with varying degrees of smudges
by the time I am done.My fingers are crossed that they will improve the ink in the future. "

use. Just don't press too hard and don't fill in big spaces with it. That can
make the ink run out faster. I suggest getting either two of them, one for
lining and one for filling in or use ink and a brush to fill in big spaces.
Definitely recommend this pen if you are a beginner with brush pens. Also, I

haroharoharo,"July 15, 2017","First, I noticed that this pen started running out of ink fairly quickly. I
didn't use it much and bought it in order to learn how to do brush pen

could go, which isn't bad. I probably asked for it, buying a fine tip brush pen,
though. "
angle13_13,"June 30, 2017","This is my favorite pen for doing quick calligraphy. The ink is quite a bit
heavier than its Sailor equivalent, and shows feathering on regular computer
paper. Though the ink shows no bleed through, I would not recommend this brush
pen for everyday writing, as the tip seems to wear out quickly. The fine-tipped
Sailor brand equivalent has a much springier tip, and though I prefer this pen
for calligraphy, I use the Sailor for dynanic illustrations. The Sailor pen's
tip allows for a wide variation in line thickness, while this pen has a chisel
shape that creates uniform strokes. "

too."

friendly artist,"August 2, 2016","I bought a handful of brush pens to test out because I wanted to do detail work
that wasn't suited for my Pentel Pocket, and this was my absolute favorite of
the bunch. The ink is very dark, the tip delivers beautifully smooth lines, and
you can get a lot of variation from this one pen. If you're deciding between
this and the Superfine, I'd say go for this one– the Superfine is harder and
gets less variation, and the only thing it's better at than the Fine is getting
consistent hairlines (and that's what fineliners are for!)"

these are great pens for calligraphy and illustration."
good luck,"July 28, 2014","perfect for bold lines!i bought this because someone I know uses them and they looked pretty nifty. And
at 2.50 each I was willing to try them out. They came in, and they're perfect.  I've used it for 2 months now and not a single hair of it has frayed off, like
my Sakura Lining set. The lines are staggered and vary from thin to thick,
swooping and just downright gorgeous.  The ink is perfectly black, it tones well with my black Prismacolor and
everytime i start a line, I get a beautiful, dark ink. If you are a fan of
bigger lines, this is the pen for you. The fine isn't really as small as I had hoped (it's probably the equivalent of a
.8mm - 1mm) , but compared to the medium it's small. The only time I had it
fray, it was one single string that could be easily removed with tweezers, and
the pen was as good as new.  I've left it uncapped for hours, ran it under water by accident, drawn lines
through puddles of wet paper, swirled and stabbed it into my sketchbook and this
is the MVP of art supplies. Super super recommend to anybody who needs a liner!  I'ts still the same beautiful dark black it was when I opened and tested it.
This is my love and my life right now.  I'm probably going to start buying these in bulk and handing them out to my
friends as gifts. Whenever they come over, they use it. It sometimes goes a
little dry when you draw a really long, extended line, but that's probably
because I usually forget to cap it...TLDR: buy this. 15/10 definitely recommend."
richardpace,"March 19, 2014","I bought two Zebras along with two each of Sailor and Kuretake brush pens.  In
order, I preferred the Sailors most of all with the Kuretakes least. These Zebras, fine and super-fine, have a nice stroke compared to the Kuretake's
scratchy line, but has a similar grey/thin ink. If jetpens are out of Sailor pens, I would get these Zebras as alternatives. These are used for drawing, not writing."

ordering more, in fact! The tip is nice and flexible but easy to control, though I'm worried it'll give
out quickly, especially if you push too hard. Either way, it's great for the
price, the ink doesn't seem to smudge or bleed through and it gives some really
great outlines when inking pictures. Even the fine tip makes filling in larger
areas nice and fast while still being precise."

waystation56,"December 28, 2019","After hearing some of my favorite fountain pen fanatics rave about the Decimo, I
decided I needed to try out this vanguard of the vanishing point. When I unwrapped the pen and assembled it, it didn't come with a converter. I
attempted to install the CON-70; that didn't fit. That disappointed me somewhat,
but it was a disappointment based on my faulty assumption and failure to
investigate the details fully. In the end, though, this wrinkle eventually
proved innocuous. For those wanting to use a converter with this pen, get the
CON-40;  it’s compatible but not included. Until getting this Decimo, I had used fountain pens exclusively for writing
letters, postcards, and journal entries. I tried using the Decimo for those
purposes. The angle at which the clip caused me to point the nib toward the
writing surface created a scratchy, uncomfortable experience. My first reaction
was frustration. Certainly by now you're wondering how on earth this ended up being a five star
review. But read on! It occurred to me that I perhaps wasn't using the Decimo in its ideal
environment. It didn't seem to prefer fountain pen paper (it was very bleed-y
and feather-y on my letter paper, which does not account for all such writing
papers, but still made it useless for me in its originally intended role), it
didn't like being gripped in my bare hand, and the angle at which it met the
writing surface when I was seated just didn't work. So I decided to change all
three of those ingredients to the ""most opposite"" conditions I could create. I took the Decimo and hooked it to my scanner holster, which rides on my belt
for 7.5 walking miles and 25 driving miles every day. It fit perfectly into the
USPS-issued pen loop, unlike so very many other pens that are invariably too
thick or too thin. The next morning I donned the holster and went to work. I
used the Decimo to endorse letters as needed and write notes for the p.m.
manager. The pen adapted very well to writing at unusual and unsteady
angles--when I held the writing surface in one hand and wrote with the other,
specifically. Its ink delivery agreed fabulously with typical envelope paper
and, later in the day, Postal forms such as the 3849 (""We Re-Deliver for
You!""/the peach sheet). It never hard started or bled, even when I filled out
3849s while standing on porches in the sub-freezing winter wind--I was amazed at
the evenness of the ink flow. My gloved hand could still grip and manipulate the
pen effectively, putting it head and shoulders above any other pen I'd ever used
while delivering with gloves on (carriers, you know what it's like trying to
hold those plastic ballpointsfrom your local bank while wearing gloves!). As I continued to use it throughout the day, I reflected on its limitation:
standard Pilot ink cartridges and colors. That no longer seemed like a
limitation, as I'm pretty sure most of the time I'll use black or blue ink,
which establishes the best contrast in most situations. My somewhat unusual conclusion is that this is a somewhat unusual pen: it seems
to thrive on adverse conditions, practical work, and perhaps even a U.S. Postal
Service environment in particular. Carriers: while you won't want to hand this
pen to anyone else to sign with, that's what the other pen loop in your holster
is for! This pen is a workhorse, and I'm happy to have discovered its strengths."
devote63833,"March 7, 2011","I have both fine and broad nibs for this version, saying how much I love this
pen. I purchased the broad nib Decimo from Japan since I wasn't aware of JetPens
and thought that Decimo was not sold in the US. Then, I purchased a fine nib
(nib only) from a fountain pen dealer in the US. Decimo, Fermo, and VP share the
same type of nib so one can swap one nib to another pen's barrel easily or have
multiple nibs for one barrel. Decimo is the feather weight among all three, so I
carry it around with me all the time. Fermo can stay on my desk. It would be fun
if JetPens starts selling the nibs and barrels separately."
Hawaii pen collector,"February 15, 2017","I've used the regular Vanishing Points, but this is my first Decimo. The pearl
white color is absolutely stunning- it's shimmery but understated, very classy.
The nib is buttery-smooth and the pen is comfortable and much lighter than the
regular VP. The click mechanism in so convenient and makes using fountain pens
on-the-go much easier. I highly recommend these pens!"
anthonyjong,"July 11, 2011","I have this white Capless Decimo and a few other Limited edition Pilot capless /
vanishing point.  They are sharing the same type of nibs so I can interchange
different size of nib.  I have fine, medium and broad nib but I really love this
fine nib the most.  The nib is a little bit flexible, so it give me some unique
character when writing with this pen.I carry this pen the most since it have a thinner and lighter barrel and the
retractable nib is very convenience to have."
Little M,"July 31, 2021","I absolutely love this fountain pen. If you’re interested and it is within
your budget, just go for it.I know I can rely on it when it comes to journaling or note-taking, since it has
collected so many good reviews from fountain pen lovers over the years. In fact,
I’m interested in the capless design precisely because I enjoy taking notes on
the go, and I did find traditional fountain pens slightly inconvenient in that
setting.The only difficulty remained for me was to pick a color. I was attracted by the
Burgundy as well, but I’m glad that I settled on the Pearl White in the end.
It is such a subtle and quiet color, perfectly suited for a writing utensil.Don’t forget that this version doesn’t come with a converter, and remember
to order one if the bottled ink is your thing."
una.chung,"March 1, 2018","This is a wonderful pen for writers. I have small hands so other pens I love
tend to be too heavy for long periods of steady writing. This one is really
light and well-balanced. The retractable feature is uncommon in a fountain pen
and is indispensable for people who pause and think or daydream while writing.
The pearly white color is classy and so far I haven’t had problems keeping it
clean from ink. The Japanese F point nib is just finer than a European EF, which
happens to fit my compact, non-cursive writing style. "
fountainpenfwend,"October 6, 2021","I really love this pen! It's a butter smooth writer and isn't fussy about my
writing angle. I find this comfortable for longer writing sessions -- I have
medium hands and write with a fairly loose grip. When ordering this pen from
Jetpens, pay attention to whether the pen includes a converter, as it varies by
color. This pearl white color is just perfect! A little sparkle and sheen, but
not gaudy looking."

Wclar,"April 8, 2016","After owning 4 Fermo VP pens and a black matte FB, I decided to give the Decimo

wriating. Glad I bought this pen, and with the pilot nibs one cannot but have a winner.
Thanks to the folks at JetPens for their fast efficient service and
accommodating manners."
Shlok Shah,"December 3, 2022","Stunning pen, the Pearl White looks great and the nib is silky smooth. Even
though the nib retracts, it does seem to dry out pretty quickly. If I leave it
for a week or so, I have to play around with it to get the ink flowing again.
Not a problem if you use it daily but if you take breaks in between use, it may
get a little annoying."
LisaBDallas,"August 5, 2022","Oh my . . . how I love this pen! The convenience of being able to click a button
and have a quality, clean, smooth, superior fountain pen nib pop out for me to
use immediately is more than I expected. I use cartridges and am on my 4th one
since receiving the pen several weeks ago. (That's because I write a LOT and am
using this one almost exclusively.) I have wanted one of these for a very, very
long time but was afraid to make the investment -- I feared something would go
wrong and I would end up with a so-so pen. If you're on the fence like I was,
and if you think this pen could make a difference to your writing experiences,
go for it. So far, extremely smooth ink flow, no skipping, no dripping, no
nothing other than stellar performance. I'm a happy customer."

TellMyWifiLoveHer,"January 5, 2022","It's frustrating to have a pen hit all the right boxes to be your ""grail pen""
but doesn't write consistently. The air seal when it retracts into the body of
the pen just isn't good. I've tried at least 5-6 different inks to test for
consistency as the culprit, but it keeps coming back to how dry the nib after
getting through a few words. My other gripe is the cartridge (threw the
converter on the shelf for good). Either by design flaw or accident, the
cartridges that I refill with a dropper, rinse, and re-use get air pockets in
them. That means you're rattling it out praying that you don't make the feed &
nib burp ink. I'm starting to consider it a really expensive mistake that I'm
stuck with. "
reese959599,"July 21, 2021","Very happy with the quality of the pen, would buy again 10/10. I wish the pearl

very solid and satisfying, I could definitely just click this thing all day."

Tangle List,"September 9, 2018","My previous 10 count box lasted a little over a year. The last pen I used—the
one that sat in the box for over a year—still performed as expected. No issues
with the ink drying up. I stored the box horizontally during that period of
time, which may have made a difference (I've read elsewhere that storing gel
pens vertically can cause minor ink dispensing issues but can't confirm that
myself). I used half the pens for daily journaling, and gave the other half away as
gifts. Yes, one of the unstated benefits of buying in bulk is that you always
have a small gift on hand. After all, who doesn't appreciate a really nice pen?"

problematic enough that I'll likely look at other options for my next batch."

long-haul writing. When I need to write for more than an hour or two, the grip
section starts to rub against my knuckle uncomfortably. That may be a symptom of
me gripping the pen too tightly. In any event, I am choosing not to deduct any
stars from my rating, because I think the comfort will be sufficient for the

julesmn14,"May 16, 2018","A really good pen but takes a long time to dry which isn't necessarily
noticeable unless using a highlighter. I personally use the zebra mildliners and
I can't highlight over the pen because it will smear but overall one of my
favorite pens."
GodlikeZidane,"April 28, 2018","What really can be said that hasn't already?  These are the best pens out there.
 Period.  I guess my personal insight would include that if you work with triple
copy paper like I do all the time, the last copy will be very weak as the tip is
so fine.  These pens write best with a light touch, and if you need to be
pressing down into the paper with some force, they lose all the elegance that
really make them such a pleasant experience.  The lines are super dark, clean
and sharp, perfect for my very small handwriting.  The pen itself is solid and
doesn't give you that weird vibration that you sometimes get with click pens
(the pilot juice is guilty of this).  I guess my only criticism would be the
grip.  The grip is firm, almost to the point of ""Why is this even here?""  I hold
my pens tight and if the grip was a LITTLE softer it would easily increase my
writing speed and efficiency. The grip is a minor point.  This pen's successes
far outweigh its shortcomings.  Still the best pen out there."
btmiddleton,"July 18, 2017","Quite possibly my favorite pen. And I have been searching for the ""perfect pen""

redge1980,"April 21, 2011","Totally agree that this pen makes a worthy alternative to the Pilot Hi-Tech C

yeesusanna,"November 26, 2008","- Wonderful for everyday note taking- Satisfactory ink- Nice grip- Solid, durable nib (since I myself am a rather heavy writer) There is one thing that bugs me though... when I put the pens upside down or for
too long a period horizontally... the ink kind of slides over on the side, which
screws the last bits of ink when using it to write with. Other than that, a wonderful pen. Off to buy 0.28~!"
sarahdhill,"July 15, 2008","GREATEST PEN ever. I came across it by mistake. Found it in a hotel hallway in

too. Maybe I should just give them this website! I LOVE THE EXTRA FINE POINT."
Coco,"July 18, 2021","The ultimate black pen in my life. Juicy, but the thin tip keeps even small writing clear, and it dries fast enough
that it doesn’t cause smudging.If you use them in an office environment, I recommend wrapping some brightly
colored tape around the barrel to label them with, one of the only weak points
of this pen is that they don’t come with any anti-theft technology. "
brennen.reece,"January 21, 2014","These are amazing pens. I like these as much as the Pilot Hi-Tec-C, but for
different reasons. They feel different and shouldn't be judged as direct
competitors. Warning! I bought a box of apparently fake UM-151s off of Amazon to save a few
bucks. Those are obviously inferior pens. I'll be buying exclusively from Jet Pens from
now on."
Argus,"May 17, 2012","I want to disagree with the reviewer that says this color is not dark enough to
use for business.  I use this pen anywhere I would use a black, or blue-black
pen and am quite happy with it.  It is especially nice to use if there are
several people writing on the same papers, and you can identify your own writing
by color.  It is not quite as distinctive as blue-black in my opinion, but just
subtle enough that few people will notice it unless they know to look for it. Also, I'd like to say that I find the 0.28 and 0.38 pens last much longer than
the 0.5 size pens.  It's quite noticeable to me.  I prefer the 0.38 size
overall.  The 0.28 can be hard to read for some people depending on the lights
or their eyesight, and I avoid the 0.5 just because it runs the ink out too
fast. Great pen!"
lindsay.zaremski,"August 1, 2012","I write incredibly small and the DX in Brown Black (0.38 and 0.28) is my
signature pen. I've tried Hi Tec Cs (in 0.25, 0.3 and 0.4), Pentel Sliccis (in
0.25 and 0.3), and Zebra Sarasas (0.4). Each is a very different writing
experience and each have their strengths. For every day writing, though, my
heart belongs to Signo DX. The tip is very strong; some say it's scratchy, but that makes me think of an
unpleasant sensation. Instead, I'd say it definitely feels firm and precise (but
not grating). Unlike Hi Tec Cs, they don't need to be ""primed"" by scribbling a
bunch before the ink flows evenly. The brown-black ink is gorgeous; it's dark
enough that it doesn't look gimmicky or childish (though I love those as well
:D) but just brown enough that it looks subtly different and has a rich warmth
to it."
walkershurlds,"August 19, 2010","Pen is as sturdy as the blurb says. Good choice if you like having a lot of pen
in your hand. Also comes in a few colors that Slicci doesn't, at least. This one

coffee."

really annoying. Even the slightest bit of anything on the tip will make it
impossible to write with this thing. I got these to make annotations in my textbooks and in the margins of my
research papers, but even on regular paper it picks up small fibers and starts
skipping. If you want to be patient and keep wiping your pen off then these are great, but
they didn't do well for what I wanted. "

Francesca,"February 4, 2021","I originally bought this off black colour along with two other off black
colours—Lavender Black and Bordeaux Black—because of all the hype, the ooh,
ah, wow, surrounding these colours. Well…all these colours are richly
pigmented and vibrant. The ink is dark, but its base is clearly visible. The
Brown Black is similar to the Pilot Juice Coffee Brown and Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel
Vintage Sepia Black. The Bordeaux Black is similar to the Pilot Juice Dark Red
and Zebra Sarasa Clip Gel Vintage Bordeaux Purple. I have no other colour
similar to the Lavender Black. After trying these colours, I realized that one
of each wasn’t enough, so I bought more. The cap is easy to remove and snaps
in place satisfyingly. The cap can also be posted securely as there is a groove
at the end of the barrel for that purpose. The rubber grip is comfortable, and
my fingers don’t slide beyond it. All these three pens are very inky and none
are scratchy."

Mush,"November 15, 2016","I didn't know this was the ink I'd been looking for all my life until it arrived
and I first used it.It's not a light color when viewed on the page, it's black, but just
ever-so-slightly softer than black. There's a hint of the antique to it, the
aged, the revered document.I use it daily in my traveler's notebook, and for all household writing —
lists and notes and cards and such. And not only is the ink a glorious and
subtle color, but the device itself writes flawlessly and comfortably. Once in a
great while I find the tip needs a wipe-off to avoid a blotch, but it's rare.
Generally the ink flows perfectly; and I'm left-handed, so it's possible this
occasional leak is due to how I push or pull the thing across the writing
surface.Lovely shade of ink."

NewDayCC,"June 23, 2016","Nice, deep color and smooth flow of ink."
madisonsearle,"June 9, 2016","After much searching, this is has become my favorite all-purpose pen. I use it
for taking notes in books, for handwritten letters or cards, and for
miscellaneous daily writing -- agendas, book summaries (I recall what I've read
in books better if I summarize them by hand rather than on computer), and
meeting notes, mostly. The point is fine enough for clear annotations in book
margins, but this pen doesn't suffer from the two problems that commonly afflict
fine-point pens: intermittent ink flow and scratchiness. It's easy to write
with, and only two of the 15 or so pens I've used have skipped after months of
steady use. This brown-black is particularly attractive, distinctively different
but not so much as to raise eyebrows in official correspondence. The pens last a
long time, too."
Eckert,"April 18, 2016","Excellent quality for the price - I love the color. I will say I like the

others in this line of Uni-ball gel pens.  I usually do not buy capped pens and

brown Juice Up .4 and I had hoped it would be unique.  So 4 stars only."
joe_hh,"September 28, 2010","Main complaint is that the brown is not dark enough to use on professional
documents. I was hoping it would be really dark, and it is more of a solid
brown."
yfhsueh,"May 25, 2011","Sorry, forgot to add that other reviewers were right: this pen may need a brief
breaking-in period before it writes smoothly (as is true of many fountain pens).
Initially, I thought the pen wrote a bit dry and scratchy. I put it aside. Wrote
a few more times a few days later. After writing the equivalent of a page over
several days, I suddenly realized the pen was feeling very good to use -- it was
writing very smoothly! My point is, don't judge any new fountain pen too
quickly."
yfhsueh,"May 25, 2011","Excellent pen, and I'm glad I bought it from JetPens three weeks ago. I've been
using Pelikan Royal Blue ink in it, with the CON-50 converter, and everything
works great. The converter seats well, and there is no leaking. The grip is very
comfortable for those who hold their pen the right way (as taught in school).
Most important, the nib writes an extremely fine, clean line remarkably smoothly
for a needle-point -- consistent ink flow, no skips in the line, and no problems
laying down ink from the first stroke even when the pen has been sitting a few
days unused. I like that the cap posts; unposted, it is hard to spot on my desk
because it is small and transparent. I like the slightly purple-tinted, clear
plastic -- pretty, and it lets me see how much ink is in the converter. With the
very fine line and large capacity of the converter, one filling from the ink
well writes a long time. This pen is a very good deal! I am thinking of buying
more."
sdearth.le,"August 31, 2012","I've always had trouble with fountain pens laying down too much ink resulting in
bleeding and feathering. Not the case with this extra fine nib. It write well
even on cheap notebook paper. However, it really shines on higher quality paper.
The pen is decent enough. The construction is fairly solid. It's about the same
as the Plumix and I've been using that for a few years now without issue. The
pen is somewhat irrelevant for me though. What I really wanted was the nib. I
get what looks to be about a 0.4mm line width compared to how my 0.4mm Zebra
Sarasa. Works great to use as a nib swap for a nicer pen such as the Prera. "
bob_sieber,"February 27, 2014","A joy to use.  If this pen had been available in the 1930s, the ballpoint would
never have been invented.  It writes so smoothly, you'd think you were writing
on wet glass.  I measured the line width (on Rhodia paper) using a pocket
microscope, and it's 0.22mm. This puts it in the same league as the finest
rollerballs, like the Slicci or the Hi-Tec C.  It never skips, and yet I can
rest it point down on a piece of paper and no ink blob forms.  It has only
happened twice that the nib dried out overnight, and all I had to do was touch
it to a wet paper towel to get it going. The only negatives are that the pen looks cheap (although it is actually fairly
sturdy), it has no pocket clip, and that the grip keeps my fingers a little too
far from the point for my liking.  But those are minor quibbles compared to how
well it performs.  For eight bucks, it's a steal."
sandi,"June 9, 2009","I loooooove this pen! It is very comfortable - not too thick or thin. I love the
fine tip, it is superfine but is also smooth - doesn't skip or snag. I like it
better than the V-pen fine point or the Platinum fountain pens. It is really
solid construction too and I love the screw-on cap which really stays on. I am
definitely going to buy more of these."
npham,"January 18, 2014","For drawing/sketching very fine lines/details, this pen would be great. As many
reviewers have indicated, the nib can be quite scratchy -- especially if you're
not holding the pen at a particular angle. I suspect that the scratchiness might
go away with use over time. For everyday writing, I would NOT recommend this pen. I grew up writing with
fountain pens -- all either Japanese or Chinese made -- and have always
preferred a fine/extra fine nib on my fountain pens. The Pilot Penmanship has a
needle-point thinness. As some other reviewers, I've never come across a nib
this fine. Being that fine, writing with it is challenging as it is very
scratchy unless one writes slowly. I prefer a wetter -- and especially, smoother
-- line that what I've seen so far with this pen. As for smoothness, the Fine
Nib Platinum Preppy is far smoother. (To produce a finer line, I write with the
nib upside down). The other advantage of the Preppy is that you can vary the
thickness of the line as well by rotating the barrel slightly.  One last thing, I also did not find the triangular grip on the Penmanship very
helpful. I've always gripped pens the way one's supposed to. But I find the
indented grip of the Penmanship makes the grip diameter too small for comfort.  I hope that helps someone trying to research for a suitable pen -- like I have
:). Good luck with your search!"
hatefulmoviecritic,"March 31, 2012","I have yet to find another fountain pen that writes as thin a line as this pen
(I'm not saying there isn't one, and my search has not been exhaustive by any
stretch of the imagination).  Maybe its my fault that I write too small, but
this pen works great for me.  Be sure to fill it with a fairly dark ink, since
it writes so thin, you won't hardly be able to see any light colored inks."
Brendan,"January 27, 2015","Got this pen for sketching and wow, it really delivers. I converted it to an
eyedropper by adding some silicone grease to the threads, inked it up with
Platinum Carbon Black and started using it. Super fine line. Super consistent.
It can sit for 2 weeks and then start right up with no skipping and no
scribbling or shaking to get it started. I have never experienced this kind of
consistency with any fountain pen.My only complaint is that the form factor makes it a little too conspicuous to
use in my office. I don't mind using this unorthodox looking thing for drawing
and sketching, but breaking it out to take notes in a meeting is going to draw
attention. But you can see for yourself what it looks like in the pictures."
chocorocket,"May 25, 2011","I love this pen!!!! After reading the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy
it, but I am so glad I did! The extra fine nib is wonderful to work with, the
ink flow is perfectly even, and very little to no scratchiness, even on notebook
paper. I am left handed and the grip doesn't bother me at all. This is my
favorite fountain pen of all time; I think I will buy another."
djkhimtaka,"July 22, 2014","This fountain pen lays down the finest line I have ever seen made by a fountain
pen. I love it! I was originally intending to make this into an eyedropper, but
the threaded section is too short for me to be comfortable with that. It would
likely leak everywhere. But the cartridge it comes with is open enough that you can simply use an
eyedropper or pipette to fill it with your own choice of bottled ink, no
converter needed (except for flushing the pen clean)."
arlen,"December 14, 2011","This pen has its faults. Yet I keep coming back to it, because it's a cool and
comfortable design. The point is scratchy. One should expect a superfine nib to be scratchy, and
this one is very, very fine. But my next finest pen, a Sailor HighAce Neo, is
worlds smoother. It's also prone to skipping and slow starting when using a
less-than-sturdy writing support, like a folder. I assume that's mainly due to
the fineness as well, and it's flawless on a desk surface. I get a lot of nib creep, to the point of having a few tiny ink spots in the
cap. This isn't a real problem, but it's also not present on many other pens. In any case, the shape is really as awesome as it seems it might be. The
three-sided grip part is smooth and comfy (for a lefty, no less) and it's just
an interesting pen. I'll be interested in how the black body compares, but IMHO
this pen is worth the price. "
mrsvickigriffin,"September 25, 2012","Iam avowed fountain pen junkie. A ex trashed my favorite one years ago and I've
been looking for a replacement ever since while months ago at a local store I
found a pilot plumix I was unable to find ink for it so I sadly tossed it. Then
I found jetpens.com and rebought that pen as well as this one. I LOVE IT! I've only had to start writing and with in seconds and it writes
beautifully it doesn't skip and the ink flow is excellent as well I would highly
recommend it to anyone!"
scharr,"December 5, 2011","Agree with the other reviewers to allow this pen a breaking-in period. At first
I hated it; it was scratchy with stingy and uneven ink flow. But after a few
days of writing, deliberately applying writing pressure to flex the nib, and
writing on scratch paper (maybe the rough tooth of the paper helped) it really
smoothed out and opened up.  It's now my favorite pen.  It writes with a very
consistent and fine line, it weighs next to nothing, and the triangular grip is
very comfortable."
leebcgfx,"March 11, 2015","Five stars for this pen due to the low cost, and how well it draws. I use it for
art only. There are other pens I use to write with. This one was bought in order
to do line work when I didn't feel like using my dip pens.It is a very nice tool to have lying on my desk when I want to sketch an idea. I
opened the package and placed the cartridge in, and it started putting down a
perfect line and hasn't dried on the nib at all. There's no coaxing it to flow,
it just draws every time.I've had it for several weeks, and have used almost all the ink, and still no
problems.In case you don't know...I would only put Fountain Pen ink in it. There's
several brands that are water resistant that should work well in this pen."
dnchen8,"December 5, 2011","This pen is pretty scratchy and I've been using mine for at least half a year
now. Also converted into an eyedropper and tried Quink and a Waterman ink and
both weren't as good as the stock cartridge. It does produce a nice fine line
and I like the grip and design. All in all though, I prefer my Platinum Preppy."
tongvichit,"January 19, 2010","After reading all the great reviews I thought I would buy this as an all-purpose
pen. It's really pretty (except for when ink splats on the cap) and the nib
looks so elegant. It writes SO fine and seems to variate on its own (like insta
caligraphy!) but sometimes the line is too thin, meaning I can barely see it and
gets scratchy! It takes a long time to reboot after being stored. When you first
start writing it skips and stops and makes super thin lines mixed with much
thicker lines. After a while, it gets back to normal and has a really delicate
variation of lines and writes really cleanly, turning into the perfect pen I've
been hearing about. It is prone to splattering ink when handled too roughly so
take care! Overall a nice fountain pen for the price!"
xoxotoe,"January 21, 2021","I am not a fan of EF nibs in general, let's just be honest. I write big and bold
and heavy-handed, and an extra fine nib doesn't make any sense at all for me. I
hate the scratchiness on the paper. That all said and out of the way, this pen
is wonderful. It writes easily on the first stroke, doesn't skip, and won't blob
or leak. It's really not for me, because of personal preferences, and I honestly
won't use it very often, but if you prefer a fine nib, this is the cheap
fountain pen of dreams. It won't let you down, and it's a workhorse, a perfect
everyday pen. I love that it's lightweight, it's entirely see-through, the cap
is tiny, and it's clipless: all pros in my opinion. It's EXACTLY what I want in
a fountain pen. Now if they would just make it in M or B, it would be perfect."
squidhearts,"December 15, 2017","Lovely weirdo squid shaped pen that is a perfect eyedropper. This was my daily
driver pen for about a year, until I lost it, and it was a pleasure all the way
through. My second one has a nib that gives more feedback OR my standards have
changed; I’m not sure.I always keep this inked with various blue green inks. The huge ink capacity and
the ultra fine line the nib lays down means that I’ve never, ever, actually
*had* to refill this pen. I always got bored of the ink and wanted a slightly
different blue in there way before I actually ran out of ink.The fine line is SO fine that this pen will write on basically anything without
ghosting.The only thing I did to convert it to an eyedropper was adding a little o ring
on the lip. The barrel screws on water tight without any help, but for some
reason, mine leaked around the lip. Since I added the o ring, there’s been
zero issues. No burping, no leaking, no exploding, etc etc.A wonderful pen, exquisitely clear."
charlybu,"June 17, 2015","This is the best little pen! My husband got it for me. It is a similar ergonomic
shape to the Pilot Plumix, but a little more streamlined. This pen fits the hand
so nicely and sits right into that perfect 45 degree angle. I like a really fine
pen (Zebra Sarasa .3 is a favorite non-fountain, if that gives you a clue) and
this is a really fine nib. It will be slightly scratchier because it is so fine,
but just compare it to a Platinum Preppy Extra Fine and the Penmanship will feel
smooth as butter! This pen even got me back into sketching after 15 or so years.
It is a superb pen for sketching! It is nice and wet so that it can keep up and
the extra fine line makes it great for not laying down too much ink from the get
go as I am prone to do. I like to use this and a broader pen, kind of like you
would with different hardnesses of drawing pencils. The grip puts it a a great
angle for sketching, too. This is a little work horse. Great quality pen. I'm
getting a couple for my sons for their school work, they're gonna love them!"
suncityphoto,"September 9, 2013","I'm so happy with this pen! I got the EF and it is truly the finest line of ant
FP Ive used. Not that Im a FP afecionado. I use the pen for sketching in a
journal and I was pretty unhappy with the EF version of the Lamy Safari. Not
having done sufficient research on the differences between European nibs and
Japanese I learned EF in Germany is like Medium in Japan..but EF in Japan is
like a crow quill nib dip pen! Really fine, just what I wanted. I've had the pen for 3 hours so can't report on the durability but for starters
I installed the sample cartridge and it wrote beautifully immediately. Perfect,
no skipping, botching, etc., Ive only tested it on good Bristol so far but I'm
pretty sure the ink in the Pilot cartridge will perform well on lesser paper. no
bleeding, feathering so far. Dries really fast. For this price?..I'm amazed. Ordering a few more.  Read other reviews here about scratchy nib..well, the is definately feed back
from the nib but, it's still very smooth, writes perfect in all
directions..punching, pulling, sideways..I'm use to dip pens so scratchiness is
not an issue for me. In fact Infeel that you get better control with the
scratchiness and that is perfect for drawing, inking lines. Totally recommend this pen. "
lesliebrenden,"July 11, 2012","LOVE IT!!Great price!I bought the black one also.  Both are great and write a superfine skip-free
line.I think that I should stock up on a them."
nairyasmin,"March 31, 2012","I really  like this pen: great value for the money.  The extra fine may seem
scratchy, but that's not aytpical for extra fine nibs, especially since this one
is stainless steel.  My one issue is the ink seems to spatter from the nib  into
the cap. Perhaps that's typical of all pens, but it's really noticeable in a
clear pen like this.   "
Janis1Rae,"February 26, 2012","This pen is great.  I love a very fine line in my writing and this pen has it. 
The purple ink is very beautiful and the pen writes extremely smoothly. I am
left handed and the pen fits my hand perfectly."
wingdingcallaling,"January 31, 2012","I simply love this pen! I have very small handwriting and have searched for
years for such a fine nib. I settled for pigma pens and gel pens, and used other
fountain pens upside down, but longed for a fountain pen's expressive ink flow.
Finally found it- love at first stroke! The clear body pens write better than
the black body pens for some odd reason. And The CON-50 converter is ok, but I
found the nib too fine for the CON-20 to be able to draw in enough ink. In the
end, because I use it daily, I stick to the proprietary ink cartridges and save
my other thicker tipped nib pens to indulge in ink variety. Only minor flaws to note: the screw top, which disrupts quick jotting of ideas
or pictures. And if you drop the pen, the ink drops will show inside the clear
cap. But these are minor things in a pen I enjoy using very much."
janelle.rz,"January 6, 2012","Very nice pen. I use this pen every day I have many vintage pens but I grab this
one. I love the ergonomic design of the barrel. And with a little pressure the
nib does give a little flex. Over all the pen is good for everyday writing and
the nib is so fine that I can even do some of my crosshatching work with it.
Very nice pen worth 9 dollars"
gweb_world,"September 10, 2010","Excellent pen for the money! I find the ""ergo grip"" a little slippery in the
clear plastic, at least compared to the similar grip on the matte black Lamy
Safari (haven't compared it to the opaque Penmanship.) I like the slightly
scratchy nature of this Extra Fine nib: it has more of a fountain pen feel than
the wider Lamy Extra-Fine, meaning that it provides enough resistance that you
can vary line width & darkness to a certain degree by varying pressure & speed
in order to get a degree of a quill or calligraphy look. Otherwise, it writes a
super-thin line, similar to a rollerball 0.3/0.25, at least when using Noodlers'
Ink in a Pilot Con-50 converter."
nnavarra,"August 1, 2010","1st of all, one must remember you\'re paying not much for this pen. This being
said it is the thinnest nib I have ever encountered. Though plastic, it\'s a
hard plastic with a solid construction. The ink has yet to chunk up - but I\'ve
always used Pelikan ink in all my pens. I\'ve experienced no leaks (yet) like
others and it\'s hung out in my purse being relatively abused and flopped
around. It is so thin I did notice that it is a bit scratchy on most pieces of
paper - but considering it\'s finer than my gel ink Pilot RT which is at .38MM,
I can\'t complain. The ergonomic grip is the basic triangle grip on many other
pens - you can check out if you like it. I\'m left handed and I find it very
comfortable. Overall, for the price you can\'t beat what you\'re getting."
SlowLoris,"June 22, 2010","I love this pen, with its extra fine nib, especially on very smooth, high
quality paper. Unfortunately, mine has developed a persistent leak where the nib
is inserted into the body. I'll order another, but I'm a little disappointed in
the quality. Then again, I've crammed this pen into an over-stuffed bag and
taken it on several flights, and it may not have been designed for that kind of
abuse."
epolsen1967,"March 22, 2021","I really wanted to hate this penI bought it to get an xf nib I could swap with my other pilot pensIt is ugly to look at but is super comfortable in my hand and has become my go

rachelewheeler,"January 31, 2017","I love this pen! Specifically, I love this nib, but the entire pen is great.
I've never had an issue with feathering, and I've used it on many different
types of paper. It does get scratchy sometimes, even after the trial period, but
that's probably more user error than anything. I prefer light, plastic bodies,
but it's very durable (more than my Kakuno), and I love that the cap twists on,
it helps prevent cracking (better than my Kakuno lmao). "
Separisa,"October 11, 2015","I've never had EF pen before, and all positive feedbacks helped me to choose the
right one =) It's absolutely amazing, not scratchy and dry at all from the very
beginning being really needle like thin at the same time. And uses inks very
slowly due to thin trace - the same amount of inks I use with medium nib for a
week will last in this pen for ages, really))"
DNioi72,"May 28, 2015","Unbelievable.  I bought this fountain pen for what—that price?  It writes
better than any fountain pen I ever owned (Pelikan, Sailor, too many to
remember).  It doesn't leak, yet it's not dry when you unscrew the cap—it
writes every time, no licking the point, no shaking the pen.  I like to write in
bed lying down—the ink even flows uphill!!  I bought 2 more—what happens if
the factory goes down?  I should get a couple more spares. About me.  I'm a lefthander who uses an extra fine nib for journaling and
drawing (cartoons).  This pen is terrific, particularly if you use good quality
heavier weight paper.  If you use cheaper, thinner paper, the ink will bleed
through (a characteristic of cheaper paper).  Also, an extra fine nib is a bit
of a specialty item—you may want a different size nib for your different style
or requirement. Jet Pens.  I found them through sheer blind luck.....someone was blogging about
them.  That was my lucky day.  Great people.Stuart  "
Charis,"January 14, 2015","To call this an ""ergo grip"" is a bit of a misnomer -- it's a hard plastic piece
that happens to have some contours in it, and it feels a little awkward in my
hands, as though that area should be a bit larger and have some give.  The nib
is a true Japanese extra fine, seriously narrow and allowing for very small
printing (comparable with my 0.3 Zebra Sarasa gel pens), but a bit scratchy. I'm
using it with a cleaned-out Pilot cartridge refilled with J. Herbin ink.  For
price, smoothness, and comfort in the hand, I'd go for the extra-fine Platinum
Preppy over this one, but if I want a truly superfine line I'll come back to the
Penmanship."
Hayabusa,"October 24, 2014","This is currently my favorite. I can't believe how thin is the writing. I am
always partial to extra fine nib, but most ""extra-fine"" nib pens cannot come
close to this one. The triangle body also helps with my attempt to have a
readable handwriting. <^_^>"
Nagi,"October 23, 2014","I absolutely love to draw with this pen!It was quite frustrating trying to start this pen (as with other fountain pens),
and it took some time to learn how to use it, but I just can't go back to
standard multiliners after drawing with this. My lines look smooth and never
skip. It can produce very, very thin lines, and the better the paper, the better
the result.The ink that comes with it (in the cartridge form) is off-black, but I
personally have no problem with it. If you plan to draw often with this pen, I
recommend buying more cartridges or a converter to extend the ink supply. I've
already used two cartridges myself so far, and the pen's performance has stayed
constant all this time.I don't foresee this pen giving in any time soon, but when the time comes, I'll
definitely be buying another."
sapeters731,"October 18, 2014","For the price these pens are great.  I ordered two of them for sketching, and
they work well.  as they are clear it makes it ideal to use colored inks."
engage,"October 6, 2014","I'm a heavy journal writer and visionary that write's 90% of things down. This
is a great pen to write with while it lasted (1 month), but if you write A LOT
you will find yourself replacing the ink cartridge and realizing that the
plastic is very very cheaply made to the point where the part where you unscrew
the end of the pen to replace the ink cartridge has cracked! I had high hopes
for this pen, but now I see the reason why it's priced at this level. I will be
investing in a better fountain pen that's maybe made of metal."
thegrammarjedi,"March 26, 2014","I absolutely adore this pen.  It has quickly become my standard writer. The extra fine nib writes really smoothly, like a dream.  Some people have
mentioned it as being too fine--I suppose it depends on how tiny you write.  I
have small handwriting, and this pen allows me to compress it while still being
perfectly legible and crisp.  The line is smooth and consistent, with no
variation.  I've only experienced occasional scratchiness when I'm writing
really fast.  It's definitely not loud scratchiness, either.  The nib is also
easy to pop out and clean if necessary.  Finally, ink lasts much longer in the
Penmanship than it does in my Plumix, due to the extra fine nib.  It makes it an
ideal candidate for situations where you might have to work on cheap copy
paper. The body is light plastic.  I love the clearness coupled with the Con-50
converter.  You can really see how much ink you have left.  The lightness is
also a pro for me as I have small hands. The triangular grip is very
comfortable, and I have had no trouble taking hours of lecture notes without any
hand strain at all. After trying out this pen and the Pilot Plumix, I have decided to get a Pilot
Metropolitan to try out a medium nib.  I would highly recommend this Penmanship
to someone trying to decide if they want to get into fountain pens, though. 
It's half the cost of the Metropolitan, works great even on crappy paper, and
you can always use it for nib swapping if you decide you want to continue in the
hobby."
ctyler,"November 14, 2013","Okay, I just got my Pilot Penmanship and after using it for some notes today,
well let's just say this pen is reporting for heavy duty. I am going to have to
buy a couple more simply to put some other inks in it for visual notetaking
purposes. Yes, I still love my Hi-Tec-C Coleto and Uni-Ball Signo UM-138 and
UM-131 0.4 mm, but for an inexpensive fountain pen, well, this definitely
works.I will see what happens when I put in the converter and use my Herbin and
Diamine inks, but as for now, this is a great entry level pen...or for me, a
great daily pen without the nervousness of losing an expensive pen or one of my
students (I have an increasing number of pen geeks around me) deciding to ""find""
my pen."
greenbr,"October 31, 2013","I love fountain pens that write with a very very fine line that to me is very
beautiful. I've discovered that other brands have so-called EF (extra fine) nibs
that are what most people would consider a medium (M) line. This brand's EF
produce what to me is a truly extra fine line. EF lines are great for making
notations in a manuscript. You fit so much more into a margin - and it's all
legible. To me, the EF line also is so much more elegant than a thick line - but
I know that's a matter of personal preference. However, another benefit to EF
line fountain pens is that your ink lasts longer - you are using so much less of
it! I have 5 of these Pilot fountain pens that I use with various ink colors. I
purchased the accompanying converter for each and can refill my pens with my
fave premium inks. These are probably my fave writing pens. I like my Pelikan
(my most costly pen) but its ""fine"" line is (see above). "
kadi.ashby,"August 2, 2013","Along with Sailor and Platinum's desk pens, this is one of the finest nibs you
can find below about ~$120 or without getting a special grind by a nibmeister.
It is remarkably smooth for the price point and teensy tiny size of the nib. 
It's not as smooth as my Mottishaw xxxf, but it's by no means scratchy. I'm not fond of the ergonomic grip, but it is interchangeable with other
lower-end Pilot pens like the Metropolitan, 78G, Plumix, and my favorite, the
Prera.  The only real problem with this pen is that the tip is so small if you
remove the nib and feed for cleaning it's very difficult to place it back on the
body in the proper position.  If you put this nib in another body without the
tripod grip section this is not an issue.  Overall I can wholeheartedly
recommend this pen. "
rahsyk,"June 7, 2013","Oh my goodness, I can't believe how much I love this pen! I'm just starting to
get into fountain pens and this was recommended as a nice starter. I bought it
and put the Pilot purple ink cartridges in it because I thought that would be
fun. I had originally thought to have it around to take notes. As an artist, I
couldn't resist trying out some pen doodles with it. I was shocked at how smooth
and neat the lines were. Such a lovely fine point and even flow. As soon as I'm
able, I'm going to buy another to load black ink into and make it into my new
sketching and inking pen. I'm very happy I bought this amazing pen. And for a
great price, too!"
ftovar,"May 7, 2013","As many of you, I don't write reviews. So, I guess I'm a bit excited about this
pen to feel like writing one now. Possibly too soon since I just got it last
night. I was hesitant to get it at first because of some of the issues mentioned by
others and also not expecting much of it because of its cheap price/appearance.
But because I've been searching for that EF nib that would lay thinner lines
than the Germans' EF, I went for it with a ""It-wouldn't happen-to-me""
confidence. I inserted the cartridge that came with it without paying attention to their
instruction that recommended inserting it with the nib pointing up. What the
heck! What difference would it make? I don't know if it made a difference but
the pen refused to work and after a while the idea of the occasional ""lemon""
that others had mentioned crossed my mind. I restrained myself from using forceful methods to make it work. Not pressing
down, bending of the nib, no blades and no pin tips on the channel for me. All
those would have defeated the purpose of getting a nice EF. But I did the following and worked: I placed the nib under the running faucet to
get the mantle(?) wet. I guess dipping the nib in water would had worked as
well. Then I rubbed the channel side of the nib against a paper towel/napkin to
absorb the water and in the process pull the ink in by capillary action. I kept
touching it until the ink started to stain the napkin. After that, and after
scribing a little, the ink went full strength and this pen has ben delightful.
Amazing. Together with it, I also bought a Tachikawa fine nib -which recommends inserting
the cartridge upside down- and it turned out to lay lines even thinner than this
Pilot Penmanship. I cannot imagine what their EF would do. But this one skips a
bit. Maybe after some use it would get smother. Essentially, I've found the EF nib that I wanted for drawing/sketching and at a
great price."

RoysterSB,"October 5, 2010","This is one of my favorites. I've noted the same difference bewteen this and
Penmanship with the black body: the two feel different, and the writing is
scratchier. this should not make any difference, of course, since it's just the
nib, but my experience jibes witheveryone else's.  I love this pen, and I love how others envy it ;). I think I'm going to convert
one of my Penmanships, though a $20 kit for a $7 pen is a bit hard to stomach."
Panzon,"July 17, 2010","I recently got the black Penmanship, and I liked it so much that I decided to
get a clear one as well. While the transparent body with its internally molded
facets is quite attractive, overall, I don't like this version of the Penmanship
as well as the black.  First, the cap and body do not thread onto the grip as well-- this is something
to do with the plastic. The parts are ""draggy"" and squeak when they are threaded
together. I found this so annoying, I finally wiped a little silicone grease on
the threads. Second, the nib on this pen writes dryer (the black ink looks gray) and is more
scratchy. This is a very fine nib, which I like, but the ""writing feel"" of this
pen is distinctly different from the black version. And finally, one reviewer mentioned a leak where the nib unit joins the grip-- I
can see ink right on the verge of seeping out here on my pen. Of course, I can't
say whether the black pen has this same problem, because the plastic isn't
transparent. No ink has actually seeped out yet, but I've only been using the
pen for a day."

back on when finished - so, if you are switching between pens you are more
likely to leave it uncapped, and so its more likely to dry out and skip (ive had
to dip the pen in water to get it going again). A good pen but not as dazzling
as the preppies."
catbuddha,"September 25, 2009","Thought I would try this one just for fun though wasn't expecting much for the
price.What a wonderful surprise to find that it writes well. Thin, thin line and very
trustworthy.Doesn't skip. It's fun to write with and I find myself using it more and more.
Very glad I bought it!"
pierrewilli,"August 29, 2009","Of all the fountain pens I own, this is my favorite."
luckyyun,"August 13, 2009","very nice pen. it is extra fine nib, but you will get used to it soon. it makes
me keep writing!!!"
archi_shih,"August 3, 2009","Just received the pen and love it so far. It is light. It is good looking. And
it writes very well. The nib is extra fine. Hope pilot will release fine nib
version soon."
fstgeorge,"July 8, 2009","Very nice fountain pen! My order took only a day to arrive! This pen color is
the better option in my opinion because it is clear and allows you to tell when
the ink it running out. The nib is extremely fine- I compared it to another pen which was marked as a
.005mm and this pen writes in an identical line width- So this pen would be
great for detailed drawings! thanks Jetpens!"
sduckett48,"April 13, 2009","Really love it. That extra extra fine tip is fantastic. Got the clear pen just a
few days back. Came back to get 2-3 more. Really bummed to see the SOLD OUT.PS: does it come in any other colors."
sergienko.alexander,"April 28, 2021","Very good pens, we buy them because of the EF nibs. We use them in Metropolitan
and other pens."
chrispmoellering,"January 7, 2021","I bought this solely for the nib, to complete my dream of an extra-fine
Metropolitan. Swapping the feeds was straightforward and I am very pleased with
the result, giving me a very fine (and yet quite smooth) experience with my
Metropolitan."
hershey.andrew.c,"February 26, 2020","The finest of lines. Haven't measured, but absolutely beautiful fine-ness. Been
using on regular notebook paper, so I would expect even better results on
quality trees. No scratching, nib glides. Sturdy construction, comfy natural
grip. Using with Con-40 converter with no issues"
gray6580,"February 10, 2020","For the price this is a very good pen. It writes smoothly and ink feeds evenly.
Would recommend to anyone who loves fountain pens."
srph17,"June 22, 2019",I like ultra fine tip so this is perfection
black1972chevelle,"January 22, 2018","For a cheap inexpensive pen it is phenomenal. It writes better than my twsbi
Eco. If your on the fence buy it. It also makes a great eyedropper. It's great for making the fine lines in drawing or for writing small which I do.
Be aware a extra fine on a Japanese pen is finer than an average American one.
That's why I specifically bought it. I love, love ,love how fine a line it makes. The nib is also super smooth for an
extra fine. "
mzgillin,"May 1, 2017","I was looking for a fine-point fountain pain that would produce a line
comparable to Pilot’s Hi-Tec-C 0.3 gel pen. I love the Hi-Tec, but as I do a
lot of ink-and-watercolor illustrations, I needed a pen with waterproof ink that
wouldn’t run once I applied the paint.The Pilot Penmanship has been an amazing solution. I absolutely love the line
and the weight of the pen body itself. At times the ink flow stops and I have to
flip it over and press the nib to a paper for a second, which makes it work
again. That said, once I give the pen another proper cleaning, I’m sure that
won’t be as much of a problem. Be sure to buy the matching converter if
you’re planning on filling it with a different ink—I use De Atramentis
Document Ink, which is waterproof.All in all, it's ended up as one of my absolute favorite fountain pens that I
wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
seth,"February 18, 2017","Works as advertised.   Line width is approx 0.3mm to 0.4mm.  I am using it with
Sailor Storia Night Blue pigment ink and it seems perfectly fine, but the cap
must be kept on if unused for more than a few 10s of seconds."
lisayng,"December 27, 2016","I love this pen! It has become my main pen for my journal, both for writing and drawing. I love it's' clean, very fine line. My.only complaint is
that the cartridges don't go very far, so be sure to order plenty when you buy
this pen."
Yvonne C,"September 5, 2016","Wow. This inexpensive pen has outperformed many $100+ pens i have tried, right
out of the box. I normally do not write reviews, but this product needs
recognition! It is SO smooth, even though the nib is extra fine. Really extra
fine ! The thinnest line i was ever able to get from any fountain pen. Total
thumbs up, Pentel! And kudos for puting this quality into an affordable package.
I just wish there were other nib sizes and styles!"
yang.anuson,"January 5, 2016","This is one of my first fountain pens and I love it, I'm just worried about
forgetting it some where then sitting on it or even dropping it then stepping on
it and then it's gonna break."
Antaresia,"January 2, 2016","I bought this a while ago, it quickly became my favorite.  The nib is extra
fine, it writes finer than my fine Kakuno and fine Prera. "
lhanneman,"December 30, 2015","My first fountain pen. I love the extra fine nib, can be scratchy on cheap
paper. Ink lasts much longer than the fine nib even. I like the clear body so
you can see the ink flow. Allows you to write softer than with a gel pen, which
helps my hands while scribbling notes for hours in class. Grip is slick, but
never slips because of the ergonomic ridges. Excellent everyday carry pen. I
have it in my backpack, have tumbled it around a bit, and everything is still
strong and is definitely not leaking.  Beware: this is an entry point for fountain pen addiction, purchase with
caution. "
tom.ireland,"December 23, 2015","I love the extra fine nib. I am considering some other fine or extra fine tipped
fountain pens because this one writes so well"
rmazariegos,"December 17, 2015",Love this pen! Thinking about purchasing at least two more!

much"
rrregena,"October 22, 2015","love the super fine line......love. no skipping, smooth as can be. I would
prefer a snap cap, but hey, that is nit picking"
joseph,"October 19, 2015","I bought this only to use the nib in a Prera, whose nib I mangled, but I like
the feel of this pen so much, I decided not to switch the nib. The EF nib is
surprisingly smooth, and the ergonomic body is great. "
buddydusty,"October 5, 2015","This is a fantastic pen.  I use it almost daily.  It is a joy to use.How it feels in my hand and how it writes on paper are both wonderful.At one point the pen sort of dried out on me and JetPens was very helpful with
sending me instructions for how to revitalize the pen.  Thank you, JetPens!At this price this is the best fountain pen you can buy.  You won't be
disappointed."
John Jon Jo,"September 29, 2015","This is a good pen to use when I ink photos, but the cap is very hard to take
off sometimes."
elacartier,"September 8, 2015","If you want a seriously fine nib, get this.It took a very little bit of breaking in. Maybe a half hour to an hour of
drawing with it? Once it has some use, it is a quite nice pen for fine fine
lines."
lpmcconchie,"August 28, 2015",Very responsive pen for ink sketching and watercolors.
yuni,"August 20, 2015","Very scratchy.  I have close to a dozen Pilot fountain pens, and this is the
only one with a nib I didn't really like.  "
drbills,"August 10, 2015","For over 50 years I have tried writing with various fountain pens. This is the
first fountain pen I have ever enjoyed writing with that entire time."
Maja Blanco,"July 10, 2015","It's a bit scratchy for my tastes.  I wish I would have bought one with a medium
nib.  Outside of that, the pen is beautiful demonstrator.  I gave it over to my
nephew for his first experience into fountain pens."
agentgrey86,"June 23, 2015","Scratchy, leaky and... pretentious?Got it for ED conversion capabilities, but when I first filled it, the pen
completely rejected basic notebook paper at first. Got a few lines written
before the nib would start picking-up fibers and jamming badly. Not only that,
droplets of ink would form on the side of the nib. I then applied some silicone
grease to the sides, and that mitigated the dripping for the most part. The
thing would still only write on my higher-quality sketching paper, but still
slowly oozed ink unexpectedly. Perhaps I got a factory mishap, but for now mine
will serve as my learning-pen for using microfiber and/or mylar."
EA Nanes,"June 18, 2015","The EF nib is precise. It was designed to teach Japanese students penmanship, as
I find it good for kanji writing practice. While it is understandably a scratchy
nib, it actually writes pretty wet. :)"
wilbur_dee,"June 18, 2015",This pen worked great right outta the box.No fiddling around needed. I love it!
Angie D,"June 14, 2015","It's a great beginner FP but the nib could be a bit dry and scratchy for
starter. I suggest before filling it with ink or even use it, unassemble it and
clean it with distilled water. Let it dry then re-assemble it. Ink flow smoothly
and less scratch during writing. Oh btw don't let the ink sit for too long in
the pen or it will stain and need solution to remove it, especially
red/pin/purple color ink."
jeokitty,"June 6, 2015","I love this pen!I bought this pen on a whim, and it has immediately become my favourite fountain
pen. The nib is truly extra fine and writes wonderfully, does not skip, very
even ink flow. Also, the ink flow is not too wet. The pen body design is simple
and beautiful. I've been using the Pilot ink cartridge and was also pleasantly
surprised with the intensity of the black. Highly recommended if you're looking
for a simple fountain pen that can write very fine."
jkdnt,"June 2, 2015","   This is a great pen. Easy to use and comfortable to grip. I only miss a
pocket clip. The fine point produces a clean, neat, line. I am very pleased with
 the pen."
c562blank,"May 9, 2015","I have shared my pen with many of the members of the Calligraphy group I belong
to in Los Angeles and Orange County, California !  This is the BEST ""Extra Fine
Nib"" I've ever written with ... and the plus is it uses all of the Pilot
cartridges, which come in a dozen different colors !  I will be buying at least
14 more of these pens, as gifts, for the OC Regional Board."
sweetheartgerbils,"May 7, 2015",A great pen.
mkurschner,"April 25, 2015",Works great with all the colored ink I ordered. 
abjonespsyd,"April 13, 2015",These leaked all over.
Phoenixdown,"April 4, 2015","This pen is nice because it's more like a calligraphy pen and less like a normal
fountain pen. The EF nib is also super extra fine, and if you're light enough,
you might be able to get some hairlines. Drawbacks include leaking and cheaply
made plastic. But hey, for such an inexpensive pen, you might as well get a few.
If you're just starting out with fountain pens, definitely get this."
macrane5,"March 24, 2015","I've ordered this item before, and love how fine the nib is!  It is a bit
scratchy, depending on the paper, but not a problem for me.  I'm always happy
with my JetPens' purchases, and prices are great!  Orders are processed quickly,
too! Thanks!"
Carla,"March 22, 2015","I was hoping for it to be smooth, it was not.It was my first fountain pen, very scratchy."
Shopper,"March 18, 2015","Really impressed with the way this pen feels and writes. The tiny cap is a
little odd, but the pen itself is delightful."
kpsmd,"March 14, 2015",Helps make my writing much better somehow. Enjoyable to use and comfortable.
evilenabler,"March 11, 2015","This is a great pen, and one of my first fountain pens. It writes smoothly on
the paper, and has perfect ink flow with the ink cartridge that came with it. My
only complaint is that the line it produces is a little too fine for me. But
that's ok. I wasn't sure what kind of nib I would like because until now I'd
been using mostly gel pens, and I like to have a bold line. I think however that
this is a good pen to use on thinner paper as it doesn't put down as much ink as
my other pens. Overall, it's a great pen and I can't complain in any way about
it. I'll be buying a converter to use with this pen."
l0llichupap,"March 8, 2015",Excellent!
ksspeicher,"March 3, 2015","Love this pen, the only thing that could make this better is the cap. It screws
on and does that well but it makes a grating sound that I can't stand. As for
the pen it has great flow, writes dry and so far hasn't leaked."
Margan,"March 2, 2015","I love the extra fine nib- it's smooth and thin, making writing in the margins
simple and small handwriting legible. The only problem is that you can't bring
it around; it leaks into the cover."
photographerleia,"February 18, 2015","I've waited to review this pen as I wasn't very sure about it from the get go. 
Initially I was disappointed, because I didn't realize how fine the EF nib on
this pen really was.  I bought this at the same time as the Pilot Plumix, and
figured that the Plumix would get more use.  Interestingly enough, the opposite
has been true.  In the past month I've used the Penmanship at least once a day
(mainly for journal writing) and the Plumix sits about barely used.  Loaded with
blue-black cartridges, it writes beautifully on the Kokuyo Campus High Grade MIO
Notebook.  I don't ever foresee myself completely becoming an EF/F nib person,
but this pen has certainly made me realize the charm that EF nibs can have.  If
you are on the fence about whether or not to get the penmanship, I'd advise
going for it."
cyber.istari,"January 16, 2015","Wow! Still can't believe how much I love this pen. Wanted something a baby step
up from my Platinum Preppys, it was this or the Platinum Plasir. So glad I went
with this. The nib is as fine as the gel pens I use (.38), and very smooth. The
screw on cap is a bit odd, but I'm happy to deal."
homeyo13,"January 15, 2015","Nice pen so far, the nib is very fine, and I now know the variation between
Asian area nibs versus those from the European region. This pen is my first
foray into demonstration style pens, and with the Pilot CON-50 converter, it
performs quite admirably. "
pennydox,"January 7, 2015","It's a pleasantly thin line with little railroading so far. The grip is very
nice to handle. The pen is very hard at the tip, so don't press too hard or you
might poke a hole through your paper. "
kaijahmonson,"January 1, 2015","I love this pen, though the ink bleeds. I'll probably have to fill it with ink
as recommended. "
gwmasse,"January 1, 2015","I love this pen too. I love ordering these lower priced fountain pens that I
have never seen in stores and trying them out. Ya I know, need to get a life. 
Jet pens is one of my favorite online stores. Great products, reasonable prices,
great service. "
candence,"December 30, 2014",lost my first one but am happy again.  I really like this pen

nancynz528,"December 14, 2014","OMG this is such a great pen. It is thin and writes smoothly immediately for me.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH and I will definitely be buying more of these when I have more
money. BUY IT. You will not regret it!"
theshirleywong,"November 24, 2014","I surprisingly love this pen. It's writes smoothly and the flow of ink is
consistent. My only issue is that the ink slightly leaks near the nib, so make
sure you always have the cap on when not in use. "
hannibalwilldo,"November 20, 2014","My ultimate favourite. This pen ruined other pens for me. I'm very specific with
my writing implements, and this one took the cake. The size is adequate, the
grip is mighty comfortable, it has a cap, and it's clear -- makes it easier to
know if you still have ink and what colour said ink is. Only downside? I use it
too much and run out of ink like House runs out of vicodin. And we all know how
Gregory House is without his vicodin."
mark212,"November 19, 2014","excellent pen. I have two of these. It's a pretty thin line, definitely for the
super-precise folks (I am one). Great feel in the hand, awesome ink flow,
consistent no-skip line -- can't say enough good things about this. I have two
and they both just write and write and write. I've use one with the converter
and Sailor ink and honestly the cartridges seem to work better with less fussing
around.I just wish Pilot would take this nib and put it into a more ""classy""
professional body, maybe one with a bit more heft / weight."
liralenli,"November 7, 2014","Super fine, super good writer. Wonderful for drawing extremely fine lines in
highly detailed work."
blackcat4656,"November 6, 2014",great for drawing but it does take a while to get used to

drawing."
becsflowers,"October 27, 2014",best fountain pen in the West
nonchalance_is_dead,"October 17, 2014","This is ridiculous, I own several very expensive fountain pens, and this cheap
pilot penmanship out performs them all. The line it throws down is always
consistent, and I never have any trouble starting up, even if I haven't used it
in a couple of days. I did have a bit of a problem in the beginning, the nib was
dripping globs of ink like nobodies business, but a little fiddling with the nib
and voila! A perfectly perfect fountain pen. I absolutely love my pilot
penmanship, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great fountain
pen for an awesome price."
zamora.luis26,"August 24, 2014","Finally gave this a try, had it sitting around for a couple months. On my first
write, it took a while for the ink to run through completely, a problem I didn't
have with my Preppy and Plumix, those two flowed right away. That's not a big
deal, it works and that's all that matters. It writes well, no skipping, nice
spidery lines and saves a lot of ink. It is however, a bit scratchy. For the
whole time i used it, it scratched, which is annoying but it never skipped or
anything. Overall, it's a nice little pen but should be a couple bucks cheaper. I
recommend it though, good little lines come out of this."
Empressionzoo,"July 25, 2014","Amazing fountain pen! Great value too. The clear body allows me to see clearly
how much ink I have left and when I use colored ink, it lets me show it off a
bit more ;)  For some users it might be scratchy because the nib is so pointy, but since I
use it when I write Chinese characters and other journal entries, the precise
nib is perfect. "
kiyo287,"April 2, 2014","This pen is awesome! As expected, pilot's quality is superb. I have yet to
purchase one of their pens and be disappointed. The nib never clogs. You don't
have to worry about evaporating ink or ink spillage, due to the screw on cap.
The extra fine tip is exactly as described. It is very fine! I love using this
pen for detailing and fine work. "
klin14263,"November 23, 2013","the pen itself was of good quality, however the nib seemed too thin for my
personal preference. this pen is good if you want to write small and squeeze in letters or if you
want to draw in details in a drawing."
connierose,"August 31, 2013","The Pilot Penmanship writes a scratchy line.  I don't like it nearly as much as
the Pilot Preppy pens.  I've tried several types of paper but the Penmanship
writes too scratchy on all of them."
Victory Pens,"August 24, 2013","This pen is basically the pilot plumix but with an extra fine nib instead of a
medium one. The ergonomic grip is pleasant and smooth. My only complaint is that
the nib is so fine that it is a bit scratchy when writing on paper. "
aco_narciso,"July 29, 2013","I use this everyday for taking notes (an everyday pen if you will) with nary a
hiccup. I like that it has a clear body, so I can monitor the ink levels. I
actually find myself writing more beautifully when I am using a fountain pen,
than when I am using the good ol bic blue. I have to make a makeshift stand for
this though, as it rolls off when it is capless."
deadly-claris,"May 24, 2013","Absolutely amazing pen! I was a little skeptical at first, considering the cheap
price of it compared to many other pricier models, but after reading many
positive reviews, I decided to take the plunge, and was not disappointed! It
writes superbly and the ink flows smoothly. I wrote an entire page with
absolutely no ink skipping so far. Some have commented that it's scratchy at
first and needs some time to 'break in', but I felt that it was only slight
scratchy and it wasn't much of a problem for me. The design of it is also very
nice, the clear barrel looks delicate yet sturdy. The cap is also a nice touch,
and it being a screw-on ensures that it won't fall off by accident leaving the
nib to be damaged. I'm pleased that I got this pen, as it's going to be my
everyday-pen from here on, and I'll definitely be investing in a few more for
'back up', along with ink cartridges."
sugarmapletree,"May 6, 2013","I really love this pen! It writes very fine, but I had no problems with
scratchiness for either of the instances I bought. I have not tried the ink that
came with the pen though."
maxhongmingli,"April 15, 2013","I've had this for a few months now.  It writes pretty well, not that scratchy
(though some scratch is to be expected for such a fine tip).  It writes like my
ballpoints and other pens.  This was my first introduction to fountain pens, and
I think it does pretty well.  You get used to the grip, and I find that it is
helpful.  I had one leak in my pocket once, but I think that was my fault. 
Occasionally ink gathers in the cap, but that doesn't really happen too much
after I stopped carrying it and kept it tip up."
Krichar410,"March 13, 2013","I just got my pens in today......Love them....especially the clear one with the
extra fine nib.  I have a feeling I have found another favorite pen.Thanks for the fast shipping.  Sometimes it is just nice to sign a card for
someone with a real nice pen."
memarcho,"February 25, 2013","I always keep my doubts on cheapper pens for a journal or daily use.
Affortunatelly, I was wrong with this pen. Lighter, comfortable on hand, smooth
on any paper, great ink flowing and very thin lines on the writing. His
qualities makes this pen in a special category. Pilot brand always keeps people
in mind. They do not sacrifice quality for price. And that is great."
distractedpants,"January 2, 2013","A great recent purchase from JetPens. The pen feels nice in the hand and the
grip is indeed very comfortable. The line is lovely and thin. To echo other
reviewers I do think it needs a slight breaking-in period. Initially it wrote
with a slight bite but after using it on and off for a few days is became very
smooth. Personally, I like the cap design and it's size but it's not for
everyone. I'm going to use this pen mainly in my work 2013 diary which has cheap
paper but I've experienced no bleeding or feathering. I purchased a CON-50 to go
along with this pen but I'm considering just converting to eyedropper.
Definitely reccommended."
dkorenko,"December 26, 2012","I just got a couple of the pilot penmanship pens.  I purchased them based on
other reviews.  They are an excellent pen, however it depends on your use.  I
purchased these pens for highlighting and notes for Bible study.  Bible paper is
very thin and requires a very fine ink line without a lot of ink.  These pens do
put down more ink than the Bible paper can handle and the ink does bleed
through.  I found that the very fine Lamy Safari pen used with Pelikan ink works
much better for my purposes.  All this aside, the Pilot pens are an excellent
pen and I will find other uses for them.  I'm not sorry I got them, I was just
disappointed that they didn't work out for my intended purpose."
John_M_Hand,"November 28, 2012","This pen is really, really fun to use. It's my first fountain pen and the only
fault it has is it isn't one of my smoother pens. That said they are supposed to
wear in so it might be temporary."

I can't even use it because the ink has clogged or the tip is bad."
chaseg,"June 2, 2011","I was a little disappointed. It feels a little cheap and the Nib is extremely
scratchy. It writes OK on cheap-o printer paper, but forget about it in a
journal or notebook. I'm going to convert it to an eye-dropper and use some
Noodler's ink from the Eel line. I'm hoping this will help. For the price, I'd
say buy 3 or 4 Preppys or Ink Bars. I'm switching back to the trusty Safari
until I convert. "
stephanie72978,"March 27, 2010","Just got it today and not at all impressed. I bought this pen, the preppy and

a try..."
s.seungjoo.lee,"March 19, 2010","I have a broad range of pens from extremely inexpensive to high end...this pen
writes terribly, is an exploding mess and writes worst then the disposable pens

bad, bad."
dhananjayvk,"December 5, 2009","One of the ... Sorry, The best pen out there. ( Agree, Carbon, & Sailor are
comparable.)Try to refill Pilot petit after removing cartridge and ink into barrel... the
genius pilot design is made SO THAT air compression and decompression of Petit
WILL expell ink out... so that we'll have to BUY more cartridges. (Refill the
cartridge itself!!) The screw on Penmanship eliminates this pressure jump
problem... After the cartridge is over... You can use the whole reservoir
without CARTRIDGE. Writes amazing. NO LEAK. If by mistake yours leaks, use
shrink-wrap plastic as sealant. Enjoy 50 pages of refill free writing.All you Pen-O-philes... get a Maltesear cobalt nail-file and file the tips (not
too much) to the perfect precisions and smoothness!!!God Day Good Luck...!!"
Doug,"December 3, 2009","California to Virginia 3-7 day standard shipping arrived in 4 days, did not
expect it to be so prompt, very pleased. Had a great time admiring the nib
compared to the Plumix, extra fine is amazing in looks and writing. I've had the
Plumix for about 2 weeks and am almost out of ink, penmanship shouldn't run dry
as quickly but it'll last long enough for spare cartridges to be needed. It
looks like these cartridges could be refilled fairly easily, but I don't have
any experience there. If you think you want it, get it. You'll be glad."
Mary Thornhill,"November 29, 2009","I got this pen recently when I ordered some Noodler's Ink. I thought I'd give
one of these a try since it was so reasonably priced for a fountain pen I could
experiment with.  I have to say that I am totally amazed by it's quality, both the body of the pen
and the extra-fine nib. I have never seen a nib that writes so fine a line. Now
I can't wait until I empty this cartridge that came with the pen so that I can
put some of the Noodler's Ink I bought in to try those colors out. Thanks for offering such an excellent pen!"
DaniSpaz1,"August 27, 2009","I have been checking out JetPens for a while, but never ordered anything until
this week. The delivery was quick, especially since I’m on the other side of
the country. This pen writes really nice. I love fine points but wow! It is
super, extra fine! The pen is really lightweight and I like the grip. It’s
very comfortable. I can’t wait to find more things to write so I can use my
pen. I bought a converter to use with my bottle inks. I haven’t used it yet,
but I can’t wait. The only thing I’m going to have to get used to is a screw

fountain pen a lot, and I have tons of fountain pens!"
roundedpi,"June 30, 2009","This is the first fountain pen that I could stick in my pony tail. It writes

a fiber caught in between the tines of the nib once, but after I pulled it out,
nothing similar happened again. "
kimkeel,"September 6, 2022",Excellent for fine details. Great ink flow.
Leornera,"August 18, 2022","I have already reviewed this pen and would like to add something.  I think I
mentioned earlier that I flipped the nib so that the extra fine nib from this
pen now sits in my Pilot Metropolitan, and the fine nib from the Pilot
Metropolitan now sits in the Pilot Penmanship.  Both nibs write beautifully.I have also converted the Pilot Penmanship pen into an eye dropper pen, and it
works very well in that capacity.  "
tladner,"June 8, 2022",Nice writing pen with Extra Fine nib.
shrimpknuckles,"May 25, 2022","Comfortable like Kakuno, and it keeps my fingers away from the tip/point.  My

Leornera,"May 20, 2022","I had two Pilot Metropolitan pens with fine nibs, and I swapped the extra fine
nib in the Pilot Penmanship with one of the fine nibs in a Pilot Metropolitan. 
I now own a Pilot Metropolitan with an extra fine nib, and it writes extremely
well.  Regarding the Pilot Penmanship, now with fine nib, I have installed one
of the black rubber converters that come with the Pilot Metropolitans (which I
use with clear converters), and it makes a nice extra pen.  I am thinking of
purchasing a more Penmanship pens and using them with different colored ink
cartridges.  That should be fun!  "
c roo,"May 11, 2022","easy and beautiful writing, right amount of friction - writing is 5 starshowever, the pen cap and body, both which are spiral/screw on type, squeaks a

croutonThehamster,"April 10, 2022","My pen-holding posture's pretty bad! I never learned the right way so here I am
trying to relearn it.  The Pilot penmanship makes it easier and is comfortable
to hold. It's an EF nib though so I don't put my favorite shading inks in this
as the lines are microscopic! It's tiny enough for writing in my A6 planner and
journal and encourages me to be neat and consistent while my fingers relearn how
to grip. I'd definitely recommend getting it! "
c.h.luke,"March 29, 2022",Well made and writes well!
rankkaapina,"March 23, 2022","Nice EF Pilot that doesn't cost much. I was actually going to switch these nibs
to my Metropolitans, but I've changed my mind and I quite like the Pilot F nib
for longer writing. These are not the prettiest of pens, but the nibs are
excellent considering the price of the pen. I did buy 2, so I added some
stickers so I can tell them apart. This is my only issue with Pilot: they need
more options for body colors in every pen style!"
MrTomRN,"March 21, 2022","Cute yet solid well made pen. The nib is a bit stiff but the lines are crisp and
fine. The pen is east to use and clean. I would buy this again!"
J B ,"February 11, 2022","I really love this pen as it is my first Japanese extra fine. The build of the
pen feels cheap, but it writes incredibly. Fortunately, I already had a con-40
converter from another pen that I could slap on it pretty fast.The tactile feel of this pen might confuse some people as ""scratchiness"", but I
would consider it more ""sharp"" if that makes more sense? It doesn't scratch into
the paper, but it has feedback because the tip is SO fine that you can hear and
feel it more. If you've never wrote with a Japanese extra fine, you'll need to
get used to that feeling.Some mention drying out with this pen, but I haven't had any trouble so far.
Though, I use my pens frequently and only ink up 3-5 at a time so that I can
give them all love within a week.Something that did bother me, though... The pen spurted out ink when dropped, it
got on the lid, and it proceeded to get on the threading. That made the pen a
mess, my fingers a mess, and I couldn't get it out of the threading very easily.
Once I clean it out, I'll be giving it a good wash down.Otherwise, a solid entry into Pilot's pens. It looks like a Pilot Plumix, but
not quite. Try it out while they're still in stock! They're discontinued, I
believe."
HollieD,"January 25, 2022",I bought this mostly for the EF nib. It's great for the price.

foxdenfarms7,"November 6, 2021","Would give it a five stars but the pen is so light that it really amplifies the
scratchy feel of the very sharp nib. I like it and own two but I have to many

hands down. "
stygar.audrey,"November 4, 2021",Writes smoothly and the line thickness is wonderful!
newphone221,"October 11, 2021","It writes a little scratchy on some types of paper. I keep it in a roll up case
with my other pens and I noticed that it had started to leak a little but the
other pens hadn't. Other than that I think its a good pen as long as I use it
with better quality paper."
Rotsterne,"October 11, 2021","These pens are great, even though they require a bit of a break-in period. I am
new to fountain pens, and this is the 2nd brand I've tried (my first fountain
pen was a Platinum Preppy, and wow, did it spoil me!). I was put off at first by
how finnicky they are to start off with, but I've come to understand that these
fountain pens are NOT at all like other pens. They don't like all inks. They
don't like almost any pressure. If you press too hard, they are really scratchy,
but if you let the nib just glide over the paper, it will lay down ink, and in
the finest line I've found so far. Depending on the ink and paper, it can vary
from around .3mm to around .5mm in width. I have bought three of these (one
black, two clear), and I have been frustrated with each one for about a week
until I figured out how to get it to write the way I want. Or at all. There
definitely seems to be a learning curve involved. But once I worked out all its
quirks, I really enjoyed these pens a lot! TL;DR Don't expect it to write smoothly right away like a Platinum Preppy does.
Experimentation is necessary. It might well frustrate you, but if you give it
time, you will eventually have an great pen."
louiilyle,"July 26, 2021",Nice one.

uhhsoomen,"June 7, 2021","Fun pen to use and more comfortable than I anticipated. Some how the triangle
shaped grip section helps me relax my grip. When paired with the write ink you
can write on average printer paper with minimal feathering. I have not used the
ink cartridge it came with so I can't comment on that, using it as a backup."
kedbyrd,"May 28, 2021",Great pen for the price!
CleveDawgPound,"May 22, 2021","I have several fountain pens but I had been using an extra fine Platinum Preppy
for quite a while as a daily driver.  Mostly for note taking.  I've had several
and I really enjoy the way they write.  I have never had an issue with one.  Add
ink and it writes well right from the beginning.  The only issue was that I
wanted a reasonably priced but nicer more durable pen.  I use the clip and had
broken multiple on the Preppy. Plus I wanted something a little nicer looking. 
I got a Pilot Metropolitan and it was exactly what I was looking for as far as
price.  Only issue was I wanted extra fine and they don't come in extra fine. 
The fine was ok but it was a bit wet for my liking. I used it for a while and
recently decided to get the Penmanship and swap the nib.  Oh man, it's terrible.
 The line width seems good, but it is horribly scratchy.  I am still working on
tuning it up, but I never had to tune a Preppy.  At this point I am ready to
call it a waste of time and money and continue my search, but we will see if it
improves over time.  "

like being able to see exactly how much ink is left."

mbonneau,"December 13, 2020","It's a Pilot pen and I've paired my with Pilot refills so the value for money as
well as the ink is excellent, but I think I prefer the feel of the Metropolitan
Fine point to the Penmanship EF. I originally bought this for transplanting the
nib into my Metro, but the Fine is definitely a better all-around choice for me.
So I left the Penmanship alone and used it as-is for a while, and just don't
love the feel in-hand. My Lamy Safari does the pronounced triangle grip much
better, and the triangle grip on my TWSBI Eco-T makes the pen feel smaller than
it is, but on the Penmanship it just feels a little clumsy and imprecise. "
Gabor,"December 3, 2020","An excellent nib.I was searching for a very fine fountain pen nib for a very long time, and it is
perfect.It's thickness is comparable to the Uni-ball Signo 0.38 mm gel pen. It can even
be difficult to differentiate between the two, however this is less consistent,
as expected from a fountain pen.I'm not fan of the pen's body personally, it also feels a little bit cheap. I'm
using this nib with Pilot Prera Brown's body."
jrfwalker,"November 4, 2020","Unbelievably fine little fountain pen. It has a very small fine point and the
ink flow is perfect. Better than pens that cost hundreds of dollars."
lynntx12,"October 29, 2020","Super fine line, but scratchy, a struggle to load, break-in, and use. You get

bhoy3,"October 28, 2020",Too hard to start ink flow.  Not thrilled with this purchase. 
Ickabod,"October 23, 2020","Awesome pen! The nib is more of an EEF, which is great! The ink it comes with is nice and black. Not waterproof though, and the ink
stands pronounced on top of the paper, so it's easy to activate on a humid day
when your hand goes back over it.Easy to refill with your own ink when it's dry."
jcastle07,"October 16, 2020","I purchased this pen for the nib. I switched it out with the <F> nib in my Pilot

Brown. It wasn't scratchy and moved well over the medium-weight paper I was
using."

patty43123,"October 7, 2020","If you want a very fine line from a fountain pen, buy this pen! It's a Pilot so
the nib is consistent and reliable. There's a fair amount of feedback from this
EF nib but I was expecting that. The threads on the screw-on cap don't always
line up on first attempt but that hasn't been a major problem. The grip section
is shaped somewhat like a Lamy to help you hold it correctly. The overall pen
shape is similar to the Pilot Plumix. "

super fine point. Overall, it’s a great product! "
melbasmile,"September 6, 2020","While this pen looks really cool, when it comes to actually writing I have
trouble with it. If I am taking notes and there are a few seconds where I’m
not writing but I keep the cap off, when I start writing again (under a minute
later!) the ink will not flow. I don’t know if it’s drying up or what the
problem is but it’s frustrating. The extra fine tip is nice when it’s
working, but since the ink flow seems rather finicky, more often it’s just
scratching the paper than leaving ink marks. I don’t have a ton of experience
with fountain pens so user error is a possibility, but considering I cannot find
what I am doing wrong, I would not recommend this pen."
greenade3,"September 2, 2020","This is very smooth and the shape if ergonomic and comfortable for gripping the
pen. The clear casing makes it look sleek and clean. Replacing cartridges is
super easy. I suggest buying extra ink with the purchase of this because I used
it up pretty fast. I used it to take nots without any skips or bumps!"
Diamine Velvet,"August 31, 2020","    Finally! I have always wanted to love writing with a fountain pen since I
was a child, but I never could find anything that suited my small handwriting
needs. I have had Monte Blanc, Lamy, Pilot, etc. medium, fine, extra-fine, you
name it. Nothing ever really came to close to my favorite G2 0.38 Pilot pens
that I love so much for doing all of my Math work (these are the best
non-fountain pens known to mankind IMHO!). I am super happy with the feel of my
Pilot Metropolitan pens, but they just don't write fine enough for me. I tried
all different inks to refine the size but I just tend to write to much on poor
quality printer paper for it to really work well. I watched a video about a nib
swap between this and the Pilot Metropolitan and thought I would try it
myself...WOW!...    Not only is this nib amazing for small writers but the pen itself fits like
a glove and is super comfortable and fun to write with! My only complaint is the
pen is super lightweight. If this pen were manufactured with a metal
body...Pilot could call it quits as they would have made one of the best
fountain pens out there. I purchased 3 more of these pens just to have then nibs
for Pilot Metropolitan swaps! Now I am going to try to get my 9 year old hooked
on fountain pens with these!"
dowpatterson,"August 26, 2020","This pen is really fun if you like detail. The EX Fine point requires a little
more attention and more break-in...but gets better as break in occurs. “Keep
it clean and nib down”! helps. Like 00 Rapidograph fine almost. Very
affordable. I’m glad it’s in my tool kit. "
jlc7,"August 19, 2020","Writes beautifully straight out of the box. It's the most enjoyable writing

have a tendency to look somewhat ""cheap.""  But I love writing with the
extra-fine nib.  I have small handwriting, and this lets my letters look like
what they are supposed to look like, as far as letter form, instead of just
large blobs on a squiggly line, like many wider nibs tend to do.  Excellent pen
for practicing letter forms, if you write small, to improve your cursive hand. "

couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  I am considering inserting  the nib and
feed into a Prera body, because I really like Preras, but the body of the pen is
OK.  I am left handed and was concerned about the triangle grip section, but it
works well for me."

the extra fine nibs. They are a bit scrathy but I do not mind. They are also not
very wet with the ink and therefore do not bleed through on my journal pages."
mwilson,"May 18, 2019","Great construction, but the nib is quite sharp and scratchy - bear in mind
though that it is an extra-fine. The grip section is very comfortable. The pen
writes a very well-defined line, and does what it advertises to do. Makes a good
sketch pen, and i'm sure in the wider nib widths would be a great handwriting
tool."
fsgay,"April 30, 2019","I find this to be a truly enjoyable daily use pen. Its lightweight, comfortable
to hold, and the linewidth is exactly what i'm looking for from an Extra Fine
nib (its comparable to a 0.4mm gel pin line). The nib did take a few days of
breaking in, but the feedback once broken in is just about perfect. True to the
intent of this pen though, you can't write too quickly/aggressively on cheap
papers, as i've seen a tendency for the nib to grab fibers occasionally. I have
to be only slightly deliberate to avoid this on Moleskine paper, and on
Leutchtturm and esspecially Rhodia, I don't have to worry about it. I do switch
to a Fine nib (in my Kakuno or Metropolitan depending on what they're inked up
with) when needing to take very rapid notes on a legal pad during meetings
however.One potential additional benefit that I haven't yet gotten to fully try is the
fact that the clear body and threaded cap should, in theory, allow worry-free
carry on an airplane, in the sense that if the pen does leak, it will be
contained *and* you'll be able to see the leak before uncapping the pen, and
take appropriate precautions."

Trine Sorensen,"July 30, 2018","I think I might have gotten a defect nib, but it could be all EF Extra Fine nibs
are like this? Bought only for the nib, as a replacement for a Pilot
Metropolitan F nib that had a hard meeting with a floor and got bent. This nib
has been nothing but a hassle for months and months. I've really tried, I have.
I think the tines are misaligned, I've tried some simple ways of trying to
realign nibs for home users. Ways that shouldnt destroy it more than it already
was, at least, but nothing works. It makes tiny clicking noises from time to
time, and I suspect it's the tines being rubbed against each other. It seem like
the clicking sounds are when the tines pop one over the other, from being bent
or pressed too much together. Perhaps. It looks like only one tine has a tipping
material on it, too. I've read that these finer points can be scratchy, but this
literally cuts paper. And gathers fibers like it's a bird making a nest. I've
really tried to like this, given it pages an pages of lines and writing to try
to smooth it out a bit. It's just awful. "
Marz,"April 4, 2018","At first, I thought I was going to like this pen, boy was I wrong! The ink tends
to leak for those that are always on the go and your backpack jostles a lot. So
if you are on the move, I wouldn't suggest this pen unless you have a really
reliable pen case that keeps everything from moving. Next, the tip is incredibly
scratchy. I like fine tip pens but you do have to keep your wits about you about
this pen or you'll end up scratching your pen. I gave it away to a friend who
seems to enjoy it. It could just be my heavy hand but this pen did not work for
my constant writing nature. "

nclemieux2,"November 29, 2017","I previously purchased two of these pens and due to my own fault dropped both on
different occasions and destroyed one nib and the other is bent but still
writes.... so do Be CAREFUL! That said, I just love the extra  fine tip....I really like Spencerian and this
helps me with my lessons when doing the drills! I can go across the page and not
have to stop to ink up. Eventually my Oblique pen holder and nib will get a turn
but until I am really proficient this is my go to pen! I  bought a con-50
converter so I can use my bottles Inks and the clear pen lets me know if I need
a refill of ink or not, without disassembling the pen to check. When I
eventually start sketching with this pen, that feature will surely be a
priority... I also bought the black one, haven't used it yet but may need it as
a back-up if I drop this one. I just need to be more conscious of putting the
cap on and not letting it roll off the table or wherever. Not that it rolls
around, because it is designed to stay put when the cap is posted. It is my
favorite writing Instrument and I never want to be without one or two!! :)"
bo.ryan,"November 3, 2017","I'm not crazy about this pen. It's extremely fine, but doesn't lay down the best
line. I'll stick to a Sakura pigma or Faber Castel fineliner in the future when
I need a line that thin. The plastic nibs on those even have more flex than this
pen if you care for that.  The pen feels like an inexpensive pen, and the sections screw apart with that
kind of nails on a chalkboard feeling of cheap plastic. I fixed that with a
little silicon grease.  But hey, it's inexpensive, right? You won't find a nib this small at that price
anywhere else. Except the platinum preppy..."
ewu,"October 24, 2017","Five stars for the nib--smooth and super fine with no skips or blots.  The pen
body is cheap, clear, plastic, lightweight, and holds a really nice nib.  What
were you hoping for?"
badasstatguy,"October 18, 2017","This is probably my favorite of all the pens that I own so far.  I love the ergo
grip, it looks amazing as an eyedropper pen with a pretty ink in it, such as
Noodler's Cape Cod pink.  It's just a fun pen to write with, although it is a
little ""scratchy"", but I guess that is to be expected with an extra fine nib.  I
am finding that I do like a little feedback when I write,..with pens that glide
too smoothly over the paper I tend to go a little faster and make more mistakes.
 I highly recommend this pen for beginners.  I am not sure I would recommend it
for students to use at school because of it's size.  I love it as an eyedropper
and have not had any leaks even without an o-ring (just silicone grease) as it
holds a lot of ink in it's long barrell.  I highly recommend this pen, and
Jetpens as a retailer,..always fast and accurate shipments. "
nclemieux2,"September 13, 2017","I really like the fine lines I can get with this pen...I am using it to learn
Spencerian and it is great for my lessons. Also it would be great as a drawing
pen. I like the fact I can see Ink levels at a glance!"
ahtzib,"September 6, 2017","The Penmanship is probably the most underrated fountain pen out there... It features a desk-pen inspired design in a clear acrylic (with a very cool
purplish hue). While similar to the Pliot Plumix in shape, the Penmanship is bit
narrower with a slightly more streamlined squid-like design. Also like the
Plumix, the Penmanship's small cap posts securely despite its size. The
Penmanship makes an amazing eyedropper, which shows off its vast capacity with
style. (Brighter links like kon-peki and yu-yake are displayed to great effect!)But the truly standout feature is the EF nib...which is *really* EF. Pilot's
steel ""Super Quality"" nibs generally run on the fine side, and this EF is no
exception. (I would guesstimate that it clocks in around 0.1, taking it into
what would be custom territory for almost any other pen nib.) Even if you're
just after the amazing nib, this pen is a deal and another example from Pilot
that high quality can be delivered at exceptional value."

that it can be converted into an eyedropper. "
SW Hannan,"May 21, 2017","I love the way this pen writes, and the slightly ergonomic grip is as unique as
it is pleasant. However, I hate the screw on/off cap. It's sticky and tedious.
This is a lovely pen, otherwise. P.S. I was told the nibs on these pens care interchangeable with the nibs on the
Pilot Metropolitan pens. That's great, if so, because the Metropolitans don't
come in extra-fine nibs. Regrettably, though the Metropolitan pens have a lovely
capt, they don't have an ergonomic grip. If only one Pilot pen had this grip
with a better cap, I'd be perfectly happy. "
Christine Evans,"April 29, 2017","I loved this pen, but after some use the ink will not flow.  I have cleaned it
with pen cleaner, did not work."
evalemons,"April 25, 2017",Nice fountain Pen. 
sch4321,"April 18, 2017","I really enjoy this pen. The nib is a little scratchy, but I like it like that;
it feels like writing with a very sharp pencil.Line width is comparable to the Uniball Signo 0.38. Black ink is a bit grayer
than the Signo.Tip for lefties: you can rotate the nib to get the grip at a more comfortable
angle. Just grab the nib and feed jiggle it to rotate."
Simone,"April 6, 2017","When I first received this pen, I was so excited to use it. But when I unscrewed
the barrel, two pieces of plastic rattled around and came out. The mechanism
that pierces the cartridge had broken off somehow during shipping. I contacted
Jetpens about this, and they were incredibly quick in replying to me and almost
immediately sent out a new pen when I explained what had happened. Incredible
customer service. I got the pen today and all is well, and I love it. Ink flow
is super smooth, and nib is very fine but not so fine that it is scratchy. I
love this pen. Ergonomic grip feels really nice to hold and I love the clear
barrel so you can see all the mechanisms. Affordable and perfect for anyone-
beginner, or otherwise. "
feehly,"April 6, 2017","I LOVE this pen. I did not expect to. I thought it would be cheap and flimsy and
scratchy. I had a poor experience at first with my Pilot Metropolitan but it
improved just enough with use that I considered another Pilot. I have so-so
penmanship and thought this pen would be a great tool to help me improve. And it
is! The grip and the elongated barrel work to allow me to hold the pen properly
without much effort, so I have one less distraction as I write. The extra-fine
nib writes impossibly small so I have to be careful in how I form my letters in
a way that I would not if I used a medium nib.This helps me see exactly how
poor/good my execution of each letter really is. The ink cartridge has lasted a
while and the ink is a dark black that is perfect for writing. The dry time is
good, the experience of this pen is remarkable for its price. The nib can be
scratchy but I feel this is outweighed by the other benefits listed above. If
using good paper with it, the scratchy aspect is much reduced."
king7two8010,"March 21, 2017",It's very good and very comfortable pen and soft.
Matt,"March 16, 2017","I bought 2 of these pens. One just for the nib so I could replace the nib on my
Pilot Metropolitan which I bent when it slipped out of my hand and onto the
floor. The nib from the Penmanship works great with the Metropolitan. The Penmanship is a bit scratchier and there's more feedback compared to the
Metropolitan. That's due to the fact that the Penmanship is made of plastic and
the Metropolitan is metal. I like the feel of the Metropolitan more. I don't know if the Namiki Red Ink that I'm using in the Penmanship dries faster
or if it has something to do with the pen itself. I had the Penmanship sitting
for about a week and it took awhile for the ink to flow. I'm not using the red
ink in the Metropolitan so I don't know if it's the ink or not.The Penmanship is a good starter pen but I like the Metropolitan more."

Everything is good.  Fast delivery "
pgcauk,"March 8, 2017","I bought this for the nib, which is interchangeable with the Metropolitan, and
also a ""Plumix"" with an italic nib likewise. I ended up using them all! Not
really a pocket pen but great value, and having a choice of four nibs for the
Metropolitan is better than two!Oh, and the extra-fine is really very fine indeed!"
ezoetaylor,"March 3, 2017","I love this pen! It's a nice very fine point pen at a very very nice price

tricicla,"November 6, 2016","This is a very good pen, in my opinion. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's
Japanese fine, that is, VERY fine. I like extra fine nibs but this is far beyond
fine. I like it, but you might not. However, if you are always bothered by extra
fine nibs that are not extra fine, then try this out. It's also very inexpensive
and you can use universal cartridges with it!!!"

doesn't cramp and/or fall clean off, you can fit abooouuut 300 words on a little
teeny tiny sheet of Rodia graph.  If you ever find yourself that bored, or short
of paper on hand."
fiberdrunk,"August 15, 2016","Excellent smooth-writing nib, even for an EF nib.  I like to use this to write
Gregg shorthand, or anything that requires a fine line.  Pilot makes the best
pens, and this is so cool to look at, too.  Very unique.  I recommend getting
the Pilot CON-50 ink converter to go with it."
1976,"August 9, 2016","This pen has been amazing for my ink drawings, the extra fine nib is perfect for
detail and hatching. Not a big fan of the screw on cap design, i would prefer a
snap on cap. At least the cap has a couple of pegs that hold the pen in place
when you set it down on your desk, that way it doesn't roll over. Other than
that I think this is a fantastic pen for its price."
ryan.grattan,"June 28, 2016","Great pen, very light weight, very smooth writing.  Ergo Grip is also a very
nice touch.  I ended up taking the EF nib that came on this pen and putting it
on a Metropolitan, which is now my go-to penThe screw cap is very secure, unfortunately I needed something that was easier
to remove as I'm running around a lot all day and jotting notes in very random
places.  Still use this pen when I'll be at a desk for an extended period of
time and probably for drawing as well."
jrohland616,"May 31, 2016","Good value pen, especially for the price. Performs fine. The lack of a clip
makes it easy to lose, however, and mostly smooth body allows it to roll and
slide around perilously. Given its designation as a 'Penmanship' pen, it seems
not unreasonable to assume it's intended to be an inexpensive starter/trainer
pen. If you like extra fine nibs, you might like this. For myself, I discovered
extra was a little too fine for me."
Jonathan,"May 30, 2016","This pen is one of the best fountain pen I've had a chance to use. The lines are
smooth, super fine, and never skips. The screw-on cap prevents the nib from
drying and the screw-on body can be filled with ink if you don't fancy the
cartridge. Great for both drawing and writing."
neeman,"May 22, 2016","This is hit or missI have one out the box was roughish but after using the 0.3 paper to smooth the

Eric,"April 14, 2016","Brilliant cheap pen. Would be four stars except there's no space between the end
of the nib and the where the cap screws on, so when filling a converter the
thread inevitably receives ink and obviously the thread is more difficult to
wipe ink from than a sheer surface would be such as on the (more expensive)
Metro."
beautifuldei,"April 13, 2016","I had no idea that I could obtain such clear legibility in extremely tiny spaces
on the small pages I use in my day planner!  Before this pen, there were so many
frustrating time wasting re-writes due to the relatively blunt tips of
disposable pens.  To heck with them.  I am extremely pleased with this pen.  I
had been worried about a fountain pen leaking but I confirm there are no leaks
with this pen.  "
maggie.harrison,"March 16, 2016","Phenomenal pen -- very smooth writing, and I *love* the delicate extra-fine

Hovera,"March 16, 2016","I am very satisfied with the grip, which is really comfortable and non-tiring

kdoblinger,"March 3, 2014","This is an absolutely amazing pen. By FAR the thinnest line of any of my pens -
exquisite! Good ink flow (I am using Noodlers Black Eel and now Diamine Burnt
Sienna). Super nice pen. Some people don't seem to care for the very small screw type cap, and maybe I am
just used to this setup by now (which is the same in the Plumix), but I think it
adds to the distinctiveness of this pen.  However, I also have several Pilot Metropolitan pens, and as you may know, they
are ONLY available with a medium nib. But the Metropolitan, the Penmanship and
the Plumix share the same size nibs, so I turned my Penmanship into a donor pen
for my Metropolitan (and of course, planted the M nib from the Metro on the
Penmanship). Awesome product. "

mbright,"August 31, 2016","This is my first TWSBI and this has replaced my Pilot Metropolitan as my
most-used pen. This is a great value for a demonstrator fountain pen with a real
piston filler mechanism. I think demonstrator pens with converters look
underwhelming so this fit the bill. I find the EF nib to just about split the
difference between Pilots Fine nib and their Extra Fine nib, depending on ink
and paper. Mine definitely feels ""wetter"" than the Metro. Overall I'm very
pleased.Pros:Very smooth nib with a slightly springy feel (great for fast, small handwriting)Feels solidly built (cap screws on securely, clip feels sturdy, and the filler
mechanism on the back doesn't have any play and requires enough force that I'm
not worried about leaks)Design is top notch for the price, especially with the clear capOne-piece barrel and section is very comfortable to holdHolds a lot of inkDurability issues with earlier models have supposedly been fixedCons:Puts down a fairly wet line (not an issue for me, but could conflict with some
ink and paper choices)Cap doesn't post well"

smooth; more so than I expected for an EF nib. And of course, it holds a LOT of

kuilanb4,"March 2, 2018","For the first couple of weeks this pen wrote wonderfully, nothing could go
wrong. Unfortunately, I don't quite know what happened but now it's leaking. I'd
already gone through a couple of refills with no leakage and I make sure to
absorb the excess as instructed. I also disassembled it, cleaned everything out
with soap and water, let it dry, and then reassembled it before refilling it
again to no avail. It only starts leaking when I tilt the pen about 50 degrees
downward, so I can't write with it anymore unless I empty it out till it's just
in the feed. If anyone could please help me figure this out, I would greatly
appreciate it. I have only filled the pen with Noodler's legal blue ink and it
worked just fine until a couple of days ago. I will leave this review at 3 stars
for now as I loved using the pen but it's inoperable at the moment."
Inky Paws,"June 15, 2018","I already had an ECO-Fine nib, and wanted to try out the XF nib. I like it. At
first, I really didn't, because its not that much finer than the Fine, and was a
little harder to start at first, but its broken in nicely. I wish it was a
little finer personally. Notably, others have called this scratchy--I haven't
found it to be so at all (maybe a little more at first) but it does have more
feedback and feels a little toothier. But overall, its been a great pen!"
greyautumnsky,"March 9, 2020","Bought this fountain pen to be a dedicated pen for Noodler's 54th Massachusetts
Blue Black and Kung Te Cheng inks, for writing in my lab notebook. A little
wider than I would like the nib to be, but writes at about a F. However, I like
to use very fine Japanese nibs at home. I'd say this the EF is about the same
width as a LAMY EF, or a Japanese F leaning toward M."
viviannerlw,"March 11, 2019","I don't believe in love at first sight when it comes to pens, specially if I'm
talking of a fountain pen, but... Boy, if it wasn't love at first sight I don't
know what it was when I first saw a TWSBI Eco for the first time! ""A pen that
can hold lots of ink, is easy to maintain and has an extra fine nib? Give me it
now!"" That was my reaction and it was 100% validated when I finally had it in my
hands.The nib is extremely fine tuned, no scratchiness at all, glides over the pages
like butter over hot surfaces, the body and grip areas look huge in the
pictures, but I found them to be just the perfect size for my tiny hands, not
bold enough to be heavy, not thin enough to make me grip like a gorilla on it.
The cap posts perfectly, the clip is solid and, so far, I haven't found a single
notebook cover or pocket it doesn't sticks to. The piston filling mechanism is
easy to disassemble and assemble to clean inside the barrel and the weight when
inked is perfect.Since this pen is an Extra Fine nib, it isn't all too wet, but still has some
nice wetness to it that would allow the use of some shimmering inks for those
who like a more subtle effect in their daily writing.Maybe my only complaint would be the nib size, but that's a matter of personal
preference and doesn't interfere in the performance of the pen at all. I'm more
found of big nibs (#5.5 or #6) and this one is #5, still, nothing that can't be
solved by just holding a little back on the pen, since the threads of the cap
are well polished and doesn't get in the way at all.Overall, I can't help but give this pen a 5 stars rating! (with a bonus 6th star
for the packaging, because honestly, where else will we find a fountain pen
packaging that gives us silicone grease and the proper wrench to take for our
pens without needing to buy it as extras or without being charged more for it?)"

AMAZING VALUE!!! "
J Elgarico,"May 19, 2020","I’ve had this pen for about a year, and I am generally pleased with it. I love
the large ink capacity and the ability to see how much ink I have left. It’s
rather easy to disassemble for cleaning. I sort of wish I had gotten a
non-transparent cap as ink sometimes drops from the nib into the cap. This is my
second fountain pen with the Pilot Metropolitan (F) being the first. I prefer
the Metropolitan’s nib as it puts down a thinner, crisper line. On the other
hand, I understand other people might like the Eco’s nib in comparison, which
to me feels “softer”. As a disclaimer, I have only had one ink in this pen
(Rohrer & Klingner Salix) so other inks might make the pen perform differently."

nicoya,"July 8, 2021","As a fountain pen newbie I started out with a Lamy Safari and a Kaweco Student.
So far the TWSBI Eco is my favorite. For me the grip is more comfortable for

piston or cartridge of the Kaweco. Also, I like a very fine nib, and the extra
fine on the TWSBI is significantly finer than extra find Kaweco. Reliable
workhorse that is easy to fill, holds lots of ink, and is a smooth writer."

David L,"October 3, 2018","This thing holds gobs of ink, writes so buttery smoothly, and feels substantial
in the hand. For my first foray into fountain pens since about middle school
(when I used disposable fountain pens to varying degrees of success) I can't
imagine a better pen. I think they ought to have a similar Eco pen with a solid
opaque color so that it's more discreet while in use--I hate going into a
meeting and having people say something to the effect of ""Oh, fancy pen."" I just
want to write, guys. But it does have a certain amount of cache to be able to
see all the parts, so I may be in the minority in this regard. I avoided the
black or color versions of this because the color block effect was even less
appealing to me. Overall, though, very minor complaints compared to a stellar
writing experience."
vols1,"February 4, 2017","First and foremost JetPens is a superior website and the tedious work these
people put into it such as reviews etc. is exemplary, fascinating, and most

the highest praise and will continue to do business with them.  That said the TWSBI ECO Clear Fountain Pen - Extra Fine Nib was designed by an
Evil Genius from HELL and I believe it would be a great idea if JetPens
mentioned in their description this pen should only be disassembled by a
mechanical engineer with at least a Ph.D.  :)  Right after I got it I filled it
with Diamine Blue Lightning Shimmer Ink and the filling part was very efficient
and easy.  I began writing with it and it did OK to start with then began
skipping.  I figured the particles in the ink were probably the culprit so I
took the pen apart, cleaned it thoroughly, and intended on filling it with Pilot
kon-peki.  About an hour later and near a nervous breakdown I still did not have
the Demon Pen from Purgatory properly assembled.  Thank God YouTube has many
many videos covering this very subject so I didn't feel like a total idiot.  So
after trying everything suggested my pen is still in pieces.  I have come so
close so many times to smashing, burning, crushing, this so as to take one off

john.l.white,"April 12, 2021","I had purchased one of these with a medium nib and liked it however it lays down
a line wider than I like, requiring me to write larger, which actually is a good
thing.  These are inexpensive enough that I just got the EF rather than mucking
about trying to change the nib.  I am very happy with the line it lays.  Indeed
one can write very small with this one.  It does hold a lot of ink.  Something I
have been impressed with on both my pens is that when I take off the cap and put
pen to paper it starts immediately.  There is a seal in the cap that helps keep
the nib from drying out.  One could get a nicer looking pen made from angle dust
flakes but I doubt it would have a better mechanism, which for me is the part I
write with, I buy pens to write with."

illustrations are a bit confusing, these are the instructions on how to maintain
the pen. But I was able to find a YouTube video on how to fill and it really
helped me out. No issues with delivery, actually came 3 days early. If I had any
complaint it would be that the pen rolls a lot when the cap is not screwed on.

I try, i seem to always pull more ink out than i clean off. "

functional details which add to its praise."

clean and set up, the videos that JetPens provides are very helpful. I used
Pilot Iroshizuku Ink and it writes just beautifully in my Hobonichi techo avec
and dries fairly quickly (although I use a regular sheet of 8 1/2"" x 11"" paper
to blot after writing to be safe). I plan on buying another one to be able to
use two inks at a time. I will say however that because of its stylized look (as opppose to something
like the LAMY Safari fountain pen), I don't feel comfortable using it out in
public. I keep it on my hobonichi case's pen loops at all times. Otherwise, definitely worth a buy, especially if you're a beginner or just want
a really cool looking, affordable fountain pen! "

trade it for any other. A couple of times the pen was lost, and I moved sea and

satisfaction with the two sport pens I already own, I believe it will be well
worth the money!"
emilymeath,"September 5, 2018","I received this pen a few weeks ago and it is my first fountain ever! I really
love the weight and feel of it, and the fine nib writes beautifully. It took a
few tries to get the ink flowing, but after that the fine nib is perfection. I'm
using the provided cartridge but also purchased a converter and bottled ink for
when that runs up. I love the way the cap screws on, which makes it feel very
secure. My main issue with the pen is that the cap does not stay on securely
when posted. It's quite loose and often starts to loosen up and often fall off
when writing. And the pen is too short to be comfortable to write with when the
cap isn't posted (it's also less convenient, in my opinion). I'm a bit paranoid
to use it out of the house for this reason, for fear of losing the cap while
writing. I wish the cap would screw on in its posted position too! Something to
be mindful of, but overall it's got more pros than the one con, and it's a
beautiful piece that I will cherish for years to come - and my fiance is jealous
so I may gift one to him! "
dwbosch,"February 19, 2022","Great pen especially with upgraded nibs. Get compliments on it all the time. But

inconvenience.However, I bought this pen at Christmas 2021, and now March 2022, the nib itself
has come loose and can be literally pulled out with the slightest tug. This is
100% a nib problem/defect, and NOT a pen defect, but it is the nib that came
with the pen, so thus the 4/5 stars."

bradtwebster,"September 17, 2022",First fountain pen. It’s awesome! Very rugged and writes well. 
teppi,"August 4, 2022","Amazing aesthetic!  Yes I am a shallow design junkie, always susceptible to
being swayed by a product's looks or packaging.  I have been a hardcore Apple
Pencil user for my work, but lately find myself swinging back to the analogue
side.  I am not a fountain pen expert, but this pen writes very well IMO. Very
smooth, no skips, still can feel the fine feedback / friction of the paper.  The
fine nib is perfect for writing complex characters, like Japanese kanji… or if
your penmanship is naturally small and compact, but I might prefer a M nib for
everyday writing.  I don't find the brass heavy at all; on the contrary, the
weight of it feels very good in the hand.  I realize this is a pocket pen, but I
find it a little short even when posted.  For reference, I'd say I have small to
average female hands, overall height from base of palm to tip of longest finger
is 7"" and total width, from outside of thumb to outside of palm is less than 4"".
I did read up on the dimensions but just went by the product photography.

great but my F nib was a hard starter. I checked it with a loupe and it suffered
from pretty severe ""Baby's Bottom"", unusual for a fine nib. I ran it through
some micro mesh and Mylar paper and now it writes as smooth as butter. This is
my first European pen and the F nib has a line more like a Japanese M. After
several weeks it has developed a nice patina and the only shiny parts are where
my fingers grip the pen. It's truly become my own. I use it as a daily writer at
work and it's always in my pocket along with change, keys, etc... It gets more
""character"" every day!"
jonfabian7,"November 16, 2016","This pen gets five stars despite two issues I have with it. Pilot has managed to
make a perfectly-operating vacuum-fill extra-large fountain pen at an
unbelievably modest price. The filling system works flawlessly and has the added
benefit of an ink shut-off. The nib is one of Pilot's best, and extra smooth
even in an Extra Fine size. Pilot's nibs run narrower than European nibs. The
size and slightly-cigar-shape fit medium to large hands well. The body holds a
tremendous amount of ink, and as it is see-through you always know how much you
have left.Having a see-through ink containers is not 100% good. Some inks will form
clusters on the inside walls of the pen body, especially dark ink. I don't
happen to like this; many others aren't bothered. The other issue is that the
type of resin the pen is made of feels warm in my hand, and not particularly
smooth. These are tiny issues in an otherwise magnificent pen. I would recommend
the Custom 823 to anyone."
Rsahd,"April 1, 2017","This pen is exquisite.  I have put off buying this pen for a couple years, cause
of the price, but it was worth the wait.  Pilot nibs are always great,
consistent writers for me. I did not have to flush this pen prior to writing,
just inked it up with some Kon Peki and it writes like a dream.  The fine nib is
(as expected) very fine.  The large gold nib has the slightest amount of
softness to it (not flex). The vacuum filling system works very well and the pen holds a ton of ink.  I
don't generally like gold trim, but it looks amazing and classy with the
brown/amber body.  I love how sophisticated this pen looks.  There is certainly
some feedback on the fine nib, which I prefer, and is typical for a Japanese
fine nib.  It is a good sized pen, but not too heavy. for someone with medium sized hands
this is perfect when writing unposted.  It would be too long for me to write
with posted. I have a number of pens over $250, but I really think this one will
get the majority of the use through the years.  If you are going to venture
beyond the $150-$200 pen range, this is the way to go."

Bill,"January 21, 2021","Probably would give 4.5 stars if I could. This is a nice sturdy pen with good
heft. The ink is a purple-black color, unusual and very nice. Out of the
ordinary yet a bit dignified. I love it! These Zebra gel pens seem as pleasantly
smooth as any other I have tried, maybe more so. The clip is bulky and odd-looking. This is a consequence of its design, where
you push at the top to open the clip in order to fasten it to thicker items, so
that's a trade-off. The only feature I don't care for is the ink viewing window.
It is at the top of the pen, under the clip, and too dark to really see through.
If you shine a bright light in, you can see the top of the refill inside, but
nothing further down. It can tell you if your refill is nearly full, but it
can't tell you if your refill is nearly empty... which is what you needed to
know."
Drewskaya,"December 2, 2020","Zebra Sarasa Grand pens have been a favorite of mine for a long time.  I have
large man hands, so the heavier weight is more comfortable to me than the
plastic bodied version of the vintage colors.  I was super excited to see the
vintage colors remade into the Grands this year.  I didn't buy all of them right
away, and have had to wait for restocking, so they must be popular!As far as performance, you know what you're getting with Zebra Sarasa ink.  It's
quick flowing, smooth writing, and fast drying (which is important to a lefty
like me).  I only wish they came in a 0.7mm, because I love the thicker line. 
However, the vintage color of the Bordeaux Purple and beautiful pen body make up
for the thinner line. The ink is a nice rich purple/black, so it's work
appropriate as well as stylish for personal letter writing and note taking. I
hope Zebra comes up with more colors because after 2020, we all need something
to look forward to!"
diwadaily,"September 9, 2020","I was a little unsure about getting the Bordeaux Purple of this line of gel pens

travel. I highly recommend it. "

colors, thinking I would swap them in once I'd used this up. However I couldn't
wait and popped the refills into other bodies that I scrounged up (cheap plastic
ones). This metal body is still the best option - I like the weight and
robustness, as well as the look - but I don't like the clip getting in the way
of the button and I wish the pen were chunkier. I bought a Zebra Blen which is
the right chunkiness, but it doesn't take the same refill. I also did a hack and
put one refill into a Retro 51 pen (trim the top, stick on the end but from
another pen to enable twist action) but it's not an easy hack and it doesn't
operate smoothly. At the moment I'm thinking I'll just stick with the original
metal body and add a grip sleeve to bulk it out a little."

ok with large man hands, it's more on the heavy side to be a plastic body.Zebra Sarasa Ink is pretty good, drying fast, and the 0.5mm works well when
limited in space. I also own a much cheaper Sarasa Mark-On that is a fifth of

a 5 star review, but it has one small problem that makes me reach for it less
than I normally would. Unlike the Sarasa Clip or Sarasa Mark On lines, the Grand
pens' clip is extended above the end of the pen body. This mean that the top of
the pen clip blocks you from pressing the retract button on the top from certain
angles, and digs into the side of your thumb from others. In other Sarasa lines
pens, the top of the clip is flush with the top of the pen body, so you could,
for instance, press the button with the palm of you hand and extend the pen tip.
In this model you would only succeed in poking your hand. Not sure why Zebra
would change this, makes clicking the pen a hassle."
jj blooms,"April 27, 2021","I love this pen.  I have the set of the vintage Sarasa clips and this was my
favorite color, when it ran out I decided to spring for the better pen & a pack
of refills.  I think I found my perfect pen!  The weight is lovely, the pen
writes smoothly, and it's just a beautiful pen. "
heather.mazorow,"April 24, 2021","great color choices. Due to brass it has an excellent weight. Refillable ink.
Only negative is the price, but for those who like great pens, it can be easily
look over. "
benjaminfailor,"April 19, 2021",These pens are awesome! Be sure to stock up on refills. 
tdawncreek,"April 14, 2021","This is a gorgeous pen that is perfectly weighted. The color is fun but also
professional.  Definitely a favorite. "
shampton92,"April 10, 2021","I think the one I got has dried ink, it just doesn't write as good as the others
I have bought. I will most likely just change the cartridge. "
otisnwillie,"April 8, 2021","This is a very handsome pen with a rich and unusual shade of purple, so I liked
the color very much along with the heft and slim profile. What I was not so
impressed with is the scratchy roller ball point. It just doesn't write smoothly
for me- perhaps because of the size of the tip. I searched for a 0.7 mm refill
in the same color for it but alas, none to be found."
suziemonte,"February 20, 2021","I admit I did not realize the ink would be the same color as the pen, but never
mind, I use it everyday. The pen is smooth to hold and weighted just right."
WVSPICEYHOTT,"February 5, 2021",love it and the writing is so smooth.
wmbartels,"December 11, 2020",Excellent product. Well made!
troskap,"August 22, 2013","This pen has rapidly become my go-to carry pen in my collection.    It writes
practically the instant it touches paper, regardless of the circumstances.  
I've taken it on numerous surveys and field trips for work and leisure, and in
the wet, the cold, and the heat, it's delivered on being able to write
practically everywhere.   Admittedly, it's not as universally consistent with
more expensive pens such as the Fischer Space Pen and variants, with the line
flagging a bit in the more extreme conditions, but given the price, I'm not
afraid to use the pen for fear of damaging or losing it! Sizewise, it's a little bulkier than it's narrower 0.5mm cousin.   But it has a
much more substantial grip to it than those pens, which makes the pen easier to
hold in my larger-sized hands.   The plastic body is fairly tough, and will take
a good deal of abuse, though I've had the clip snap on one pen after an
ill-advised attempt to hook the pen over too many pages in a notepad. Also, in regards to performance in the wet, I would say that the thinner gauge
can make things a bit easier to tear on cheaper paper, so if you expect to write
a lot in damp conditions, you may want to look at the 1.0mm version, instead. In fact, if you invest in this pen, you'll probably want to buy at least 2 or 3
at a time.   I can guarantee you, people will try to walk off with the pen.  
I've even had a police officer try to take one from me, after he spent a
frustrated night at a cold accident scene, trying to fill out paperwork with a
half-dozen other ballpoints that just wouldn't work.  (I ended up giving it to
him - remember what I said about buying 2 or 3?)"
brenkddr,"May 4, 2015","This is a great pen for anyone who wants a smooth ball point that is pretty
durable.  The grip is comfortable and the fact that it can write on almost
anything in any situation is pretty cool even though most of the time you will
never need those extra features.  The reason I give it a 4 star is because it
leaves somethings to be desired in the clip department, and it is as if Uni
designed a rugged pen but forgot the clip.  The clip is very flimsy feeling and
is not something that I would trust in the pocket.  Also, the ink in this pen
seems to go by fairly quickly so it would probably be good to stock up on  ink
when ordering the pen."
M123,"August 18, 2012","Not as smooth as my jetstream, but very smooth none the less. wrote right of the
package. rubber grip is firm(which is still extremely comfortable) and of better
quality than many many pens out there. great pen for taking notes...  "
djlenz,"June 20, 2015","Writes smooth in any position.  Reasonable price to buy and refill.  It has not
broken or worn out yet.  I suspect the clip will break in rough conditions.  A
nice feature is being able to see (although not clear) the ink supply.  The two
vertical windows are too close to the point making it somewhat uncomfortable to
use.  This is my second pen of choice for EDC.  "
Intermittently88,"February 22, 2012","Great easy-writing pen!  Especially for a writer who seems to be getting
arthritis.  Thanks!!"
kav1,"January 9, 2022","Literally love this pen, super durable and versatile, great for people who
explore the outdoors often and may be caught writing in awkward position or
circumstances. Very smooth and consistent ink."
linhking,"April 8, 2021","Have stayed away from ballpoint pens in the past. This one is exceptional.  It
writes at just about every angle and skipping is not in its vocabulary!"
stephy0804,"February 27, 2020","If my workplace had this pen lying around, I would steal it. That's how good it
is. Writes smooth like a dream; I switch to it when my wrist hurts from writing
with fountain pens or I just need to take notes at light-speed, and voila,
no-effort writing.To note: the 0.7 is actually quite fine and, in my opinion, feels more like a
0.5 ballpoint, but that's totally cool for me. Just keep in mind if you want a
thicker line"
salty,"November 17, 2022","When comparing the tip to other UNI brand tips the 0.7 Powertank appears to be
equivalent to other 0.5 UNI tips. I have about 7 pens I've been rotating through
and every chance I get to write with the Uni Power Tank it is just a pleasure.
Clean consistent lines, no skipping and the perfect amount of paper pen
feedback."
Mort47fish,"September 14, 2022",Easy writing and the larger ball is good for notes at meetings.

mvonderahe,"May 17, 2022",Writes almost everywhere on almost everything. Darn good. 
Mica,"March 26, 2022","Absolutely love this pen. So smooth even in negative Temps when the wind's
blowing like no other. I use this at work alongside the apica water repellent
memo pad to write down my hours and takes notes on jobsites and the two together
are a dream. It seems to write closer to a 0.5mm tip rather than a 0.7mm, so if
you prefer a larger tip size, I'd get the 1.0mm one instead."
kingfish76,"March 13, 2022","This pen is a work-horse! I love the fact that it works well on many different
papers both wood pulp/high rag paper, Tomeo River, and water proof papers (I use
waterproof papers for hiking and camping). The ink dries very quickly and even
works in the rain (yep, I have tested it). If you need a pen that just writes
when you need it to, and don't want to invest in a Fisher this pen is a good
choice."
mail,"March 2, 2022","Writes wonderfully! One of my favorite writers, the pen is comfortable in the
hand. Feels cheap, but for the price I won't refill the barrel, just buy new.
The refill doesn't seem to fit anything else though, which is a small
disappointment. Again, for the price, you can't go wrong though."
SOHare1981,"February 16, 2022","This pen feels great in my hand. I'm really tempted to buy it in blue and red...

them?)"

wwong137,"February 10, 2021","These pens were acquired for emergency use.  Not as smooth and fluid writing as

need to write things down on the go."

jonesfive,"February 1, 2019","After hours of studying medium black or black variation ink pens and purchasing
a dozen I received them and tried them out. I graded them from 7-10 and gave
this one a 9. It is a very nice and smooth writing pen. I would prefer a little heavier line.However, I LOVED the Uni-ball Jetstream RT BLX Ballpoint 1.0 Brown Black one the
most. My wife who generally likes fine points and I both agreed that it is a top
quality pen. I/We will be buying the 5 color set for sure!"
sugarshark,"January 24, 2019","When I first start writing the ink is usually grey and not flowing fully but

its too wide and the tip also feels weird also."
bigbogie,"October 17, 2018","The grip section on these Power Tank pens is a little fat for me, but Power Tank

Art Pal,"July 31, 2018","The 0.7-mm cartridge makes a comparatively thin line, such as one might get from
a 0.3-mm gel pen. I like its infrequent skips and blobs. The grip is fine;
sometimes, I think I prefer a grip that is evenly shaped, whereas with one like
this, I might fuss enough to rotate the pen so that I'm not feeling the
ink-viewing windows (there are two). I have confidence that this pressurized-ink
pen will write immediately, especially as compared with ordinary, inexpensive
ballpoints."

gombuk99,"October 5, 2017","I really love this pen because the tank feature seems to prevent those blots
that happen with ball points, and it's not some crazy expensive thing either.

to enhance shaded pencil drawings, for one thing, and you don't need to worry
about blotting.  So, cool pen!"

joeyldev,"October 30, 2014","I love Fisher Space Pens, so I figured I would like this one.  The pen writes a
little light and skips more than I would like.  I know it's due to the

really really broad) I might use it more often, but it's not a deal-breaker. I
keep it in my bag for those times I need to sign a receipt (not all pens work
well on that thermal paper, and I don't like to use the germ-infested pens that
retailers keep at the counter). It just feels great in my hand; I'm going to

jfchen14,"July 1, 2018","Very smooth, very good pen. The needlepoint is very good for precise work
(drawing and tracing along a template) and doesn't cause any issues with
skipping that I was initially worried about. The ink is a very vibrant black,
even if it's not the blackest black, and it does smear if you don't wait for the
ink to dry. But after the ink dries, it won't budge even if you highlight.
Overall, a fantastic pen for every day use."

without your hand tiring after a while, which is a relief for students like
myself. If you're looking for a cheap pen that writes really really well, this
is the perfect one to use. :)"
megapctr,"September 23, 2014","- The retractable mechanism feels a tiny bit stiff. + You can use this pen with a Uni Jetstream refill - it fits perfectly!+ I love how short the head of this pen is, because I tend to grab pens very
low.+ The gel ink dries incredibly fast, which makes this pen great for
left-handers Final thoughts: It's a wonderful pen. Though I wish it came in even smaller tip
size, like 0.38mm"
etherdonkey,"September 27, 2012","An excellent pen for the cost. The needle tip is very precise and is pretty
durable. The ink, I believe, is as wet and vivid as the Pilot g-2. I believe it
is the same refill as the more costlier Energel needle tips, so you can save
your money and still get the same writing experience. The body of the pen is
opaque black which hides dirt and grime (a dirty pen is something I can't hardly
use) and the clip is sturdy to prevent the pen from escaping from your shirt
pocket; a solid good design for such an economical pen.  Pentel is fast becoming my new favorite in both pen and pencil stationary
products."
nina,"July 20, 2022","yeah baby. you know where i'm going with this: it's perfect. the dry time is
incredible and the needle tip makes me feel fancy when i write with it. if
you're into bullet journaling (and have small handwriting) you definitely
shouldn't pass up on this pen!"
ashleybecker,"December 13, 2021",I would recommend this pen for any lefty! It's definitely one of my favourites. 
namie,"September 4, 2018","This pen is VERY smooth it glides across the paper. Writing takes very little

with the refills, and this weekend will purchase the other colors since I like
to color coordinate my pens, highlighters, notebooks and binders. "
charqu,"April 9, 2020","Not my favorite, but this is a nice pen. Ink is smooth and writes well. However,

Beginner At Things,"June 16, 2019","I loved this pen though it did smear at times, but I'm a lefty. However, the

hold and write with. 10/10, would buy again."
hmurry,"March 1, 2019","I write a *lot* at work, and I love gel pens for how smoothly they write. I do
not love the smearing and gobs of ink they sometimes put down. Not a problem
with these! I have this pen in red, blue, and black. Totally recommend if you
have a lot of writing to do, need to have it small and legible, and need a short
drying time.It does smudge slightly if you drag your hand immediately after writing, but a
few seconds is all it needs to dry. Left handed coworker tried to steal mine."
IkigaiAskew,"February 20, 2019","I love these pens. I am a Pilot G2 fan of many years, until now. The G2s will
always have a place in my heart, but I love the needle point! The quick drying
formula and smooth ink flow beats G2! Just wish they offered more colors. I also
love this transparent body style of the pen over the sporty looking silver look.
I like simple clean styles. I can’t find these anywhere but JetPens without
paying some crazy amount. "

the gel pen sampler because I usually like a finer point of around 0.3mm.

out as one of my favorites in the sampler. I would definitely buy this pen
again.  "

lacirakestraw,"February 6, 2018","Love these pens and bought them in almost every color. I found that I prefer the
0.5 to 0.7 since these pens are pretty inky and the smaller tip makes for more

bleed through on regular binder paper"

dries pretty quickly. "
Rebecca C,"January 8, 2018","Love this so much. It does not smear, which is exactly what I was looking for. I

hernandezvm94,"July 1, 2016","My other favorite pen (my first is the pilot acroball) because it doesn't smear

jasonoelmann,"May 19, 2016","Recently became my go-to pen. All my favorite features in a pen: Retractable,

kateryan54,"October 24, 2022","Love my Platinum Preppy pens!  This is the only pen I’ve been successful at
converting to a dropper fill & it behaves very nicely - no ink gushing out of
the nib on these.  I love dropper fill because I tend to write much longer if
I’m not limited to cartridge colors & I'm still building my ink stash. 
Hopefully some day it will rival my yarn stash!  Lol. Now if we could just get Platinum to include EF nibs.  "
melissapens,"September 13, 2022","Of all the ""beginnner pen"" combos offering a pen and ink that comes with the

inked as it comes, and ready to go even weeks between uses. "

color or more. Maybe all the colors. "
alexandria_bermudez,"April 23, 2022","Love the shade of the ink. However, I have to mention that the pen came shipped
with the barrel detached and I was kinda concerned when it was rattling around
like crazy. It took a minute but I was able to pop it back into place with
enough force. Wondering if it being detached was intentional? Anyway it worked
just fine after that."

great quality and very smooth writing out of the box"
Sarah S,"February 11, 2022","I love the way the Preppy writes. For me it’s so smooth, and is comfortable to
hold, and not to mention super duper affordable. I like to syringe fill my
cartridges, and the Kuretake Karappo empty cartridges fit these! Much cheaper
than a converter. The downside for me is the barrel cracks easily, so I won’t
eyedropper these. I don’t want to deal with an ink spill in my bag! If you
want an upgrade in aesthetics, the Prefounte has the same guts but a chic look,
and still a super affordable entry level fountain pen. "

this price.  Great pen."
fablehill,"June 9, 2020","I love these pens. The ink on this one is a very nice deep violet, with a fairly

kharrisma,"October 5, 2018","I haven't used this one as much as the .02 that I bought at the same time, as
this one was for my wife, but I did spend some time with it getting it set up
and ready to go for her.  It writes smoothly for a fine-tip, very little of the
scratchy feedback that some people find objectionable.  It lays down a generous
fine line that shows the color of the ink well (better than the .02 I got, but
that's just the nature of fine tips; they don't showcase the ink color as well
as the broader tips do.)  The color of the pen is a close match to the violet
ink I bought to go with it, and she loves both the pen and the ink color, too.  
Score for me!  If you're a fan of fountain pens in general, you should be happy
with this pen.  It's a go-to workhorse, not fragile in the least (though you can
wreck ANY fountain pen if you drop it, and it lands... how else?... point down. 
Just don't do that!  That's not good for any pen, even ballpoints.)  I'm quite
happy with it, as is my wife."

Pen in the desert,"November 11, 2021","This pen is astonishingly nice for price. I live in an arid environment at 6500
ft and this is my only pen that doesn't dry out when capped and is therefore
always available to be used whenever I want it (sorry, waterman...). It is very
smooth even on office-supply grade notepads.  I didn't care for the violet ink
as it was more pink than I hoped.  I would say it is fuchsia moreso than purple.
 When the cartridge is used up I will try Diamine Imperial Purple and see how it
works with the pen.  03 is perfect for me for everyday writing. "

meaghan,"December 6, 2020","This was my first fountain pen experience and it has been a joy to write with!
It was easily converted into an eyedropper pen and now I can't stop using it. I
love how it writes and I have not had any problems with skipping, clogging, etc.
With the translucent body, it's also very easy to keep track of how much ink is
left and when it's time for a refill.Unfortunately I couldn't find any way to remove the text or barcode from the
body of the pen, so minus points for aesthetic. But that's minor and has been my
only issue with it so far. It's such a small sacrifice in exchange for getting a
great introductory fountain pen that has the potential to hold a large volume of
ink (when converted) at such cheap price."
sheilasuesides,"November 23, 2020","I enjoy my Platinum Preppies. I modified them, and they leaked badly. But, I got

a fuchsia color, a dark purplish pink."

teamofemus,"May 17, 2011","At long last, I have found the perfect pen. Writes smoothly but still ""grips""
the page, great clip, solid and durable grip. I can't tell if it goes through
ink quickly or whether I'm just using this pen more than all of my others, but
refills at $1.20 (80¢ less than the pen itself) is worth it, in my opinion. A
wonderful, wonderful pen that's a joy to use."
bio95,"March 19, 2012","After trying out a slew of pens for my pocketmod and also a moleskin large
notebook (grid paper ruled) I found this pen at 0.4 size to be the best at small
detail, smooth ink flow (small scratchiness I don't mind), least bleed through
moleskine grid paper. It's the most balanced pen and best compromise for most of
my uses, I will exclusively use it from now, except for the
zebra-Clip-On-multipen which is great for all the colors but ink runs out way
too quickly.   I Compared this pen with Zebra Clip Sarasa 0.3, 0.5 and I found 0.4 the best. 
Signio 207 0.5, and 0.38 were good but either too small and scratchy (0.38) of
ink flow a little more than the paper could handle (0.5) leading to some
smudging and less clean lines. Pilot G-2 0.5 and 0.38 were GOOD, but not as
clean and nice on moleskine graph paper as the Zebra Clip Sarasa 0.4 which after
comparing everything side by side was the best I could come up with. I also like
the quality and feel of the clip (with a true joint pivot point as opposed to
single plastic piece clip as in the G-2) and clicker was nice to click on and
off when lost in thought :) Cons for this pen: is that this pen doesn't have a RED cartridge and its not
free. "
ada.dancer14927,"August 18, 2010","Loved this pen so much, I bought refills for it. It's great. I find the clip a

is great and not to squishy, and the pen is nice and sturdy. Great for my notes."
Wjaa,"October 14, 2012","Excellent pen. I just bought mine at the Mitsuwa marketplace here in San Diego

unparalleled by any of its contemporaries for a pen of this price. All in all, I would strongly recommend this as your first choice if you are
looking for something nice to use as an everyday writer. Excellent pen!!"

Francesca,"February 8, 2021","I bought the Black 0.3 and 0.4 mm after trying the Black 0.5 mm, which I like.
All these tip sizes lay down a richly saturated line which is black even in the
smaller tip sizes. The tips are not scratchy, even on slightly textured paper,
although I feel the grain of paper under the 0.3 mm tip. There is enough
difference in line width between all the tips that warrants getting one of each,
especially since I enjoy writing on small grid ruling. The pen is comfortable to
hold for long writing sessions, and the rubber section makes it easy to grip. I
don’t use the clip, but it feels sturdy, as does the click mechanism. I’m
glad I have the 0.5 mm, as the 0.7 mm might be too inky for me."

much smoother! I didn't even realize a pen could feel like this until I tried
it. I honestly cannot describe the exact smoothness of this pen, you honestly
need to feel it yourself. I will definitely be buying more sizes and colors of
this, and maybe look into some other pens in the Sarasa line."
Clifton R,"October 24, 2020","The Zebra Sarasa Clip is another really nice pen, with a particularly nice grip.

Alex,"July 31, 2020","I admit I was a bit disappointed after trying these out. The body is okay to
hold, with my favorite part being the binder clip by far. However, despite being
consistent, the ink wasn't too smooth, and it felt not scratchy, but like it was
""tugging"" on the paper. I find the Pilot Juice to be smoother (albeit still a
bit ""tuggy"") for it to have the same qualities as this pen (binder clip and
similar body style). Funny enough, I found the Zebra Sarasa Dry to be smoother
than the Push Clip and the Mark-On, so I'd reccomend that instead. Overall, not
too satisfied with this product. "

I've only made it though two of them so far, but it would seem to me that they
run though ink quicker than I would like.  Full disclosure: I write about 25
hours of my 40 hour work week, so I probably chew though ink faster than most
people.  So, for me, I would have liked the well to have more ink in it.  As it
stands, the well is 3 1/2 inches long and it filled to 2 1/4 inches.  I don't
know anything about pen construction, but just looking at it, It would appear
that they could get away with filling it to 2 3/4 - 3 inches full.  It's my only
gripe and it's minor, this is still my favorite click pen on the market."

ogoner12,"October 2, 2017","Near perfect pen. The clip is amazing, it clicks satisfyingly, it writes
smoothly. The only gripe I have with it is just that it feels kind of cheap in
your hand. Compared to its competitors, namely uniball signos, pilot juice, etc,
it just feels kind of cheap in the hand. The ink is dark though, and it writes
surprisingly smooth for such a small tip size. Just wish it felt less like a G2

dorn9503,"November 12, 2015","This pen writes quite smoothly.  I like to print really small, and this pen does
well in that application.  The ink does dry relatively quickly, but it still
smudged slightly in a 'workbook' application.  I am not sure what to call the
paper type, it is similar to what would be found in any school book, slightly
glossy with full color printing in places.  To me the difference between the
line size of this pen and .5mm isn't noticeable enough for me to choose this out
of the assortment I am testing."

elmnt,"October 29, 2014","Love the writing experience (pen-in-hand feel, ink, ink flow, etc.). I switched
from a Pilot G-2 only because of the weird shape of the rubber grip (the Zebra
Sarasa has a ""flatter"" grip). But so far every pen in the box I purchased has a
loose push clip. The effect is the ink cartridge does not extend all the way
down the barrel, when it's loose, and the writing tip is not sticking out all
the way. I have to continually ""double click"" it during use to push the clip
back down. Very annoying. I'm sure it's just a defective batch (maybe?), but
I'll just go back to the G-2, as I'm not going to bother trying another
purchase, and risk the same defect."
2groovy,"December 18, 2013","I firmly believe this is the best pen you can get for under $20.  The 0.4mm is
good all around if I had to pick one size, and the 0.3mm is great for
ledger-type work with limited writing space.  I've tried every size except the
1.0mm, and they all write beautifully.  Test drive one, and I assure you won't
be sorry. :)"
bmsgator,"September 12, 2013","The included ink cartridge stopped working only after a few hours of use. I

akabose11,"September 5, 2013","This pen is one of the better clicker pens that I have used. The clip can come
loose if you fidget with it a lot. The ink color is very nice,and the body is
very sturdy. I have a special way to make this pen better, though. Through some
sort of wacky coincidence, the UMR-85 (used for UM-138 pens) fits perfectly into
this pen. Since I quite like Uniball ink,I just switch the ink tubes between a
uniball ultra fine signo you can get at staples and this one. I apologize for all the bad grammar and stuff."

this just might be it. The smoothness and vibrancy of the Pilot G-2 with the
sharpness and consistency of the Uni Signo RT. Really, this is what the G-2
should have been. Fans of the Signo may find it a little on the wetter side, but
if you don't mind an extra second or two of drying time I would strongly
recommend giving the Sarasa a try. Plus, with the Sarasa you get access to a full range of colors, unlike the RT

Wong N,"June 23, 2016","I am a nurse and a pen enthusiast, and this is my pen.  When I choose a pen the
requirements are: must be black, must be top button click retractable (it's by
far the fastest to deploy), and must be fine point (under 0.5mm).  I've chosen
this pen over the 0.3 Zebra Sarasa Clip, and the 0.38 Uniball Jetstream (and the
older 0.38 Uniball Signo UM 138).  Advantages:-The finest pen I've ever found that is still top button click retractable.  I
find it to still be noticeably finer than the 0.3 Zebra Sarasa, although not by
much.-Incredibly consistent line over a wide variety of pressures and writing speeds
(including very rapid).  Compared to the 0.3 Zebra Sarasa, I've found it to be
more consistent and less susceptible to ink clumping, or at least the slight
increase in fineness makes it less noticeable-Out of the pens listed above, I've found this pen to be the fastest drying and
least susceptible to smudging-The look is simplistic, yet sleek and different from typical boring click pens.
 -The spring for the click mechanism is integrated into the pen.  This is a very
minor thing, but it does mean that it's impossible to drop or lose the spring.Disadvantages-It has difficulty writing on certain unorthodox surfaces without applying
significant pressure, and even then it's very inconsistent.  This includes skin
and nitrile gloves (I think it's due to the extremely small ball size having
issue with textured surfaces).  I had no issue writing on either with the Zebra
Sarasa.  This is a major disadvantage for me and I've considered switching for
this reason alone, although gel ink is not a great choice in general for writing
on non paper surfaces.-Lacks the spring loaded binder clip of the Zebra Sarasa-Disadvantages associated with very fine tip pens.  These include: writing feels
less smooth, cannot write at very shallow angles, and writing with too much
pressure can damage the tipI have not tried the 0.38 Pilot Juice or the 0.3 Pentel Slicci, and the Pilot
FriXion does not qualify due to being temperature sensitive and erasable (I also
find the line to be inconsistent and not dark enough) along with not being top
button click.  All the pens I mentioned at the top are excellent pens however.  This one just
happens to draw the finest line while still being extraordinarily consistent and
not feeling scratchy.  Also of note, Uni-ball offers the same ink in the same
thickness (and pencil components too) for their customizable multipen body."
BruhBruhsterson,"February 3, 2015","Writing another review because... why not? I love these so much that the two I

yizhouzoe,"September 30, 2018","Anyone actually see how little ink in this pen? The wall of the refill is so

dlewis78731,"January 3, 2018","The strong point of this pen is that it writes very nicely, maybe the best of
the retractables I've tried.  It looks cool, but the clip isn't  that great, and
making it part of the retraction mechanism was a loss for function, and a win
for style.  My problem with it is that if you are pushing the pen into your
pocket, you are pushing on the part that causes the point to come out, and the
pen has a rubber grip, which resists being pushed into the pocket.  Between the
two, when you put it into your pocket, the point is pushed out, which is exactly
what you don't want."

handwriting so the fine tip makes it easier to write things more clearly. The
only downside is that if this is the only pen you write with you will run out of

find the 0.38 mm RT1 smoother than the same-sized Signo DX. Sometimes, I write
with these pens on larger ruling just because I like them so much, even if
there’s need to go that thin. Even so, the text remains readable and doesn’t
look like a spider’s web!"
cansnow919,"January 21, 2021","It's much darker and thicker than Pilot 0.25. Good for the waterproof. HOWEVER,
THE INK TUBE IS MUCH SMALLER THAN OTHER GEL PENS! It used up too quickly."

jasnija,"December 16, 2020","I work as a microbiologist so documentation is 75% of my daily routine. These
pens are perfect for me. The ink is smooth, doesnt smear, leaves a dark imprint,
and doesnt wash away in presence of water or organic solvents such as methanol
or IPA. The tip is also quite thin so it’s easy for me to write very small if
I need to. Delivery is also quick considering where they are made and where I
live. I will continue to buy these pens as long as I can! "
tanishavaish123,"December 16, 2020","The pen tip was a little too fine for my lilking. I had a similar pen from the
same brand, and that one was great, but it was 0.38 mm (I would highly recommend
that one). The ink was good and vibrant. Also, because it had such a small tip,
it made a scratching noise against the paper when I wrote. The grip of the pen
was not so great either. It was soft and prevented the pen from slipping, but it
wasn't ergonomic. "

pinkkinsanity,"August 4, 2020","I really enjoyed this pen! I generally love 0.28 pens and have been using their
gel pens for years. My go-to usually is the UM-151 (the one with the cap) but
decided to give this click-y version a try. I've been loving it! It's a little
scratchier than the capped version but I still really enjoy using it. Highly
recommend!"
elliotzais,"July 17, 2020","This pen is excellent for writing in small spaces like a checkbook register or a

pennerd,"December 26, 2017","DON'T GET THIS PEN. Get the capped one instead as the inkflow is much much
better and the barrel is much more comfortable to hold. Besides that it's an
okay pen I guess - the ink tends to run out quickly and I don't really like the
thickness and tackiness of the barrel. The refills also don't fit into any of
the other pen bodies I own."

paper I've used. Be sure to avoid paper with any coating (heat transfer paper is
a big one) as the coating may foul the tip and interfere with the ink flow."

plastic clip but the tip and ink is a smooth write."
amytsoileau,"May 24, 2017","This is my go-to super fine-tipped pen. It writes very consistently. I am on my
second one after my first ran out of ink, and although the ink supply looks
relatively sparse, because of the fine line it writes, it lasts plenty long
before running out. I have not had any trouble with skipping or with it stopping
working before running out of ink. The tip is durable unlike other super
fine-tip pens, and it is not finicky like some of the others, either. I found
the Pilot Hi-Tech C needle tip pen to feel too fragile (the tip, that is) and
finicky, the Pilot Juice and Zebra Sarasa to have lighter black inks than this
pen, and the Pentel Slicci to run out of ink too quickly. Thank you Jetpens!!!"
penreviews,"May 4, 2017","I cannot fully express how useful this pen has been this semester!! It allows me

little bit) and is comfortable to use. "
Geslina,"May 4, 2017","I LOVE these pens!  Smooth, clean, beautiful, fine line every time.  I'd had
some initial concerns that the barrel would be too thick, and it is bigger than
what I like, but this pen is very comfortable to write with.  My only complaint
is that, like the other Uni-ball pens I have, it runs out pretty fast.  Small
price to pay for such a great pen, so I'll keep buying them.Also wish it came in more colors...."

they produce a very clear fine line, and I'm able to write incredibly small
letters if necessary--which it can be for very full days that are limited to a 3
sq in section of a page. The grip is also quite comfortable. "

Joshua,"December 3, 2016","I love Uni-Ball micro-point pens! They've become all I ever use at work and
home.I've amassed quite a collection of their .38mm varieties over the years, but I'd
never tried the smaller .28mm before now for fear that it would be pushing the
bar a bit too far and the writing would be scratchy - But, not so! Easy to say,
I have a new obsession. It writes just as flawless as the .38mm leaving a
precise, but bold line. I love this clickable version just for the ease of use
at work & the grip extending closer to the nib gives you even more comfortable
control vs the capped versions.Highly recommend Uni-Ball micro points in general, but this .28mm version is a
phenomenal find. Try it!"

the way to the point."

sc00bysnaks,"April 9, 2016","Nice pen. Super light with a really satisfying click. The ink runs smooth as
butter and the body of the pen is nice and solid. One gripe: The ink runs out
too fast. Even with the miniscule nub the amount of ink in the cartridge is
laugable and runs out very quickly. If this pen came with the same amount of in
the Pilot G2 came with then this pen would amazing."
taylor12111991,"April 5, 2016","I am utterly in LOVE with this pen! I have never found gel ink pen that's thin

jina100,"February 24, 2016","This is a great pen. It definitely met my expectations for Uni-ball products. I

then dropping the pens, which almost always break the tips... ack. Hopefully no
more with these retractable pens!The body is a little more lightweight than I expected, but I think my husband
likes it just fine."

the same reason, but I think this one is just a tiny bit finer.....   I will buy
more, for sure."
william,"November 15, 2015","Coming from the UM-151, I expected an improvement from the ""rounded edges""
technology.However, it seems that this pen has a narrower writing angle that it tolerates
and is more prone to skipping. This may be caused by me putting too little
pressure onto the pen tip, as there is a spring behind the ball. Nevertheless,
it seems that inkflow is slightly reduced.Having the clicking mechanism is nice for me to take around, but also makes it
rougher to write with.One thing I love about this pen is the grip, though. It does not protrude from
the pen body, and extends very close to the tip. This is great for me because I
hold the pen sometimes lower than the grip."
1968eric,"October 6, 2015","Feels nice in the hand, and the retract mechanism feels reliable and solid. I
will be reordering more of these, but in a larger sized tip to fit my personal

But, I've filled two A5 pages of good paper and some lines almost no ink gets
laid down. Even when it is laying ink down fairly well, the pen doesn't feel it
flows well. Perhaps the pen I received is defective. I'll never know; back to
Pilot HiTecs for me; they may not be as comfortable to hold, but they actually
do enable me to write."
DIPSYDUO,"December 15, 2014","The Pilot 0.3 mm is very good for fine writing. The finest one available has
been 0.5 mm, so am very happy with it. My daughter likes the fact that it is
shorter than regular ball points, and fits better in her purse. I personally
prefer this Signo RT1 -155 Gel Ink pen , 0.28 mm because I have large hands and
the pen fits it better. Also appreciate that the point is slightly smaller than
the 0.3 mm"
Bella Marie,"November 29, 2022","This is my first fountain pen outside of the lower end priced pens and I am so
impressed by how much ink it holds, how easy is was to clean out, the smooth
writing quality coming from their medium nib that I'm so happy this was my first
ECO! The glow feature is a really cool bonus and color. Gonna cross my fingers
on the restock of the purple glow ECO in a fine nib!"
SJ K,"October 16, 2022","Doesn't glow as much as you'd think unless you keep it under a direct desk lamp
for the evening. Otherwise it's the same pen you love or don't for its charms
and failings. Medium nib works well with a wet ink."
aeri,"April 23, 2018","I wish there were more colors!I own these and the Retro colors. I personally prefer the muted palette of the
retros but these are true to color pastel shades. I like these better than the
Mildliners. I didn't like the Mildliners since they're comparatively darker
saturated colors and they bleed through my Field Notes and copy paper. The
Iconics were great in the fact they were lighter in colors and didn't
bleedthrough. I'm using them in my bullet journal (Kyokuto F.O.B COOP W Ring
Notebook) and they hardly have any ghosting on the other side. Same results in
my Lihit Lab Twist Ring Notebook paper. I haven't tried them with my fountain
pen inks. I definitely use the fine tip side a lot more than the chisel tip but
that's because I write tiny and I love using plastic nib markers. I know there's a million choices for markers out there. I own Triplus, Stabilo
88, Frixion and Tombows (not that these are fair comparisons) but these guys get
stuck in my pen case and are my everyday carry for just a touch of color in my
notebooks. Fair warning, I recently flew with these guys in my carry on. I
didn't notice until I came home on my return flight but it looked like they had
""gushed"" a bit inside the cap (no leakage outside the pen) and I had to clean
out ink in a few of the markers on the fine tip side. I don't know what happened
but it didn't bother me because I also occasionally fly with my fountain pens.
Cleaning up ink is just normal for me."
mckennakestler,"May 8, 2018","I got these because I saw JetPens recommended them for gel based ink. I pretty
much exclusively use Muji .38 for note taking, and I found my Zebra Mild Liners
smearing the ink quite a bit. So that's what I was looking for in these
highlighters, was for it to not smear the ink.That being said, its pretty much a 50/50 chance it will/will not smear it. I
find that I have to wait, usually I finish the page of notes until I add
highlighters. And even then, I take my finger and press it against the word just
in case. Even with all that, it sometimes smears it. But it 100% is better than
the Zebra Mild Liners at smearing. One other con is that I don't think these should be advertised as pastel shades.
Again, I wanted these to replace my Zebra MildLiners, so I wanted them to be
pastel shades as they are advertised. I would say only the purple and maybe the
orange are pastel/muted shades. The blue, pink, and the green are beautiful
colors, but they're very bright especially in comparison to Zebra Mild Liners.
The green ended up being my favorite shade though."
julielawstudent,"December 2, 2021","These colors are beautiful and so gentle. They match perfectly with the pastel
shades of my Hobonichi Techo 2022 planner <3"

amweinberg,"October 22, 2018","I really enjoyed using the highlighter side of these pens, but I found that the

haydoncherry,"December 26, 2022",Ideal for underlining and highlighting.
sciencey23,"August 2, 2022","TL;DR - Pretty good highlighters, would recommend! You know stationary is good
if it even performs well on low-quality paperThe long story of this purchase is that I was looking at my old school supplies
and realized I rarely use highlighters anymore because I hate most of my school
stationary. Highlighters and markers bleed through US notebook paper really
easily, and I have tension problems with writing, meaning it happens to me a lot
more. I researched a ton of highlighters, and settled on these as the winner.
And I am very pleased with them! Even on low-quality paper, they don't bleed
easily. They ghost a bit if you layer, but it's not distracting and I use
low-quality paper anyway. These highlighters don't smudge most of my inks, and
the fine tip is really helpful to avoid too much layering. If you're not a fan
of slightly scratchy pens, the small tip might not be for you, but it works for
me. I also love that the color is saturated and legible when written with, but
isn't distracting with text. Definitely would recommend these over Zebra
Mildliners if you like the look of those but also have tension issues and
low-quality paper. "
hayleeswinford,"May 12, 2022","Pretty good! Some of the colors are a lot more highlighter-y than I was hoping
for, but the quality is good."
JC Draws,"March 6, 2022","I use these as my ""sketch layer"" drawing tools in my journal - the fine tip is
very light (for all colors but pink, the pink color is a lot more
pigmented/intense than the others imo) and useful for drawing a light sketch on
the page and then using pen to ink overtop the marker drawing. I then use the
chisel side of the marker to color or shade the drawing. Not it's intended use
I'm sure, but having a great time with them anyway! "
jbarge95,"February 13, 2022",Love these for notetaking and highlighting book passages.
brittanymmccall,"January 17, 2022","They’re just a liiiitle too pastel. I thought I might be able to write with
the fine-tip end and it’s a little too transparent to read. Great highlighters
though. "

moth,"September 19, 2021","I bought these and the Retros. The colors were a bit hit-and-miss, and had a

and fine (when it's not leaking), but they probably won't end up as my go-to
highlighter set."

alasley,"May 7, 2021","I used the guide to pick these for highlighting over fountain pen ink. Sadly
they smeared both Waterman and Diamine on Maruman and Black'n'Red papers. I'm
only docking one star, since I've never used the testing ink (Herbin Perle
Noire) and it must not be nearly as wet as the other two. Still great
highlighters, just don't serve the exact purpose I wanted them to."

naomi,"July 30, 2020","I am sad to say that despite the JetPens article The Best Pastel Highlighters
saying this one works with fountain pens, it really does not. It smears it very
badly (on fresh and days' old writing alike) and the tips of the markers get
discolored. They might of course be using different fountain pen ink, but maybe
they should specify that then. It doesn't work with Waterman or Pelikan ink. Since these are markers and not highlighters, the broad tip doesn't cover a
single line of my writing, they're not broad enough, and so I don't like using
them for any kind of highlighting. I have to go over every word twice to
completely cover it and if the two lines accidentally overlap, that part gets a
bit rough and not so nice. I would not recommend these as a highlighter, but as
pastel markers they're pretty good. The yellow is not a pastel."

options other than my usual go-to's, such as the Uni Props Window and Zebra

cathy,"June 26, 2020","I collect TWSBI pens. The EF isn't as fine as a Kaweco EF, but I still love
writing with TWSBI. I paired this Prussian Blue pen with Pilot Ku Jaku ink and
it's a perfect color match in my opinion. Great pen!"
cousinsjw,"July 17, 2020","I love this pen. The EF nib is the perfect width and ink outlay for my writing
style (I write within the lines of college-ruled legal pads, for instance- which
is to say not very large). The only reason I knock off a star is because the
materials of the pen do mean that I have to apply just a little more pressure
when writing in order to write. With metal body pens, or with plastic pens that
use gold nibs, I don't have to apply as much pressure.Despite that, the writing experience is still very nice, and on top of that, the
pen itself is gorgeous. I was very drawn to the Prussian Blue trim, and I'm very
happy with my decision. This is a prized member of my pen collection by now."
heathwang7,"January 4, 2021","Absolutely beautiful and writes like a dream. I was worried about the nib being
way too fine (I've had some not so good experiences with extra fine nibs) but
it's perfect. It writes super juicy and I'm surprised that there's even shading
with the Lie de The ink I filled it with. When I first used it I was a bit
concerned about this white powdery stuff coating the piston mechanism so I took
it apart to see what it was and I think it's just from the grease? It comes off
it you touch it, but I just figured I should probably leave it there."

yakanbakla-atv,"February 4, 2021","I've always been impressed by TWSBI pens. Out of my collection of pens, my
TWSBIs have sat inked up and unused for as long as a month and started writing
without even a skip. When I saw this, and realized I could match it up to the
Diamine Prussian Blue ink, well, I knew I had to have it. The extra fine nib is
smooth (IMHO). The section girth and weight are perfect for me. The flow is just
right. I think the quality is pretty much unmatched in this price range."

Traveling Nomad,"July 17, 2020","Love the color of this pen. The nib is pretty wet and the ink distributes in a
smooth, even flow. I was a bit disappointed with how much ink actually gets
stored in the piston-fill reservoir. It seems like a lot of ink storage capacity
gets wasted. But it's a quality pen that looks great!"
cleo mkathy,"January 26, 2021",Super smooth to write with but bleeds too easily on less refined papers.
Keen,"January 4, 2017","I don't have many fountain pens, and so have little to compare this to, but its
easily the best writing implement I own, without a doubt. This pen is heavy -
heavier than it looks, but it sits really nicely in the hand and I haven't yet
gotten fatigued from using it yet.It does smell like brass, which may be bothersome to some people, but I quite
enjoy the smell so that was a plus for me. Being brass, it tarnishes as well,
which again, depending on who you are, may not be a desired look. (I quite like
it.) All in all I love everything about this pen except maybe the nib weight,
which is a little broad for my tastes. But that's easily swapped out.This was intended as a BIFL purchase - let's hope I never lose it, otherwise I
see it serving me well for years to come!"
mannytorriente,"November 19, 2019","Excellent, good looking pen that writes smoothly without clogging. Brass is
durable and easy to clean and shine, so you can keep it looking like new, or let
it develop a unique patina, whichever you prefer. The pen is compact, posts
well, and just heavy enough to make it comfortable to write with it without
being too heavy. I would recommend it to anyone who uses a fountain pen on an
every day basis."
One eyed Jack,"October 20, 2019","I love the Kaweco Sport fountain pens in the medium and larger nib sizes. The
brass pen feels solid in the hand and the larger nib sizes put down ink without
the scratchy feel of the smaller nibs. The pen's appearance improves with use as
the brass darkens up. This pen is, along with the steel and bare aluminum
Sports, the pens that are most likely to survive daily pocket carry without
noticeable damage. Very comfortable in the hand when posted. "
eyeater,"May 8, 2019","Loving this pen! It's pretty much replaced my Kaweco Allrounder for everyday
carry. I got a clip for shirt-pocket use, but I found I never used it and took
it off (too heavy for shirt pockets anyway). This pen is supposed to be dropped
into your pants pocket with your keys, and acquiring little scratches and
""patina"" are part of its charm. You can polish it up with Brasso if you want,
but it re-oxidizes in a week or so. I got the medium nib, and it writes great,
and the ink cartridges seem to last a pretty long time. The barrel's not long
enough to store a spare cartridge (like the Allrounder) but that allows for a
nice compact pen in your pocket."
matt.jolley,"February 14, 2019","For EDC you can’t really go wrong with this brass Kaweco.  I ordered  mine
with a bride nib  and it had a difficult time starting up. That said, I followed
up with the jet pens team and they sent me some instructions to work on my nib a
bit. Now it is perfect! "

avfreq,"November 14, 2022","My favorite of all my Kaweco's, dont get me wrong I LOVE all my Kaweco's, but
this one is my favorite. I guess its because of how it patina's over time. I did have an issue with this one. The silver Kaweco cap fell off after only
having this pen for a few days. Luckily it came off while writing on my desk,
anywhere else I may have lost it. I put the pen under a microscope and realized
not enough glue had been used to adhere the cap. I am not sure what kind of glue
Kaweco uses, but it didnt look like a glue that would last for years. After cleaning the area where the cap is seated and roughing the edges of the
silver Kaweco logo cap for better adhesion, I mixed a small amount of JB Weld
epoxy and added small amounts and seated the cap in place. I cleaned the area
and allowed the epoxy to dry for 24 hours and my pen was as good as new,
probably even better. At least I know I wont be losing the little silver cap
anytime soon."
RWMark,"October 1, 2022","I love this pen. It's easily my favorite fountain pen. I carry it with me

mrichards0321,"September 14, 2022","This is a sharp looking pen but in the end I found it to be too heavy. I much

courtneyagoss,"July 24, 2017",The pen was a little hard to figure out on had to get the ink in the pen.   
Greg,"August 22, 2020","I had a VP several years ago that I sold very shortly after I bought it. Then I
realized that the only thing I did not like about the pen was its finish (I
compromised by buying a blue carbonesque that was in stock rather than being
more careful about my selection of a finish). But the convenience of a click
fountain pen still intrigued me years later, so I decided to give this one a try
and find it as beautiful as it is functional. Because of the convenience of the
click mechanism, my plan was to make it my everyday shirt pocket pen at the
office, but it's so beautiful I treat it with kid gloves and keep it stored in a
pen roll unless I am actually using it, and I only use it at home! I will be
very sad when the finish suffers its first scratch.The converter doesn't look like it holds much ink, but that may just be an
illusion from the fact that some of the converter is not visible. It writes a
bit dry, but experiment with your inks until you find one that flows well
through the pen. For mine, J. Herbin Eclat de Saphir works OK, but I am still
experimenting and will soon be trying Monteverde Horizon Blue because I hear
Monteverde inks are ""wetter"" than most."
Kevin S,"May 19, 2018","I just received this pen today. Once again, excellent service from Jet Pens. My
order arrived 1 day after I received the email saying it was shipped. The pen is
absolutely wonderful. It writes smoothly wrote out of the box with a little
feedback. The ink flow is consistent, and doesn't seem to have the same problem
playing many of Pilot's other dry pens. It's not incredibly wet which helps with
the dry time, but there are no had starts, or skipping during the writing
process. I'm very please with this pen and it is a fine writing instrument
guaranteed to last. "

joeyendres,"April 1, 2013","These pens are outstanding, a must for every cartoonist and ink artist, and
still an amazingly a well-kept secret.  The control is far superior to the
Faber-Castell brush pen, the colors are crisp and sharp, and they make it much
easier to get that ever-elusive sharp point.  They can also be used to accent
work done by Prisma or Copic Markers.  I've done my last three comic pages using
the black - so much faster and sharper, and with more variation and flair.  I'm
also using them for convention appearances for quick sketches and sketch cards. 
Do yourself a favor and scoop up a set."
joeyendres,"April 1, 2013","I should have added - store them upside down, point down.  Gravity helps with
the ink flow."
Nattosoup,"March 22, 2015","These pens are great for inking, although the nib is a little soft for my
personal taste (I'm heavyhanded).  I've tested a lot of fude pens, and while
this isn't my overall favorite, the fact that they are not only affordable but
available in a wide variety of colors makes them an enticing addition.  If
you're an artist looking to add a little color to your sketches, the Pentel
Touch is a strong choice."
diwadaily,"July 11, 2018","As a beginner at brush lettering, I've been using the Pentel Fude Touch brush
pen for daily practice and I enjoy using it! It took some time getting the hang
of managing the weight I put on each stroke, but the tip is firm enough that I'm
able to control my strokes after getting the hang of the pen. I'll eventually
try others, but this is one pen I'm happy to use and recommend. "
kimcondra,"November 3, 2016","I love this pen and the others I got with my order.  I wanted to try brush
calligraphy so I went out to my local craft supply store and bought what they
had.  The tip on that pen was too brush-like and my attempts were awful.  I
decided to buy a few of the pens I read about from other brush calligraphers and
I am so glad I did!  The tip on this pen is wonderful.  I have been using it now
for a couple of days and it is still working great."
100 Friendly Bees,"October 4, 2016","This pen is the first felt tipped brush pen that i ever used. The ink is nice,
but not waterproof or refillable, and it ran out incredibly fast. I did use it
nearly constantly for a few months, so i wasn't surprised when it happened.
Also, the nib wore down really fast. It had been rounded off for so long that
when i came back to write this review and saw the fine, sharp tipped pen in the
photo i was really surprised! Was mine ever like that? Wow!Now, i did recieve this pen as a gift from a very heavy handed friend... The pen
was new, but who knows if they tested it first? I have seen that person split a
micron nib right in half.So this could be the result of two things: the nib is felt and just couldnt
withstand the constant use of an artist who is prepping for school; or it was
blunted before it was even given to me.I suspect the former as i have never been a fan of felt tipped pens. I haven't
found a brush with real bristles that has a small enough brush that it actually
feels like drawing and not painting, so i am moving over to the zig mangaka
flexible pens (waterproof ink) and i will be gentle with those pens and their
felt nibs."

flexible over time. The ink is bold and what I wanted."
zl081000,"January 2, 2020","I like the pen. I probably don't like it as much as everyone else. People I work

Maggie,"January 31, 2019","I have been using this same pen to brush letter for more than a year already (I
bought this pen on 7/28/2017 and I use it everyday) and it finally started to
show that it is starting to run out of ink (although it still can write nicely).
I love this pen, and I am very happy that a single pen can last me this long (
and the tip is still in good shape). I have some other reviews, and they seem to
only last a few months for them, so I’ll tell you how I take care of this pen:
I wouldn’t recommend this to beginners since the tip is pretty soft and if you
are just starting, this pen will be hard to use (if you are just starting I
recommend the Tombow Fudenosuke Brush Pen in the hard tip and the Zebra
Disposable Brush Pen In the extra fine tip size). I would recommend this pen who
have already gotten used to using a brush pen (and have more control). And it
would be best if you use this pen on smooth paper and not lined or copy paper
since it might fray the pen (even though I still use this pen on those types on
paper lol). I don’t really have a way to store the pen, I usually just store
it in my pencil case. Overall, I have been really enjoying this pen, and at the
moment it is my most favorite brush pen."
jessy.klain,"June 17, 2018","Love this! It's a tie between this pen & my tombow fude. I have seen many
recommendations for this pen & I'm happy to have this in my beautiful collection
of brush pens! I love: the ink flow, the strong black color, the felt tip that has the right
amount of flexibility to create fun hand lettered art, the cap has a clip to
hold onto a paper & ultimately how the shape of the tip is well maintained after
weeks of writing. (I have been writing/doodling a lot, everyday for 2 weeks.)
With the great amount of use, I am noticing the ink is lightening a bit, which
means I will have to repurchase. :) I wish there were more color options available, rather than 12. Though, 12 is a
good variety.You will not regret this purchase if you're into hand lettering."

pen is really great to use. "
julesmn14,"September 12, 2021","This is my favorite black brush pen. It's a perfect blend between the fudenosuke
hard and soft tip and you can write big brush letters or smaller lettering too."
margherital,"September 11, 2021","Excellent beginner brush pen. I am new to calligraphy but I have made some
really nice things with this."

jenniffer181920,"August 8, 2021",Perfect!
Anna,"August 3, 2021","This is a fantastic small brush pen! This was my very first brush pen, and it
was super easy to work with. It has lasted me a year of constant use, and the
tip is in perfect shape and the ink is still going strong. Really recommend this
to beginners at brush lettering and to anyone who wants a small but high quality
brush pen."
studypeonies,"August 2, 2021","Nice! Bought this because Studyquill recommended it for beginners. I am not
disappointed. I’m a beginner, and this is much better than the fudenosuke. So
much control!"

typewriter667,"July 1, 2021","I've never owned a brush pen before but now I am hooked. I want this pen in
every color. I have no issues with smudging even though I write with my left
hand and it doesn't bleed through on any paper I have used so far. There is
sometimes minimal ghosting but I don't mind that at all. Don't hesitate to buy
this! "

maryschoi,"October 23, 2020",my favorite brush pen
Btshails,"October 12, 2020","This is my absolutely favorite basic brush pen. Easy to control, smooth as
butter to use even when switching directions, nice deep black ink but doesn't
bleed super easily. Generally just a great pen. I would say it is comparable to
the tombow fudenosuke in soft tip but much more comfortable to write with. If
you started with the Tombow in the hard tip and have found the control of that
is best for you the extra fine version of this pen is very similar to that one.
I think really anyone that is starting with brush pens should give this one a
try cause you may think tombow is the end all be all but this is really the best
brush pen for beginers in my opinion!"
000laurel000,"October 10, 2020","I'm just getting started with brush pens, and I have absolutely loved the Pentel
Fude ones - after trying just a couple, I ended up ordering a bunch more colors.
They have a good amount of flexibility that allows me to make really fine or
decently wide lines, and are overall just fun to use. I would definitely
recommend these!"
rahurst1947,"October 5, 2020","I'm an artist and bought these to sign some of my work. They turned out to be
perfect for the task."
Mellanie.audrey,"October 4, 2020","New favorite brush pen. It doesn’t fray like my felt tip brush pens do, and
I’ve been using one of these every day for a few weeks and it still works just
as well! "
leslimmejia,"September 30, 2020","I was really scared to buy these brush pens because most small brush tips are
hard felt tips, which I'm not a fan of. I like the flexible, softer tips. I was
pleasantly surprised that these pens are VERY flexible and still retain their
shape. They are smaller than tips such as the Tombow Fudenosuke pens, so they
work well for headers for notes! One problem is that they smudged REALLY badly
when I used highlighter over them. That's just my style of notetaking, though. I
can work around that. "
cz1leaf,"September 28, 2020","Love just about everything about this. Calligraphy made easier! Only gripe is
that its not as easy to revert back to thin lines after thicker ones, requires a
extremely light touch and control. "
akshayakaranam13,"September 16, 2020","I prefer this over the Tombow Fudenosuke. The tip is more flexible and a bit
bigger, also great thin upstrokes. However, the cap is not very secure and is a
'pop in' closure that seems a bit loose to me."
plurwarriokandikid,"September 13, 2020",It was good but wish it was slightly larger.
Lupita,"September 10, 2020","This is the perfect beginner brush pen. I used this for the first time without
any calligraphy skills and it turned out great!"
charlettepretzer,"August 31, 2020","I was searching for an alternative to Tombow Fudenosuke brush pens because I
found that they bled through the paper too often and both the hard and soft tip
brushes aren't the most intuitive to control. This is it. The Fude Touch pens
are flexible without being too flexible and I didn't have the issue with it
bleeding through paper. It does bleed a tiny bit in super thin paper like mead
spiral notebooks, but if I work pretty quickly, I can still use them without too
much of an issue when taking notes for school. These are an absolute must!"
lvulpal,"August 31, 2020","This pen is so flexible, much more than the hard Tombow fudenosuke brush oen"

black ink that does not bleed"

jenny01.yang,"July 22, 2019","Best purchase ever! (so far haha)After hearing logoscalligraphy recommending this, I really really wanted to try
this as my first formal calligraphy purchase, and it didn't disappoint! Keep in
mind, I used pencils and crayola markers before this. I did try using the sakura
one, but it frayed pretty easily. So far, this guy hasn't frayed yet and I've
used it quite extensively over two weeks. The ink is pretty juicy so make sure
the paper can hold up to it. Recycled paper and index cards does have a bleeding
tendency so try to stay away from that. Make sure you don't have a plentiful
water source nearby as the ink is water-soluble. Love love love this purchase!"
taxicabnumber1729,"July 7, 2019","If I could give this pen more than five stars, I would. The ink is a strong,
rich black, and the style of the brush tip makes it SUPER easy for even
beginners to have a semi-competent calligraphy. My only concern is that the pen
may dry out quickly, as certain strokes look 'drier'. I love the width of the
pen, the feel, and everything about it!"

minimal pressure, great for many brush lettering styles."
sydney,"January 18, 2019","The ink has a bit of this effect where the ink seeps into the paper and the
edges of your words look a little, I guess you could call it, splotchy. However,
you can barely see this. The ink is a bold color and is good quality, and it was
perfect for me because I prefer hard tip. I can see why it is studyquill's
favorite!"
ayamicv,"January 17, 2019","Second purchase, perfecto for small caligraphy!"
isaiah,"January 5, 2019","Great for beginners! It has a rich dark black that the tombow fudenosuke doesn't

frey easily, Would 100% reccomend for beginners."

colors, which is great if you like to vary your calligraphy. "
slackerpete,"September 14, 2018","It's a good pen and it's great to use, but it looses points for not being

lprowell730,"September 3, 2018","I bought this pen because I really wanted a small tip brush pen for my note
headers, as well as a good starter pen for hand lettering. I have never been
disappointed with pentel products, and this was no exception. The brush is
small, and is subsequently stiffer than normal brush pens. But the pen does not
lack in line variation when you are writing, and it is easy to manipulate the
pressure you exert on the pen. I write with a very heavy hand, and have not
warped the tip to the point where it will not bounce back. I also have had very
few problems with my hand letters while using this pen. As long as you write
slowly, you will be able to have neat and crisp lines and letters!"
Bio student,"August 31, 2018","It's a super nice pen, but i'd have to say i prefer the Tombow Dual brush pen. I

jorgarr,"July 8, 2017","Super clean and super smooth lines. It's a felt tip brush pen so it's incredibly
friendly for beginners. Not waterproof but it can resist a little bit of stray
waterbrush strokes (water droplets are another story). Great for most kinds of
calligraphy, but is probably not the best if you're looking to do Copperplate
since its finest line isn't the finest you can get out of felt tip brush pens."

flexibility and stiffness which allow an immense variety of controllable line
width.So glad JetPens carries them, because I can't find them anywhere else!If you want to see what I'm doing with them, check out my daily editorial

jmullins,"September 13, 2016","Great pen for sketching...BUT, why would you use this pen, when you could get a
zebra brush or tombow that are waterproof?  This pen is not. Not sure why
companies go through the trouble of making pens like this, the Pentel Stylo,
Tradio and even the Papermate Flair pen without making the ink waterproof. 
Adding color to your drawings goes out the window...if you are out sketching and
it starts to sprinkle rain...just a few drops and you can kiss your drawing
goodbye.  Just my 2¢."

thirdpotato,"July 19, 2016","Best all-around brush pen for any type of artist. I love the variety it gets in
line width, and how flexible the tip is. The crisp fine tip doesn't last too
long once you break it in, especially if you're heavy handed, so buy them in
bulk if you do a lot of art. Otherwise, they're still great to have even when
broken in. You can get some really wonderful cartoony lines with it, as well as
realistic sketches. Give this brush pen a shot if you have no idea what to buy!"

lindseyloveslacquer,"June 24, 2016","Great Pen! I'm new to brush lettering and this pen was recommended by many
people! I've had great success with it and actually just ordered it in violet. 
It's been very easy to learn with. I only had one small issue....it seems to run
out of ink quickly, but for the price that's is to be expected. Also, I wanted
to say that the pen was shipped within hours and Jetpens has AWESOME customer
service!"
jefflovesbritt,"June 22, 2016","Love this brush pen! Easy to control and great for someone starting out with
brush calligraphy. Would recommend to every novice and expert"
Taryn,"June 16, 2016","As a person who has done little work with brush pen, I found this one to be
absolutely fantastic. The tip isn't TOO soft or flexible--I tend to press a
little firmly, so that was a great benefit. I think this is an excellent
'learning' brush pen. I learned a lot about technique while playing around with
this pen to get the strokes I want. My only regret is not getting a couple more!"
katie,"June 6, 2016","I love this pen! It's so smooth and provides just enough tip strength for

bratchny,"April 10, 2016","A great pen for bold sketches and writing. Not so great for fine details, as

Erynn,"March 8, 2016","Great line variation! I can easily control my lines (which is saying a lot, I'm
quite the heavy-handed person). Not too stiff but not too sensitive like my
beloved Pentel brush pen. At first I thought it was mediocre at best, but soon I
found myself reaching for it all the time! Amazing for the price, please
consider purchasing one for yourself!"
ascatherine,"February 7, 2016","Great pen.  Writes amazingly precise, has a smooth feel.  I use this not in
everyday writing but in something like a planner so that it can fit in the
squares and small spaces.  I love this pen.  Great value too, it was fairly
inexpensive. "

whether calligraphy or regular fonts. Happy with this item. "
Elaine,"October 28, 2015","The brush felt tip is just flexible enough without being too soft, so it's
possible to get very thin lines as well as thick ones. Great for lettering :D "

these to be enjoyable to work for sketching. Very nice addition to my sketch

gracesabella,"July 14, 2015","I've tried a lot of different felt-tipped brush pens, and this one is by far the
best for lettering. Great line variation, comfortable to hold, not too soft nor

lstantz,"November 14, 2014",perfect.
slipcat,"October 30, 2014","These are fun pens to have in your pen artillery.  I use them when I am just ""feeling around"" for ideas and want a pen with good ink, easy adjustment
from a fine line to a semi-thick line with ease, and allows me to draw freely
and rather quickly.   These pens hold up fairly well (especially for the price
and compared to other pens that I have tried).   The only reason I am not giving
5 stars is that if you go too fast with the pen, you will get a slightly ""grey""
line/slightly streaky.  Also, if you have a small twitch when you draw, it will
show as a ""squiggle"" on your line.  You can draw reasonably small, but not too
small as the control is not there for very small drawings. That being said, I
keep plenty of these on hand and they will remain in my collection of useful
pens.  "
Will,"October 1, 2014","This pen is very good for its low price, especially for things like loose
sketches ( i personally use it for figure drawing class! ) but one thing I do
notice is that the tip dulls notably fast, so if you need a sharp, fine line,
you're better off with a different pen. "

kkrewtea,"May 24, 2017",Best pen for learning brush calligraphy!
bunnyologist,"March 10, 2011","I use this pen all the time for crosshatching and very fine outlines. It's not
for people with heavy hands, and it's not the most durable pen for writing. Whoever rates these lowly write way too heavily and should be using a different
pen to begin with. If you're looking for fine detailing and have the gentle hand
for such details, this pen is perfect. It doesn't just ""wear out"" after 30
minutes."
aikoekadan,"February 26, 2011","I've used these pens for years and always found them to be an excellent buy. The
ink is smooth, crisp, and dark. However, if you press too hard, the tip will
push into the barrel, so these need to be used with only light pressure."
nytetyger,"September 18, 2012","I cannot say enough about the entire Sakura Micron line -- as a lefty who loves
inking my own pencilwork, I have to worry often about smearing ink and lines not
holding true. I have never had a problem with that when I use these pens. I love
the crispness of the finepoint, and how long they last. I've left them overnight
in a car in over 100 degree heat and not had them dry up. Simply said, I
consider these platinum class pens that are beyond affordable."
jonathan.amadio,"March 18, 2009","Good: Extreme precision.Great flow without being viscous.Writes well at all angles.No feathering. Possibly Bad: Barrel (underneath the cap) is slightly too narrow for my taste. I know I can
and will get used to it, but if you are used to big grips or thick writing
utensils, it will feel odd at first. This pen delivers and you can't go wrong if you need a utensil that writes
incredibly precise and glides perfectly. The only drawback is if you can't write
without using a large grip. Highly recommend."
necrocrunk,"September 19, 2016","I actually bought this to replace mine, because I used it so much it ran out. A
very small pen, good for detail work in very small areas. I use it to line my
art, and it's wonderful for doing lines on faces or hands without compromising
quality. It also does not smear or bleed, and if you take a watercolor brush to
it, or a water brush in general, it won't ruin the line. The archival ink holds
up better than most pens I own. A must have for traditional artists!"
marinacollings,"December 13, 2014","as always, a favorite forever.  I will just keep coming back to this pen.  I
like the tight lids, the comfortable shape and size of the housing and the TINY
point.  also, really and truly waterproof ink I can watercolor over the top of."

joeldhamilton,"January 9, 2021",I use this to write marginalia in the Bible and it works great. No bleedthrough.
Angelfox2000,"April 15, 2018",nice thin precise pen tip. don't press to hard or you will bend tip.
thebluekraken,"March 17, 2017","so i got this pen some time ago. pros: well it make a very fine line which is
what i wanted. flows well for fine drawing lines. its great for fine detail work
if you need crisp lines like technical pens would make without damaging the
paper, bleeding or other issues. you cant press hard with this pen though. the
tip is delicate and requires a light touch. prisma color pens of the same size
were similar but the flow of ink was a fraction heavier. the microns fine tip
was great for small fine details. cons: the tip is extremely delicate. it worked great for a couple of weeks of
work then quit. not dry. i made the mistake of drawing over my pencil work. the
graphite messed up the tip and i wasn't able to get it to write again. it can
clog, or get a little dry or other issues. requires very gentle treatment. in
spite of that ill get another because its early performance and lack of damage
to the paper or bleeding issues was worth it for me. id say if you need one, buy
two."

guitarayd,"August 15, 2019","These pens are really good for making small notes in your bible and as making
fine details in artwork using markers."
valid,"June 28, 2018","The Gold Standard in fine-line, smudge-proof writing on paper. Never
disappoints. It is my go-to when other pens aren't up to the task. Consistent,
even disbursement of ink; dries immediately. If it could write on slick
surfaces, like plastic page flags, I would never touch another pen. Alas, that's
its only drawback, but that's not really what it was designed for anyway. In a
class by itself, it is simply the best pen I've ever used on paper. A must-have
for the connoisseur and casual user alike."
Chad A,"November 25, 2014","Good pen for it's priceReally, the Micron series is worth it as long as you don't press too hard as you
write. Only other complaint I have for Microns is that the less it is held
perpendicular to the paper, the more skipping and lighter the line you will get.
I suppose this could be used to one's advantage if you want a lighter line, but
consistency is pretty important in my book. I'll have to keep trying technical
pens."
sammyuthefishy,"January 20, 2013","This pen is great! I absolutely love how tiny it is ~ Although, sometimes you can't write/draw sideways cause the bunt is straight and

juliaskinner1995,"May 3, 2022","It's good and I love the size, but the tip sometimes bends and it can be
different to get it to stay straight. I love this for doing very fine work as
sometimes my 03 is just too thick for small details. But it occasionally
struggles to get a solid line, and sometimes the tip gets stuck in bent
positions. Still a solid pen, and the tip is usually pretty easy to bend back to
its regular shape with a little pressure in the opposite direction, but it's
annoying."

tip will end up being pushed into the needle and then it's no longer functional,

April Kay,"June 21, 2018","I didn't like this pen at first because I tended to be very heavy-handed when I
was writing or drawing, and that ruins the tip of these sorts of pens (also
happened to me with Sharpie pens, embarrassingly enough). But after I made it a
point to ease up on the pressure, I discovered that I loved these pens. They're
perfect for drawing, especially the size 005 because of how fine and precise it
is, and they don't bleed when wet, which makes them great to use with
watercolors. The ink also tends to dry fairly quick too. If you're the type to
sketch out your drawings with pencil first and then trace over it with the Pigma
Micron, be careful when erasing the pencil lines. I use a Pentel Ain ""soft""
eraser and sometimes it can make the ink fade slightly. "

DiazArtist,"April 13, 2015","Micron pens are a pretty standard tool. It's great for outlining things and some
artists use it for their work because of the continuous nature of the lines.
It's also archival and waterproof. It's never been a dark black line. It's like
a faded black line so for strong blacks this is not the pen or marker you use,
but you can't tell unless you use a darker ink next to it or because the lines
when scanned up close seem to break apart which is not good for some kinds of
art reproductions."

bill,"December 6, 2010","Most overrated pen ever. I have never had these pens last more than about 30
minutes of use. My last one lasted less than that and I was being particularly
careful in using it only on smooth paper (Moleskine Cahier and Sketchbook) and
using it with a very light touch. After about 20 minutes the point receded into
the barrel to the point of being unusable. This has happened with every one of
these pens in this size - I have killed about six of these. Well, no more. If
you want a disposable pen that you will be disposing very soon then get one of
these. Or better yet, take your $2.00 and throw it in the trash right now. Same
result."
Jen S,"January 19, 2022","I have a couple of these and really liked them for a while. I wanted a brass pen
and the price is right on these compared to Kaweco's offerings. But after about
a year of use, the caps on both come lose while writing. The metal just doesn't
provide as snug a fit as a threaded or plastic snap-on cap. I thought these
would be my bulletproof, BIFL pens and they haven't lasted as long as my plastic
Kaweco sports. "
Emma,"October 16, 2020","I have officially fallen down the pocket pen rabbit hole. This is my most
expensive pen to date, and I'm not mad at it. The nib writes smooth, and it's
not too heavy for my hands which is a plus. The grip section is smaller than I
thought it would be, but it's not too uncomfortable for me for longer writing
sessions. I can't wait for all the adventures I'll have with it, even if it's
only to the couch :). "
go2mejones,"August 15, 2020","Great pen!  Compact in your pocket, feels cool and smooth in the hand due to the
brass. The patina that develops over use is very interesting too which makes it

Javier,"January 1, 2021","Perfectly nice brass pen.  Everything is as you'd expect.  Basically comes down

drawingalot,"January 11, 2023","This pen is perfect and timeless. I has a clip, it has a friction fit cap (I
hate twist caps for edc pens) it's brass, it is not too heavy, shiny: at least
after it develops lovely patina, a good smallish size and the nib is smooth.
Someone wrote that it was not 'exciting' somewhere else. This pen is there to be
a sturdy, edc pen that works rain or shine. I write with it, oddly enough I use
the ink that it comes with and ordered more. It glides nicely over Midori and
Maruman paper. It is safe to throw in a backpack or bag or purse. Also it looks
like something that Hemingway would write with.Do not get it if you don't like patina. I am the kind of person who buys white
gold because of how it looks over time--gorgeous and loved.If I could have one thing it would be that it is lighter while posted. It's
nearly over the limit of weight that I can write with. I sometimes write with it
unposted.My love of this metal pen makes me want to try another, like the kaweco AL, but
I am worried that the twist cap will drive me crazy. This is it."
rdaniels0721,"January 2, 2023","Love this pen!  It’s perfect in my TN.  The one thing I was not prepared for
is how broad the nib is.  It’s marked Fine, but I believe mine writes more
like a Broad."
ss7979,"August 17, 2020","I can’t believe it took me so long to purchase this pen. I absolutely love it.
Thanks Jetpens"
Libby2001,"November 9, 2022","I love this pen. Very smooth. Even though I prefer EF, I find this F is
excellent."
J B ,"July 1, 2022","I cannot emphasize how much this pen brings me joy.I love the nib width, the nib is smooth as butter, I can write and write with
minimal discomfort, the ink that came with the pen was really smooth and nice.
The patina started showing up in a week and a half of daily use, and the pen
already looks well worn and loved.Only setbacks are that this is a cartridge only pen, and there are no other
sizes except for fine, but I think this is the perfect pen for small jottings
and sittings or to just throw in your pocket and take with you. The diameter of
the pen also is pretty thin, and it encourages the ""death grip"" to not let it
slip, but you get used to it if you like writing with tinier pens.All in all, the pros outweigh the cons. I hope to have this pen WELL into the
future so I can pass it on to other family."
Sdilsin,"May 23, 2022","Very nice pen. Well built and balanced, not suitable for long, long writing
sessions but perfectly acceptable for journaling. This is mostly due to its
small diameter, which is really a feature on this pocket pen. I only take off a
star and I wish I could take off half a star because I feel that this pen writes
just on the dry side, even for a fine nib. Still a great investment and great
pen. I have all the travelers pen styles now and this is by far my favorite. I
love how the brass patinas. "
Libby2001,"March 6, 2022","Love this pen. Feels great in the hand, fine point is very smooth, the hole on
the top is fun. I wish extra-fine was available and would rather not have the
clip. I bought another one to keep on hand. This is a great pen.In a way, this pen is like a larger Kaweco Liliput - what the Supra was supposed
to be, but Kaweco put an odd nib on it and made it a bit too hefty."
ginger7house,"December 20, 2021",My new favorite pen. The right size and weight for my hand. I use it everyday. 
thomas.campanis,"July 22, 2021","Great Travel Pen. I have other fountain pens that I use day to day. But I keep
this with my Travelers notebook with an unloaded cartridge tucked in the barrel
so that when I do need it I can just pop the cartridge in and have a great
writing experience.I love the weight of it and unique capping design."
T4FP,"June 29, 2021","This should prolly be 4 1/2 stars only because tge pen is somewhat back heavy
depending on how you hold it but if you extend you hand more I can write a lot
longer. My nib hard starts and am currently trying to diagnoise the problem. Which sucks
because I only really got it so i can write a quick note or something...
Hopefully jet pens or travelers company can send me a replacment nib to see if
maybe it was just a faulty nib unit.I still love this pen mainly because this pen is hard to lose. The clip is so
dam good I have no fears bring it with me where ever cause I know once this is
clipped it its gonna stay( its only fallin out of my pocket while I'm sitting in
a car with my legs pressed against my chest(which is fair considering thats just
how pockets work) and its heavy enough i can hear it fall and notice its gone. I
really recommend if you have a tendency to freak pens or leave them some where
they can easily be step on.The section that actually snaps the clip on actually belongs on the nib itself.
Which means if the nib is off the pen wont click in which tells me if this thing
got dented or expanded, it doesn't rely on the barrel to keep it snaped but the
steel gaskets in side and the nib housing being intact. So I'm pretty confident
the pen will snap on and off even if this gets beat up alot.Pen was a bit scratch but tuning this pen isn't hard.Glad i got this over the liliput mainly for the price and clip. Plus I think
this looks nicer and less bougie."
aiguchi1967,"October 17, 2022",It was a gift for my beautiful half and she truly in love with this pen. Thank you very much!
miamarshie101,"September 3, 2021","Absolutely fantastic! Jetpens sell this around 3 dollars cheaper than a
different store as well. The pens glide over, and the bullet nib is a lot darker
than the highlighter, making it convenient to write on top of your highlight.
The colors are vibrant and fun and really improved the highlighting and reading
experience. "
schwarznikki,"May 23, 2021","really love these! the colors are so bold, but don't bleed. lines and markings
made by both ends are clean and nice"
onion,"July 9, 2022","i LOVE these markers! i love how much pigment they have, and the thinner end is
great for underlines and other doodles/annotations. (the thinner end of the
marker is also thin enough to comfortably use stencils with (for me, i was using
the ""Kokuyo Jibun Techo Accessory - Template (Stencil) - Plan""))i love the array of colors that's provided in this pack and i'm really glad i
went ahead with this purchase (because i was initially planning on buying a set
of stamps)but the colors of red, yellow, teal, blue, and purple are such a hit! not to
mention the design of the markers themselves are very aesthetic.weird tidbit but -- i also really like the ziplock pouch these markers come
with! it's nice to the touch and i think i'm just gonna keep them in there

reading textbooks"
Yousuf Asghar,"May 11, 2022","This pen is good, but it has some drawbacks. I bought this pen about a month
ago, and it was GREAT at first, but steadily I found some problems. The first
noticeable thing was that the ink of the pen is not that smooth. I used it for
notes one day, and I could barely move it across. From switching from Zebra mild
liners, it was a big shock to me. If the ink was smoother it would help. The
second problem I saw was the fine tip. The fine tip at the bottom is good, but
it frays. After 3 weeks of usage, I could see heavy fraying in the bottom tip. I
don’t know if that is just me, but my friends even had it happen to them too.
After 4 weeks, I could already see 2 lines when writing in my notepad.  I think
if these 2 problems were addressed, it would be a great pen."
Annie,"October 5, 2022","My fave highlighters! Fine tip delivers a crisp line, doesn't feel mushy like a
felt tip pen. However, it is very easy to accidentally smoosh that fine tip when
recapping! I've busted a couple of them and they write scratchy and mushy now.
Still love how firm and clean both ends write. Fits perfectly between the 3mm
Jibun Techo grid."
nina,"August 11, 2022","these are wonderful! they're a more compact and practical version of the
standard mark+, but they're just as wonderful!! i really love how the color of
the fine tip matches perfectly to the highlighter end, it just makes my
stationery-loving heart so happy. i can't wait to use these with my notes!"
katt,"August 4, 2022","These are amazing! Truly, perfection. I use these and the duo-tip Mark+ set for
a beautifully easy way to organize all my notes. The fact they all work so well
together and they’re minimal with each set serving 2 purposes makes for
minimal clutter. "
karenkliu9,"August 2, 2022","Would have been 5 stars but had to take it down a notch because the fine tips
are a little fragile :( I stuck it into the cap at an awkward angle and instead
of sliding back in it just split the tip. Otherwise I love these! Both the
highlighter side and pen side are great."
Winter,"August 2, 2022","I wanted to like these more than I did. It’s a great concept: pen with a
color-coordinated highlighter. But the pens just felt scratchy to me, and the
tips didn’t last long. (Full disclosure: I often write with some pressure.)
And I’ve found I’d rather have a little more contrast between what I write
and my highlighter color."
restlesscourage,"June 15, 2022",These highlighters are fantastic for studying!
johnsonnbrandy,"June 2, 2022","Amazing pens! Perfect for fast and organized note-taking! would love more
colors!make sure you highlight first, then write on top or wait a minute for the ink to
dry before highlighting over the writing. This has helped me prevent smudging! "

are great for so many uses! They don’t smear, the colors are vibrant but not
too vibrant, the fine tip is perfect for color coding notes, and the ink is
beautiful! What more could you want!? I highly recommend these for anyone!"
rlance667,"April 9, 2021","Bright colors, and perfect for highlighting notes! My favorite feature about
these highlighters is that they don't leave that dark ink smear at the beginning
or end of a highlighted line. The ink is smooth and can blend into itself,
without smudging my inks or pencil marks."
brittmai5347,"September 30, 2021","Quality: 5/5Smudge: 5/5 (doesn't smudge at all even immediately after writing/ highlighting)Overall, a great staple for your stationery bag! The tips feel really nice, the colors are vibrant, and the pen itself feels good
to write with. I love this set and I would definitely buy more if they ever
released more colors! The tip for the pen part of the marker is my favorite and
the nib feels smooth to write with. I just wouldn't press down too hard when
writing though just in case. It's really convenient if you diagram a lot for
class or if you like to mark up your papers or study materials!"
maryj_juventus,"April 28, 2021",The pen is great but the highlighter is average 
foxmo,"November 16, 2015","First off, I love this pen.  I would buy it again.  Twice.  Second off, I was
vacillating between the F and EF nib, and went with the F, even though I have
small writing and use small notebooks. I went with the Fine because some inks
look their best with a broader line.  I filled the pen with J. Herbin special edition emerald, and it was a disaster.
 It's too wet, clogged up the feed, and made my writing look clumpy.  So I began
to question the F nib.  But then I started over with Pilot Iroshizuku
shin-ryoku, and it's a pen and ink match made in heaven.  I can write my usual
small way, and the letters don't look clumpy.  Success!Third off, the pen is gorgeous.  I love how fresh the white looks.  The grip is
very comfortable.  There are little points at the bottom of the grip that took a
day to get used to.  The pen is top heavy when posted, but I don't mind it. 
It's also long enough to write with unposted.  This is my first TWSBI.  I am not new to fountain pens.  It's the nicest pen
I've ever bought.  "
Luis,"June 21, 2019","I have two TWSBI ECO pens. My blue ECO was purchased 7 months ago, the white a
few weeks later. Both have fine sized nibs. I LOVED these pens. I still want to
but they both may have become too troublesome to maintain and less dependable.The nibs in both pens have come loose twice with one falling out completely. As
I write this the nib in the white pen has come loose a third time. Each time
I've had to take apart the pen, separating and refitting the nib with it's feed.I have used the pens extensively from handwriting daily journal entries, notes
and keeping a calendar. I draw with them both almost as often throughout the
week. I love the size and feel of the ECO. You can't beat the amount of ink it
holds. The piston fill system works well. I use Noodler's Eel line of inks in
them and the flow is nice. Line variation can be achieved using different angles
however holding the pen upside down for finer lines results in inconsistent ink
flow.Again I love so much about these pens but the loose nib problem in both is
something that forces me to look for another everyday fountain pen to write and
draw."
ipya,"August 26, 2017","I got this in the mail yesterday and have been carrying it around all day. I
love the way this writes, smooth - no scratchiness. I love this pen so much that
I find myself desperately searching for things to write just so I can use it. I
couldn't have picked a better first fountain pen and am planning on buying more
so I can ink them up with other colors."
garrettarmstrong86,"August 31, 2016","This was a pleasant surprise for me. I bought it out of curiosity, as every
fountain pen enthusiast I've read praises TWSBI pens. For the price, this is an
exceptional value - the nib writes extremely smoothly, the ink capacity is huge
(and it is enjoyable to watch the ink sloosh around inside the barrel), and it
comes with a special wrench and silicon grease for maintenance when it's needed.
The pen's nib writes extremely smoothly and it has a lot of neat design touches,
such as the octagon-shaped cap to keep the pen stationary when you lay it on
your desk or table. Overall it's a great quality pen. "
j.kennedy.griffith,"June 28, 2016","I love this pen! I have been using fountain pens for about a year now. My other
pens are pilots that take cartridges. What I like about this is that I can
visually see how low the ink is without taking it apart. And it holds so much
more ink than the cartridges. I can get more writing out of one refill. I like
that the cap screws on, so it never comes apart in my bag. I was worried about
leaking if I carried it with me, and that has not happened. I obviously have not
tried ALL of the pens out there. But I am very happy with this purchase, and it
also has at least temporarily, satisfied my urge to buy more pens. "
jason n,"September 30, 2020","Just a great pen. For a relatively low price, you get a piston filler with a
huge capacity. The only downside is the lack of exchangeable nibs but if you
want that, step up to the diamond. "
martinez.nanc,"June 12, 2019","Love writing with my TWSBI ECO White Fountain Pen.  It just has style and class!
 People ask where I got my fountain pen and I tell them.  I learned to write
cursive with a fountain pen and my grandfather made fountain pens, so it's in my
blood to write with a fountain pen.  This is a fantastic product.  Nancy Martinez, M.Ed. "
jNYc,"October 23, 2018","Great pen. I’m using with de Atramentis document white ink and performs great!
I gave it 4 stars because the nib size isn’t identified on the nib. Inhave a
fine and an EF. I can’t tell them apart unless I have them both open or when I
am using it."
cathy,"September 7, 2017","TWSBI pens are always top notch. I own 4 TWSBIs - I like how they show off the
ink color. The fine nib is a little too broad, I prefer the EF nibs on my other
pens. Still a great pen, but not quite as elegant as the Diamond AL."

paige.casabona,"February 28, 2016","This is my first ""real"" fountain pen.  I love the clear body so you can see the
ink fill up and know exactly how much you have left.  It's a really pretty pen. 
It doesn't feel ""expensive"" since it's all plastic, but it definitely feels well
made.  It's easy to fill and I haven't had any problems with leaking.So far it writes really nicely.  No scratching that I've noticed.  Occasional
skipping but I'm still getting used to the fountain pen feel.  I was unsure
whether I wanted the fine or the medium, but the fine is actually quite bold (at
least with the Diamine ink I've been using).  If I was choosing again, I might
even go for the extra fine.The best thing I can say about this pen is that it makes me want to buy another!
 Definitely a good starter pen and quite nice for everyday writing too."
kccarney,"January 5, 2016","excellent design and value. Writes better than a Pelikan which costs about 10-15
times more. Great nib, great look, and very large ink reservoir. Looks fine with
blue ink in the see thru barrel. "
Christine,"July 28, 2022","A really great, reliable, cheap fountain pen. If you're looking to try out some fountain pens, but the $$$ scare you off a
bit, try first with a TWSBI ECO. They're sturdy enough to use regularly, but cheap enough that you won't have to
fling yourself off a bridge if you lose it or break it. I've been using one of
these at work every day for years. "
kait,"June 16, 2022","This pen is great. I have the diamond 580 alr and i was worried about how they
were going to make a high quality pen for half the price. However Twsbi still
managed to do so. I really like that you can post the cap and the nib is nice as
well. Keep in mind that even though the nib appears to be more like a Japanese
nib the thickness of the German nib still remains. The fine on this twsbi is
quite a bit thicker than a fine on a pilot or another pure Japanese fountain
pen. The overall feel is nice and comfortable as well. It doesn't feel cheap,
but there is a lot more plastic.  "
MORALESRV7,"May 4, 2022","Before my ECO, I had to refill my fountain pen every two weeks. Now, I can go
for 30 days without needing to refill it!"
seong.franchesca,"April 12, 2022","I bought this a while ago but only recently started using it. I used it for 1
week and then there was a problem with the nib suddenly. I tried taking it apart
and cleaning it but the nib still wouldn't produce ink from the rest of the pen.
Unfortunate, because I really liked how it wrote and there's no replacement nibs
available "

dtbetancourt,"August 2, 2020","I am entirely new to the world of fountain pens, but I cannot image a more
exhilarating and satisfying first experience than the TWSBI fine nib. Based on
several reviewers recommendations, I paired this pen with some Iroshizuku ink
and wasted no time in putting my pen to work. Beautifully boxed, the pen was very easy to add ink to. I was writing within 5
minutes and made no mess. The fine nib is the perfect size. I tend to write in a
smaller font, and the fine nib is perfectly suited to the task. I have had no
problems with blotting or running at all. So happy I cant stop writing. "
Sonny,"March 13, 2020","I have the TWSBI medium and broad and wanted to add this one to my collection.
Good but not great. There’s a bit more feedback compared to the medium nib.
While the medium TWSBI outranks the medium Pilot Metropolitan, the fine TWSBI
doesn’t fare as well in comparison with the fine Metropolitan."

hoytesther,"July 4, 2019","This is a beautiful pen! I love what it looks like inked up. I was disappointed
in the fineness of the nib though. I have the stub nib and love it so much so I

expected. It seems finer than either of my other pens (different brand) with EF
nibs."

writing with it I can acheive the thinness that I want. The Eco writes
beautifully smooth with small feedback and is very nice for speedy journaling.
If you have small hands like I do then you will definitely feel more pressure
the longer you write. All and all the Eco is a fantastic pen at this price point

Avenrox,"January 2, 2018","I received this pen as a Christmas gift, along with a bottle of Noodler's Black
ink. I absolutely adore it, this is my very first fountain pen and I can't
believe how beautifully it writes! I'm used to ballpoints and dip pens, and I
love that I can have easy writing like a regular pen, but with the elegance and
vast color options not unlike my dip pen inks. This was good to go right out of
the box, I didn't have to clean or flush or grease the piston beforehand which I
like. I would definitely recommend this to other fountain pen beginners, despite
the comparatively high price (especially for a broke college student) for the
ease of use, capacity, wealth of ink colors, and sheer cool factor."
holly,"October 26, 2017","Wow, I am loving how this pen writes. Super smooth. I'm using the J. Herbin Bleu
Ocean Ink I bought at the same time and it flows easily with no scratchy nib,
although the TWSBI Fine nib is at least as broad as my Kaweco Medium nib.The illustrations/instructions could be more clear. Yes, it shows you how to
apply the silicone grease and fill the reservoir, but do you need to apply the
grease before the first use? With every refill? There's a blurb about air
getting into the chamber after you disassemble the pen, but no information on
why you'd do that, etc... Still, the pen is easy to fill - even easier than
filling cartridges for my other fountain pens and it holds way more ink than the
cartridges also."
rmahaughn,"September 21, 2017","This is a great pen. It feels great in the hand, and the nib runs smoothly on
paper for the price. I was also surprised how sturdy it feels, while being a
budget pen, and made out of plastic. I have heard a lot of people say it is top
heavy when posted, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. I actually like the little
bit of weight that it has."
Tato Plumilla,"August 16, 2017","this is a great pen. It holds a lot of ink, it´s very smooth and the size is

Iroshizuku ""tsuki-yo"". I would highly recommend this pen and will be purchasing
other color and nib configurations in the future. "

curious when I learned that there was more than 1 way to fill a fountain pen,
and since these weren't super expensive I decided to try this one out. It's not
too heavy or too long for my small hands, and it writes very well with the Pilot
Iroshizuku ink for definite. First experiment was a success on parchment paper
and will definitely be trying out other colors. Also very appreciative of the
little tools it comes with. All in all, I'd consider this a great addition to my little pen collection and
I'm looking forward to some projects to use it for. "
Freshfry,"November 18, 2015","A great pen for the money. Easy to fill. Easy to take apart and clean like all

jantus,"July 7, 2011","This is the best pen I have ever used. I have looked at many other fine tip pens
-- gel ink, ballpoint, etc.... I\'ve the .28 Uniball, .25 Slicci, the Hi-Tec C,
and none of them have been able to write as smoothly or consistently as this
has. It does not blotch; it gives a consistent and even line. Not only is it
good for extended writing, but it\'s also been excellent for underlining in
books and editing in papers and such. I would recommend this pen far above any
others. And the best part is that it\'s a meager $ for a new pen. I\'ve spent
that on refills for pens I like less. Do yourself a favor and buy 3 or 4 of
these pens and a few different colors -- if you like fine tip pens for clean,
precise writing, then you will love this."
jimi,"December 11, 2015","NOTE: Have not used the entire ink cartridge yet, so this may change in a few
days/weeks...I have pretty bad handwriting, so I have to use thin lines of ink for my letters
to be distinguishable. So far, all my experience with .3 mm.> pens has been
good, but scratchy, and I thought I preferred that...turns out I don't. Don't get me wrong, this pen is STILL scratchy (pretty
unavoidable for a .3 mm pen) but it is by far the smoothest at this tip size
(I've used the uniball .28,.18,.38, hi tec c .25, .4 maica, and mach 2, mach 3
.4 mm, as well as some others I can't think of...). The line has YET to break out of probably 10 pages of dense notes on computer
paper. The pen is pretty comfortable for me, though the grip is large, I have long,
slender fingers, so it's a positive for me. My concern was, coming from capped pens before, that the tip wouldn't be ""snug""
in the housing when you clicked it open (which was my experience before with
cheap clickable pens; you'd pick up the pen from the last letter you wrote to
start another one, and the tip would shift in the housing a little bit causing
the line to start writing on the paper where you wouldn't expect it) but this
was not the case. The tip is very snug when out. The line is black, though can get a dark grey if you zip the line across the
page (this won't happen though, unless you're doodling). No bleed-through at all on computer paper. Clip is nice (but I don't care about that stuff).Grip COULD be better (softer) but this is still good (just standard thin layer
of smooth-ish rubber over plastic). Better than plastic though. I've written 10 pages of double-sided notes on computer paper, and I'm still at
about 2/3 left, which is pretty on-par I think with other pens. Let's hope the
tip doesn't break! (I haven't dropped it on the tip yet, but otherwise I spin it
around my finger when the tip is housed, so I think it's pretty good).Overall, my new go-to pen for note-taking/writing. "

recommendation I've gotten from JetPens.  I read all of the great reviews and
was excited to receive several of this pen in black, blue-black, and orange, but
I'm pretty disappointed in this line.  Out of 5 black pens, not a single one
gives a consistent line and they're irritatingly scratchy.   For < 0.5mm gel pens, I'll stick with my Uniball Signo DX 0.28 mm and Pentel
Slicci 0.25mm. Sorry, JetPens.  I just couldn't get into this one."
spam.blakney,"October 19, 2011","Great pen!I've tried the Hi-Tec-C and uniball signo, and this writes more consistent and
cleaner than both of these. Unlike the Hi-Tec-C, it takes no time whatsoever to
start up, and it rarely skips. I would recommend this pen to anyone who likes
thin crisp and consistent lines.  The only issue I have with this pen is the
amount of ink (which is very minimal) but at least it's cheep. I highly
recommend buying a few of these for any micro tip users. "

Francesca,"February 8, 2021","I bought the Black 0.3 and 0.4 mm after trying the Black 0.5 mm, which I like.
All these tip sizes lay down a richly saturated line which is black even in the
smaller tip sizes. The tips are not scratchy, even on slightly textured paper,
although I feel the grain of paper under the 0.3 mm tip. There is enough
difference in line width between all the tips that warrants getting one of each,
especially since I enjoy writing on small grid ruling. The pen is comfortable to
hold for long writing sessions, and the rubber section makes it easy to grip. I
don’t use the clip, but it feels sturdy, as does the click mechanism. I’m
glad I have the 0.5 mm, as the 0.7 mm might be too inky for me."
bexbennett,"August 4, 2020","I bought this for 2 reasons.  It's 0.3 and I'm working through most decently
rated finepoint pens and this one is another good fine point pen.  Secondly
would be the grip, it goes right close to the end and that's where I grip my pen
and usually get uncomfortable so I was happy to enjoy the squishy grip where I
actually grip the pen."

dorn9503,"November 12, 2015","With my tiny writing applications, this pen didn't fare as well as I expected. 
While the line size stayed relatively the same, it seemed to flow more ink when
I, as i often do, heavy handed my writing.  I was forced to adopt a blotting
procedure when taking notes on a 'semi gloss' workbook paper.  It writes well on
normal notebook paper and I was able to put 6 lines in a single standard
notebook rule space.  This pen will not make my list for potentials, but if
you're not using it on anything other than standard paper, it should be fine."

considered a downside for some is that I bought a Clip in 0.4mm to try as well,
and out of the gate I notice very little difference in the size or how they
write. However, that could change with further use. Regardless, I still love

high-clay paper, I get transfer if I quickly flip the page to continue, unless I
intentionally wait for the ink to dry. Not a concern with these quick drying

extremely delicate, and the tip breaks very easily.  I've never...really,
never....been able to use the ink reservoir to the end before it becomes
unusable.  I don't think I'm misusing the pen, but maybe I am.  If any Sarasa
enthusiasts have advice for me on the topic, I'd be very glad to hear it."
misterjuju,"February 28, 2012","Zebra's Sarasa Clip pens are always a good buy. The ink is smooth and writes
with just a tiny bit of scratching. (unless you write on quality paper, like on
any of the excellent notebooks sold here by Jetpens). And one thing I noticed is
that the retracting mechanism is kind of rattle-y when you're writing. Its more
noticeable on scratchy cheap paper. But it id not bad enough to take away a
star..I am obsessed with finding the perfect fine point gel pen, and won't rest
til I've tried one of everything on this site and others. So far, Uniball'sa
0.28 and 0.38mm gel pens are #1,then Zebra Sarasa, then Pilot Hi-tec C and

multi-color pens) and is comfortable to write with. My only issue is that some
colors seem to be more saturated than others, which is why I docked it one star."

as opaque as standard gel pens.  However, if that does not bother you, I highly
recommend Pilot Frixion pens because they erase very well, they pair well with
erasable and non-erasable highlighters, and they write smoothly.*Compatible with Pilot FriXion Pen Refills - Slim Size (0.38mm)."
cinnabunnii,"October 8, 2022","this pen is comfortable and a great substitute for a pencil when it comes to
notetaking during lectures. However, it's best to buy an extra black ink
cartridge if you live in warm climates. I tried the overnight freezer trick that
I saw in the QnA but this does not restore ink. "

AmyEN,"April 11, 2022","super easy to customize the colors, smooth motion, good clip."
Jeffery.G.Davis,"March 15, 2022","Great pen. My only issue is that frixion black is always a little lighter than
other black inks. I'm sure that is a limit of the tech though, and it's not
distractingly bad, just a little grayer. Over time, the clear grip has started to get a little bit of a dingy look. I
don't know if that is from exposure to light, or exposure to my hands (which I
think are about as clean as anyone else's, it's not as though I use this thing
right after digging holes). It's not a great look.A major point in it's favor is that it is a very sturdy body. As far as the feel
of the mechanism itself I would put it in my top couple. So many multi pens have
play in their mechanisms, but not this one. Does go through ink quite quickly, but I use it for taking notes in class and it
doesn't run out fast enough to be a problem, just faster than other multi pens. Be sure you get a sense of which ink you need for this. There are a ton of sizes
of frixion and people get it wrong a LOT. If you read reviews of the inks here
or on other sites every third review is ""DOESN'T FIT MY PEN!!!"" Well no kidding,
you bought the wrong ink. "
MiriCurls,"March 7, 2022","This thing is awesome! I like that the selectors aren’t colored & it’s 
clear, so selecting the color is easy. I do find that I have to be mindful when
using the eraser to not include the  clip in my grip. Doing that has resulted in
hearing cracking sounds coming from the pen. So, I’ve since tried to angle the
part with the clip away from my hand, only holding the pen body while erasing."
Nath,"January 23, 2022","Love the spring clip & replaceable eraser.The clear body enables to visually select the color I want to write with, which
is so much better than trying to remember which pen holds the purple refill, and
under what button color.I plan on buying more until I have enough to fit all the 0.38 FriXion colors."
Kitty,"January 3, 2022","It’s nice, but it’s not as smooth as the 0.5 frixion. Not scratchy, but just
not very smooth. Also, i wish the clickers for each refill were color coded, as
it can be hard to tell which color you are using. These work well with the Jibun
Techno."
schlenkeramy1,"December 6, 2021",Love this pen. Reliable function and so much easier than individual pens.
renee.martinez,"September 29, 2021","Very happy since I wanted to ""refill"" this with non-standard colors (of which
they sell a ton).  Last time I tried this had an opaque pen with pre-colored
""clickers"" to push out the pen.  That was awful, but I loved having the options
(I am an artist and also use color-coding in my work).  THIS was the answer (I
even got a couple to take the wide array of colors available). I am extremely
content."

cborneman,"July 31, 2010","This pen is a great brush pen, and I am pleased to add it to my collection.  I should start off by describing the way I have been using this pen. I am an
intermediate Japanese student who has been practicing the kanji to memorize
them, and since I also work with traditional Japanese calligraphy and making my
own ink, I already am aware of the pros and cons of using a (real or synthetic)
brush. So basically, I can't really review this from an artist's standpoint, and
I have no idea whether it would be useful for that purpose, though I imagine it
would. The Kuretake No. 8 writes very well, but you obviously have to remember to not
use it like you would a pen--you'll put too much pressure on it and the lines
will be sloppy. Many have complained about the Kuretake ink not being waterproof
(though it does become waterproof over the course of a few weeks), but I've
heard the carbon ink fits and is waterproof instantly or very soon after
drawing. I haven't tested those claims, and frankly this is perfect for me since
I don't do drawing with these. The ball bearing that mixes the ink is ingenious
to me.  I was impressed with the amount of control this brush has when compared to a
real calligraphy brush, and it does indeed come quite close. In fact, I've found
that since this tip is a bit smaller than the ones I've been using that I can
almost put down lines so thin it looks like handwriting (but obviously a little
thicker than a pen). This tip is essentially the same as the No. 13, and I find
it has great control when doing strokes. I really dislike the felt tip brush
pens mostly because they don't really seem to have the level of control that a
brush tip does.  I can't really touch on how well this works with other ink, but if you need to
practice writing characters like me to aid memorization, this pen is a great
choice. It really replicates the feel of a natural brush fairly well for the
money, though it still is not as controlled as a brush pen or brush with real
hair, but in this price range, I think it's a winner. I took off a bit from my
rating only because the pen appears a bit more ""disposable"" in nature than it
could, but that's really my only complaint thus far. It's functionally a great
pen and if you're on the fence, I don't think you will regret taking the plunge.
:P"
Sheryl,"August 9, 2008","The Kuretake Fountain Hair Brush Pen has functionally the same nib as the
Kuretake #13 Fountain Brush Pen. The Kuretake Fountain Hair Brush Pen is not
nearly as pretty and the plain brown plastic body is so long that posting the
cap makes the pen feel unwieldy. However, the pen's use without its cap posted
is like using the #13 pen with that pen's cap posted. If you are going for
function and not looks, then save money and buy this pen rather than the #13
pen. Both pens are very fun to use and come with cartridges of black,
non-waterproof ink, but accept the Platinum cartridges of black waterproof ink
(also sold by JetPens)."
chloe016,"April 28, 2010","So far I've only used the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen and this one, but I like this
one much better. The ink flows faster, allowing fast strokes to stay more
saturated. The tip of the pen body is more tapered, so you can comfortably hold
it further down for more precise work. Also what's cool is the Kuretake ink
cartridges have a small metal ball blocking the hole - when you snap the
cartridge into the pen, the ball is forced into the cartridge where it stays and
keeps the ink mixed up. Awesome!"
seanb_,"July 16, 2010","I just wanted to add to my earlier review favouring this brushpen over the
Pentel standard. I am not bought or a Jetpen goon, but I do not want to
misrepresent something good. Having used the Pentel more underlines my initial
impression of both having their uses, but even more I love them equally now. In
short, try both: Kuriyaki no.8 = rounded soft controllability, Pentel Standard =
rustic squared off lines and snappy elasticity."
geminica,"March 29, 2010","This pen is a joy to draw with. It's similar to the Pentel Pocket Brush, but
with a touch more responsiveness. Of all the brush pens I've tried, this one is
the most like using an actual brush."
seanb_,"March 4, 2010","I do so hope that this gets noticed in the sea of (Kuretake especially) brush
pens available, because I will need another one (or five) once mine wears out.
It's basically a long pointy and fair haired high quality synthetic brush
plugged into a well-fed pen, like a proper brush that never runs out. No squeeze
necessary. The body is very snazzy in a utilitarian functional way, it doesen't
show in the pic but it's like a slightly metallic cold brown with a subtle shift
towards red/pink. The cap has three raised ridges to stop it from rolling (nice
attention to detail). The elongated barrel is comfortable and does make it more
brushlike, a normal pen body would probably have affected its usability
negatively. It weighs next to nothing like it should. I use it for art, and
having only plugged in a Pentel Standard super fine for a short spin (with the
hideous off-blue black ink bundled with it so maybe I'm not objective) I easily
prefer this over that for my own uses which is typical fine art ink drawings -
think tapered clouds with brush cross hatching or comics/illustrations with
rustic patterns and textures. I think both have their use and I really haven't
fully evaluated the Pentel yet so dont hesitate to try either, but this is a
comparably soft (but still perky elastic) brush with which only your dexterity,
pace and handling is the limit to how fine and expressive a stroke you can make
with it. The Pentel felt more stubby. Works great with Platinum carbon ink
cartridges and like noted the flow can be everything from somewhat dry to wet
depending on how you store it, how much you lace on with it, if you shake it to
get the flow going and so on. I recommend to store it horizontally laying down."
dracotelitha,"February 9, 2016","Love love love this pen.  Just totally ace.  It has an absolutely fantastic ink
flow and the brush is very very very soft.  My brush pen before this one was a
lot harder and I burned through the ink on that one pretty quickly.  This one is
definitely retaining the ink better and I haven't had to change out the ink
cartridge yet.  10/10 am definitely buying again."
soren,"October 16, 2015","I have used this pen a lot since I bought it. The brush tip is nice and
responsive; the pen is comfortable to hold, even in my small hands (the length,
even when posted, has not been any trouble); I've only left it alone long enough
to go through the cleaning process once, and that went smoothly and without a
hitch; I have been sticking the Platinum Carbon cartridges in mine and that ink
is absolutely lovely, though the ink that comes in the pack is also a nice dark
black (I didn't test it for waterfastness though). These days, when I want to
sketch loosely and with expressiveness, I reach for this pen before any other
drawing tool."
akoszis,"June 27, 2016","This was my first time using a kuretake brush pen but I was immediately in love
with it. I've used a variety of different brush pens but this one is very
responsive and flows fantastically. I bought a converter for it so that I could
potentially fill it with a variety of the other inks I own, and I'm definitely
planning to buy more of these. "
nami,"December 14, 2014","After having had this pen for approximately three years, here are my thoughts on
how it holds up:From the beginning, the tip's loose flexibility seems to encourage expressive,
fluid drawing, rather than controlled, tight inking of pencil drawings (I think
the Pentel Pocket is better for control, as it is snappier).  The tip is shorter
than the Pentel Pocket brush's tip.  Line variability was good, though after
three years it has lost its ability to make hairline strokes, while the Pentel
Pocket brush is still going strong.  The ink included with the pen is not
waterproof, but it is compatible with the carbon black ink (and shows no sign of
ever clogging) so that is an easy fix.  While it is new this pen is great."
Robert,"July 28, 2019",Perfect. Enough said. Blows the Pentel Pocket Brush pen out of the water. 
Ugis,"February 14, 2018","The biggest problem is the design and tip construction. I liked the line
generally, it seemed to be a decent black. However, as you keep using it, if you
hold the pen close to the tip you inadvertently start disassembling the tip. The
whole front bit by the brush is just pushed on, it's not screwed or locked in
place in anyway except through friction. So after you accidentally do that once
or twice the brush starts leaking on you. It makes no sense to me how this is
supposed to work. It seems most people have had better results with it, but I
can't recommend this pen. "
Kussou,"March 14, 2021","Had my eyes on this pen for the longest, and finally got it. Lovely crisp lines,
takes some getting used to. If you're looking to go waterproof, the carbon ink
cartridges are the way to go!! Wish i could attach pictures !"
OakTree,"January 20, 2021","Warning. This pen leaks HORRIBLY. I want to like this pen, but I can't overlook
this flaw. Every time I use it, my hand is covered in ink. It leaks at the
screw-on connection point, no matter how tightly I seal it. I even bought a
second pen, and that one leaked too!! Really annoyed because now I'm stuck with
a leaking pen and its refills, which will also just leak everywhere..."
dracononmortuus,"March 7, 2020","Great, affordable fountain brush pen."
Thaddeus E,"February 24, 2020","Out of many ink filled brushes, I am just amazed at how this has held its ink.

often at all anymore) "
smallmymble,"July 10, 2019","Same thing happened to me as to user pennydox -- tip of brushpen lodged in cap
and the brush is now loose and far less precise.  Very disappointed, as not only
did I spend money on the pen, I also bought a converter to use with it and
within a few months it is no good to me."
Dan D,"June 19, 2018","I use this pen for illustration. I got the Kuretake No. 8 upon hearing that
numerous artists prefer it over the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen. I was surprised to
find that the Kuretake actually had less snap than the Pentel, and holds a
slightly deformed shape after making a stroke. I was also surprised that the
body of the pen felt a bit cheap in my fingers compared to the Pentel, although
I do like the longer barrel.That's not to say that the pen isn't good. I use it with waterproof Platinum
Carbon ink cartridges which were recommended to me over the included cartridges.
I will continue to use this pen side-by-side along with the Pentel, and I am
sure that I will eventually learn the nuances of each.One curiosity is that my pen does not have the silver band on the body near the
cap. I wonder why?"
Carollowne,"July 22, 2017","I love my other Kuretake Brush pens (13 and 40) an this is ok for quick

ms.santabarbara46,"May 9, 2022","For all the rave reviews, I had high expectations for this pen, but the ink flow
is very dry, and the brush does not lend itself to much line variety. You have
to give it more pressure to get the ink to flow.  The barrel is quite long,
which doesn't suit my use, drawing for watercolor.  Wanted to love it, but I'm
not a fan of this one.  Prefer the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen."

black as I expected, but I appreciate the refill. Great for the price too. "
brushpenaholic,"January 4, 2018","This is my all time favorite nylon brush pen. YES it wins over the Pentel pocket
in my book! It has the PERFECT thickness of a brush tip, allowing me to get
really skinny lines when need be. It doesn't have the best ink flow, so just
don't make quick lines, but at the same time, I find with any brush pen it's
better to work slowly. The ink is a beautiful dark black and is easy for me to
get a lot of line variety. I will say though, when I first bought it I tried
using it on a toned sketchbook with no luck, but on every other regular sketch
paper I've tried it's been fine. Also, the refill cartridges are super cheap!!
Definitely try this one if you're looking into using nylon bristle brush pens."
yukie25,"September 15, 2017","I like that I don't have to squeeze the barrel, like I do with the Pentel Color
Brush Pen. I'm using the Kuretake Black Ink cartridge, and it flows very well.
I've tried a couple different brush pens, and decided I'm not a fan of the
stiffer synthetic tips. This really has a great feel without the mess of having
to dip into an ink pot. It also doesn't do any weird pooling, the ink flow is
consistent. I use it for pen and ink drawings, so I don't know how well it
performs for calligraphy. "

Ashley,"July 14, 2016","This pen is excellent quality and has just the right amount of control for a
brush pen! I used a carbon ink cartridge, so I can't comment on the ink it comes

markers and other mediums I've tried it with."
queso,"August 4, 2015","This is the first hair pen I've ever used so I was very excited to use it. I
skipped the cartridges it came with and popped in a Akashiya Bamboo Brush pen
cartridge. It was tricky at first and still is. My hands are a bit shaky from the
medication I take so sometimes the lines can be a bit... strange to say the
least. When I tilt it on it's side I get a nice dry brush effect which I really
love. I was going to get the Pentel one people rave about but ended up not since
a friend told me they were sending one along with some other goodies.I had my eye on this one for a while though so I finally picked one up. It's really great. The flexibility is all there, it stays pointed, and the
amount of line width is incredible. I'm loving using it and it's become an
extremely welcome addition to my pen arsenal. My other pens are some fude brush
pens, a fine fountain pen, and a brush stroke style fountain pen from Sailor. It
fits in just right and seems to fill in any gaps I was missing.If you're looking to buy this and are wary, pick one up. For me it was
definitely worth it. All round it's a wonderful pen!"
leemoejones,"July 22, 2015","I actually bought this pen on a whim, but it turns out that it's a really great
pen! Definitely stacks up to the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen - maybe even a litter
better. It's easy to control and the brush tip is rather fine, but that doesn't
mean lack of line variation. Nice, black ink. Seems to work fine so far with my
Copics and watercolor.  I've lately been using the Akashiya Sai Outline Brush Pen, which is a great
value and a nice pen... but this one is refillable and easier to control. Better
ink, too. It takes awhile to work out a new brush pen, but I think I might be
sticking with this one for the long haul!"
dizzythesun,"January 17, 2015","This is a great brush pen for someone who writes/draws with a heavy hand, like
myself. The tip is a bit less responsive than the pentel pocket brush, which for
me is actually a perk. I have a hard time controlling the pentel-getting it to
make fine lines is near impossible with my titanic grip. The shorter tip on the
kuretake is also great for those who tend to draw smaller, also like myself. So
far I'm pretty pleased! "
lessherger,"May 30, 2012","I love this brush pen for sketching.It's size is just a tad too long to easily fit into my sketching set, so I

perfect for sketching and comes back to a nice fine point after applying a broad
swath of ink to the page.A great first brush pen that will get you addicted to the style."

DiazArtist,"March 15, 2017","I'm using the Kuretake No. 8 Brush Pen as underpainting outline brush for my
acrylic paintings. I was using disposable Pitt markers with brush tips, but they
get so dull so quickly that I wanted to find an alternative. This looks to do
the job I'm looking to do and perhaps even better since the point is a lot
sharper than the Faber Castells. I'm using Noodler's ink which is archival and
waterproof. There are a series of other colors, but I chose a nice dark brown
and from the samples they give they are not suppose to run after it's dried
which is what I need. The tip is shorter or apparently shorter than the Pentel
Pocket Brush so you feel that a little. I wonder if the more expensive No. 13 is
better. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a pen that for the most part
you won't see in the final art so this is perfect. I knocked down a star because
it is a little shorter than I wanted, but everything else is solid. The pen body
and top are pretty standard light weight. I guess having a heftier pen would
feel better for me, but maybe not to others. I suppose I can tie something or
put something inside the pen to make it heavier. I'm just happy i was able to
have the ability to use a more permanent replacement for my underpainting so I'm
happy with that. We'll see how it handles under the acrylic paint."

bratchny,"April 10, 2016","A great introduction into your foray of using a Japanese brush pen - great for
calligraphy and sketching, but also great for lineart. It does take a bit of
getting used to, as the brush has many widths - but with use it becomes easier
to control. I have used it for writing Kanji, and lineart - still getting used
to it, but it flows great, with minimal feathering. It's good that the pen comes
with 2 ink cartridges, however, the ink is not waterproof, so it doesn't play
well with watercolour paints. I recommend Platinum Carbon Ink Cartridges which
are sold at Jetpens."

works well, but unfortunately the ink doesn't stand up to my watercolors. But I
look forward to using it with colored pencil instead!"
Michael,"June 3, 2018","I originally bought a silver Rotring 600 ballpoint in Germany in 1991. I have
used it almost nonstop for 27 years. I always wanted a black one but Rotring
discontinued them and the secondary market was so expensive so I never got one.
So excited that these have been brought back and reissued!  I just received my
new black 600 today and I am so happy to report that the quality is still just
as high as the originals.  The knock is so solid and smooth with a pleasant
metallic feel to the movement.  The pen is still a solid and weighty coated
brass like the original.  The finish is impeccable.  The supplied
Rotring-branded refill writes surprisingly well, better than I remember the old
Rotring refills.  It says it is a 1.0mm ""m"" line but it seems to actually write
a little thinner than that IMO.  It is quite smooth with no blobbing or poor
""ballpoint"" performance yet.  I am overjoyed to have a new black one to
complement by 27-year-old silver 600.  These pens will last a lifetime or
longer.  If you don't have one, get one."
LouE,"July 8, 2018","Really love the feel of this pen. The grip and weight are perfect for me, like
actually perfect by far my favorite of any pen or pencil I have. I don't really
care about how pens click so long as they don't break so I don't have anything
to really comment on about that. There is one major issue tough. The tip of the pen is very loose around the ink
cartridge. I've tried a few refills and the problem is the same for all of them,
but it leads to the pen making a pretty loud metallic clink when writing. It
also leads to the tip of the pen wiggling a very noticeable amount when writing.
I ended up wrapping a strip of scotch tape around the very end of the refill and
it tightens the fit around the ink cartridge so there is only a tiny tiny bit of
looseness now. Making the pen by far my favorite. 4 star review, because without the tape it's probably a 2 star pen. I'd take a
BIC over how loose and loud the pen was at first. With the tape though it's far
and away my favorite pen, and so long as it doesn't break I'm assuming will stay
there. I'm also contacting the Rotring just to see how they respond. If customer
service is either great or terrible I'll update the review. "
aaroncastorac,"May 8, 2019","This is a great pen. I love the design of it, it's surprising heft despite being
so small, the strong clip it has, and the satisfying click it makes that's just
enough audible feedback without being disruptive. The knurled grip is a pleasure
to use, but beware that it can get uncomfortable after a while if you tend to
hold your pen tightly. I don't think this warrants taking a star off though.Where I do have to take off a star is the ink refill it comes with. I've never
been a fan of thicker tipped pens, mostly because I'm left-handed but also
because I tend to write rather small. I didn't use the refill too much because
of this and switched to an Ohto Flash Dry Refill (lefties especially should
check that one out) but from my experience with it, I wasn't very impressed. If
the pen could have come with it in a .5mm or even .7 I might have tried it out
for longer, but 1.0 is just too bold for me."
soumithrib,"December 31, 2020","The Rotring 600 can easily be turned into a 5-star pen, but it comes with three
notable quality issues that make it a 4-star pen out of the box.First, the refill that comes in this pen isn't commensurate with the price —
it writes like a disposable bic pen. Thankfully, the Rotring 600 takes
Parker-style G2 refills, of which there are many available on this site.Second, the refill itself wobbles slightly inside the pen. Although subtle, the
wobble was enough to annoy me while writing. Again, this issue can easily be
fixed, this time by putting a piece of thin tape on the thickest part of the
refill.Finally, the paint on this pen is soft. The finish is, in fact, so soft that
opening its box can scrape paint off. This pen is packaged in a triangular box
with an outer sliding cover, revealing the pen. The material on the inside of
this cover is a rough cardboard, which removed the finish off the grip of my pen
as I slid it off, leaving an unseemly line with brass showing in some places.
While this doesn't bother me too much as Rotrings tend to lose their finish on
the grip over time, this may be a deal-breaker for people who like to keep their
pens in pristine condition.Overall, after replacing the refill and adding some tape, I really like this
pen, but be aware of the caveats above."
mbonneau,"November 24, 2020","Love this pen! I tend to prefer smaller grip pens and finer tips, and after
reading several reviews of the 600 I decided to buy one for myself. I ordered a
bunch of refills for it, including Parker, Fisher, and Uni-ball and have settled
on the Jetstream SXR-600-05 as the perfect refill for my preferences. I found
the .38mm too scratchy, the Fisher not dark enough, the factory 1mm too broad
for me, and the Parker Quinkflow Fine was second only to the Jetstream .5mm.
It's a great pen, excellent grip section, well-built, attractive, seems like it
will last forever. "

for himself and durable. Now he doesn't go to work without it. He loves it!"
LancashireHotPot,"July 11, 2019","This has a nice weight and solidity, but what's special about it is the knurled
grip. It pretty much glues itself to your fingers. I pack mine for international
flights: when the plane is descending while bouncing around in the air, this pen
is solidly in my hand while I fill out the Customs declaration. If I leave it on
the tray table, the hexagonal barrel won't roll off. It takes a Parker-style refill, so it is easy to upgrade it to gel ink."
mikefromsac,"June 27, 2018","A bit thin for my current favorite size, but matches my 600 Pencil perfectly and
I swapped a Parker Medium (.7) Gel Refill in and it's a very nice pen."
l.shaiming,"September 18, 2019",Great pen very smooth and love the metallic feel and weight.
sandovalarnold79,"April 10, 2019","The pen is great, I like the metal body, it means it’ll last longer, the paint
has chipped in different spots but I don’t use a pen case or something to
protect it so I don’t care about that, if you have the money for a pricey pen
like this I’d buy it, refills are easy to find. The gel refills do run out
faster tho. "
joshuasabourin,"September 10, 2018","I love the weight and stability of this pen. There's a metallic sliding noise
when you click the pen, but I kind of like it. "
ddgriff75,"July 25, 2018","Nice weight and great feel! I work retail and I get at least 2 to 3 compliments
a day on this pen from customers using it. I'm usually writing ""jetpens.com"" on
the receipt so they can get their own!! Love it! "
Derick Hostetler,"July 5, 2018","Really like the feel and size of this pen. It is very well built with just
enough heft to make you know you're writing with a nice pen. Only grip at this
point is that when the click is released quickly, the next time you go to press
it the button is catching on something and has to sort of break through it
before the click. It is a small catch but enough to notice every time. Hopefully
after a bit of use whatever is catching will wear down."
rorythegreat01,"July 8, 2022","Love the the weight and the ergonomics of this ballpoint pen. It feels very
secure and does not make my hand cramp at all. I also have the Rotring 600 0.5mm
drafting pencil which feels exactly the same to this pen. The only reason why
I'm not giving 5 stars is because the ink cartridge that came with mine seems to
be running out of ink already and I will have to buy some new refill cartridges.
Overall, I would highly recommend this one and the 600 drafting pencil as well. "

markmeadows,"April 16, 2022","When was the last time you were pleasantly surprised when your expectations were
exceeded? This is a great quality pen with a solid feel.Speaking from experience, be careful if someone wants to borrow this because you
may have trouble getting it back. That's why I bought a second one as a backup.When paired with the Uni SXR-600 Jetstream Parker-style refill, this is an
unbeatable combination. This proves a law of the universe that you get what you
pay for. Kudos to JetPens for their superb customer service."

ntheins,"February 11, 2021","This is a classic pen and mechanical pencil and for good reason. The feel in the
hand is very precise, the grip is strong and durable, and the click is very
satisfying. The ballpoint ink that came with the pen is also nice. I've chosen
to keep using ballpoints in this pen for things like writing on receipts where
gels fall short."
Clarence Laboranti,"January 30, 2021","The pen itself is solid, well weighted, and very comfotable to hold, doodle and
write with, as I prefer smaller diameter pens. It does feel it'll last a life
time. The included ballpoint cartrige is better than I expected. considering the
reviews. It writes like regular ballpoint pen though, so I'm happy I also
ordered a couple of Ohto flash dry  gel ink cartriges along to swipe and test.
For the nitpickers, there are some things that show lack of attention to detail,
such as the embossed rOtring logo not centered on the clip, and the rOtring
stamped name on the barrel is closer to a tomatoe red, while the red ring is a
pure red. The clicker at the back feels a bit scratchy, and like if it needed
some grease, but it actuates very well. It looks almost identical to my 0,5 mm
600 series Rotring mechanical pencil I've owned since years ago, but these
little details make this pen feel like production tolerances and general
precision has slightly declined.Fortunately I didn't have the issue where the cartridge tip would wobble and
make this ticking sound upon pressing to the paper. Neither with the original
nor the Ohto cartridge this happens. Other than the nitpicking, The pen is actually a great buy and I'm happy to own
it."

Stephen,"February 7, 2021","I loved this pen so much. It looks great, feels great, writes great. However,
there is one critical flaw. The weight distribution is such that if you
accidentally drop this pen, it will always fall tip first. This causes the metal
barrel to become slightly warped. Because its metal, the warped barrel will
inhibit you from clicking the pen open and closed.I really loved this pen, but this unfortunate flaw made this pen completely
worthless to me after 2 months of use. I have even tried fixing the warped
barrel with pliers, but once it's been warped, it never functions the same way
again."

ADR in NY,"December 22, 2018","I like its weight, simplicity of design, and black matte look. I prefer a smooth
textured pen rather than the slightly gritty feel of this pen. I would've liked
more diameter width, so its grip would be more comfortable. Is it worth its
price? Depends on who you're asking or who you're giving it to. Me personally, I
enjoy using more executive looking pens, one with a look of sophistication. I
would buy this pen as a gift for a blue collar worker; it's built to take a
beating and looks industrious. However, as blue collar work is dominated by men
(bigger hands), this pen is on the slender side and may not grip comfortably for
many. I find its cartridge to contain substandard ink; I would swap it out with
a Parker Quink gel refill. A good ink can make a world of difference. "
Mister Kraft,"January 12, 2019","This is a review of my initial impressions. After a longer period of use I will
review this again.NOTE: The EDC version of this pen is the newest version as of writing (January
2019). The description here on Jet Pens does not say this. There are small
differences but it's worth noting.\\\\It is worth saying that reviews are subjective. For my use case I am generally
satisfied with this pen. The build quality is excellent and the pen functions
very well. I was worried it would be too large but it's actually smaller than I
had imagined. The pen writes best in my hand when the cap is posted. Physically
it feels quite solid and I love that the clip is for real and allows for
adjustment if over time it folds outward. Many pens fail for me at this clip
point. In this design one can remove the clip and bend the titanium, or replace
the clip.I find that the grip is comfortable, even though I had read some people didn't
like the threading against their fingers. Not a problem. I'd like to feel the
stonewashed finish, which I had avoided as I imagined it would be uncomfortable.
Now I wonder... This pen has taken refills that were quite good and made them excellent. They
are held stiffly in the collet and make for a tool that doesn't let the refills
rock or move around.Room for improvement:It's not encouraging that there are so many O-rings in the exterior and in the
assembly in general. Time will tell about how these perform after taking a
beating. There is a gritty feeling and sound in the rotation of the front end that
expands and contracts the collet. Others have noted this in reviews. I wonder
about this, why it's happening and what this will mean for long-term
performance."
bg124c41,"December 1, 2018","BIGiDESIGN has a real winner in this EDC version. Even if you're not a sucker
for marketing hype like ""EDC"" and ""tactical"" you will almost certainly like the
fact that there is more a way to use virtually every refill that you bought for
a pen that you can no longer remember. Or find. My desk drawer is littered with
those refills, some tiny, bought for a multi-color pen that no longer works, to
a bunch of erasable Frixions in various colors. Whether I will actually swap
those refills out to suit my mood or just use them up one at a time is yet to be
seen, but I have indeed carried this pen every day since it arrived. It's not
cheap, but neither were all those refills, at least in the aggregate. Why the
missing star? The post end of the barrel is supposed to unscrew, both to
lengthen the barrel to accommodate a longer refill and to permit the replacement
of one refill with another. That but is screwed in too tightly. Use padded
pliers or regular pliers plus scratch protection for the metal to loosen it the
first time if necessary. Or develop a superhuman opposable thumb.. "
Katie,"January 23, 2021","I love this pen. I ordered a bunch of refills along with my order and I have so
much fun trying new refills in my pen. In my experience, there is no tip wobble
because you can secure the tip of the pen by twisting the grip. The pen can be
short or long depending on the length of your refill. I find the balance and
grip of the pen very comfortable for writing and drawing. I am using the
""Uni-ball Signo UMR-1 Gel Pen Refill - 0.38 mm - Blue Black"" right now and I am
loving the writing experience. There are a few cons, however. When I first got my pen it was covered in sticky
oil/grease that was left over from the machining process. Not just the threads,
but the entire length of the pen. I had to gently wipe the surface with a
slightly damp soapy paper towel many times. It was honestly really difficult to
get it off and made me feel negatively about the pen at first. Also, the surface
of the pen was not perfectly smooth, there were a few very minor scuffs. For
these reasons I would probably not consider giving this pen as a gift.This is a truly unique pen and I don't think I'll get tired of switching out the
refills. I think the price is a little high, but I haven't seen another pen like
it on the market. I'm really glad that I bought this pen."
rlarnold90,"May 15, 2021","Found my solution to keeping various empty pen cases to match the various

weighty but comfortable weighty. "
AndrewYu,"October 28, 2021","Review is difficult because the colette design with support for every refill I
wish for rates it 10 stars. I do not believe there is any other pen that have
this feature. While the build feel sturdy enough, the ""machining"" is not what I
envision a ""luxury pen"" to have. The threading for the cap feel ""scratchy"" - the
cap does not come off and screw back on without this ""icky"" feeling, as if the
machining is just slightly off. Seeing how the pen without the cap attached to
end is pretty small, removing and putting cap back on grates on my nerves. I've
gone to not putting cap back on - hope the gel ink does not dry out. Eventually,
I think I will be refilling with that pressurized space pen gel and sticking it
into a go-pack. Maybe I will try their ""clicky"" model."
danhirshbein,"January 14, 2021","Beautiful machine work; all the threads are smooth and clean. There's a lovely
heft to it that makes writing with it simply divine."
punned,"July 23, 2020","My pen arrived quickly. It is truly cool to be able to change the personality of
this pen by simply loading it with a different refill. It is very comfortable to
hold and write with, no matter what refill is in the pen. I love the tightness
of the clip and the fact that if needed, the clip can be adjusted. I also like
the manner in which the cap screws on to cover the tip or to post on the pen. "

bg,"December 28, 2018","This pen is everything it's claimed to be. I suppose it might be called the
third generation of this idea, and I've purchased all 3. What makes this one
special is that it presumably can use any of nearly 800 refills but that it
loads easier than either of its predecessors. I use it with a fineliner fiber
tip and that tip stays moist and ready to write. It's great that the length
adjusts  to accommodate a longer refill. One sort of caveat: The back end does
unscrew, but mine was so tight when I first tried to turn it that I was forced
to use pliers. Also, and I take full responsibility for this, it's possible to
think you've tightened the cap sufficiently and have the body of the pen end up
in the bottom of a shirt pocket. I know this from experience. Had the refill
been anything but fiber, I might not have had to throw away one of my favorite
dress shirts. But I still carry the pen every day, so its name could not be more
accurate."

it won't hold a refill now.  I don't recommend it.  Save your money.  "
afnan.s,"August 5, 2014","Right after unpacking the highlighters, I had a bit of a scare!Three of the pens had white nibs and the rest had extra faded ink! And no matter
how much I shake them and try to write with them they did not apply any color.
At first I thought they were dried out but the nib was wet with ink only it was
transparent. Then I remembered the fact that frixion ink fades with heat and can
be restored when subjected to extreme low heat (As per the description above).So, I left the pens in the freezer, took them out after about 10 minutes, left
them to thaw then tried them again and they worked perfectly fine! So, definitely be wary of that if you place your order during the summer ;)After solving the problem, the highlighters are very delightful change from the
usual strong colors and they erase very well. The colors are still too faded for
my liking but definitely usable. Overall, a nice product."
gaara_711141,"September 25, 2014","I always had problems skimming my text books after highlighting and with how
light the colors are it's easy,  even without erasing anything. The colors are by no means dim though. They are  colorful and attention getting
but not bright and blinding.  I love these highlighters and won't buy any hang
else.  :) "
April Kay,"July 20, 2014","These are by far the best highlighters I've ever owned. I use highlighters for a
lot of planning and outlining, so I like to have a good selection of colors, and
one of the biggest problems I have with most, is that once you get past yellow,
the other colors can get really dark and hard to read through. These soft colors
are a godsend, for real -- they're so subtle and so light, but it's still enough
color to make it pop on the page.  And the erasers actually work! I was a little skeptical about them at first, and
they weren't at all a major selling point for me, but of course, I had to try
them when they got here. And they erase the highlighter ink really easily! The
only thing is that you have to wait for the ink to completely dry, or else the
eraser might smudge it up a little.  I had an initial moment of worry when I first used one of the highlighters,
because the point felt dry and stiff, but that was just because it was brand
new, of course -- they work like a dream now. Really pleased with this purchase.
"
xenon,"June 28, 2018","These are really good highlighters, but, with one downside. If there are any
classes you have where you have to highlight more than once a week, you will be
dissapointed, as the highlighters you use for those classes will run out of ink
really quickly."
AliceW,"December 13, 2019","Initially I loved the pastel colors of these but I found that each time I
repurchase I like these less. Yes, the colors are very mild and light but they
dry out incredibly fast. "
LavenderMintRose,"February 21, 2016","These take quite a while to dry, and can't be erased until they're dry, so that

getting several other colors in addition to this set."
good noodle,"January 2, 2020","Listen to me. Before purchasing these, I did... an EMBARRASSING amount of
research about highlighters. Take it from me, an
internet/japanese-stationary-nerd: there are no better highlighters. The pastel
ones are too light IMO, and the regular ones are so bright and inky they bleed
through the page and are just obnoxious to look at. The eraser works super well,
the colors don't bleed through even the thinnest paper. I have had these for
only a day and I already am going to buy a second pack as a backup because I'm
finding that I'm using them for literally everything.I bought these to use with my Jibun Techo planner based on the Jibun Techo
lineup video. I am super happy with them, and they work really well with the
planner. No color bleed, great colors, but not over the top. "

fleader,"September 14, 2021","These pens ran out very quickly for me, which is why i am giving them only three
stars. They have the same advantages and disadvantages as all frixion pens,
namely you have to be careful about leaving your project in a hot car or sitting
a hot beverage on top of it. Another drawback is they leave a powdery residue
that slightly dims the highlighted text. Not a huge issue but slightly annoying.
I also found the yellow too light to be useful."
abena,"April 9, 2021","These highlighters are okay. It highlights like any other regular highlighter.

good when I used it."

princessunikitty18,"February 7, 2019","My issue with this highlighter is that it creates a film of whatever color your
using over the words. So instead of having black ink with pink highlight, it
becomes grey ink with a pink highlight. But you can't really highlight the area
before you write if you use a gel pen because you get alot of railroading.

are very pretty."

these pens. Also, when it has the eco symbol, does this mean I can dispose of it in the
recycling bin?It's a shame they are not refillable, at the rate I'm going through them I'm

use them to highlight things in textbooks or normal books when I do language
study, and they work really well even with the super thin paper in my books in
Japanese. Definitely my preferred brand of highlighters.I like this soft color set, especially with thin paper or when the highlighting
would just overpower the text and not make it clearer. These might be my
preferred colors for highlighting."

Shou,"April 26, 2021","These are such a cool addition to all the paper I own.I can still sort of see where I wrote or highlighted something after I've erased
it, but it's not obvious at all, unless you're actually looking for it.A needle in a haystack, if you will."
Mason,"April 22, 2021","I like these highlighters,They erase nicely, and are easy to use.I would say the tip is about 3mm to 4mm wide.They cause my Pilot G-2 pens to smear when highlighting on them, so that is a
negative, but expected.Another negative is they are more pastel then I like, but that is personal
preference and I can not hold it against the product,"
Maria Jose Quintero,"April 4, 2021","Hermosos, pasteles y muy confiables. ¡Me encantaron!"
sarah,"March 9, 2021","Pretty disappointed with these highlighters. The colors are a bit more bold than
I expected for a ""Light Soft Color"" set. __The biggest issue though is that
after highlighting and erasing, I was not able to write back over that spot with
a gel pen!!__ This happened in my Rhodiarama (with Clairfontaine paper). It was
slightly better on lower quality recycled paper. If your biggest need in a
highlighter is the ability to erase it, they do work. Other than that they're
not great highlighters. "
evaifarah,"March 8, 2021","These highlighters are awesome! I love the colors and that I can keep things
neater with the erasable component. Just be careful to allow the ink to dry
before erasing, especially with thinner paper."
gracewatts95,"March 6, 2021","If you want cute easy on the eyes highlighter these are for you! I love pastel
colors but especially for highlighter because the regular yellow highlighter are
to bright and distracting to me. But these highlighter are truly the perfect
colors. Also the friction eraser is super useful for my highlighting in my bible
when I make a mistake and doesn’t bleed through the pages. Absolutely perfect
highlighter, I can’t go back to another brand or colors. "
nanu,"March 4, 2021","I love these highlighters! They are convenient and help me in my studies. The
fact that they are erasable makes them such a joy to use! "
lizb325,"February 24, 2021",Beautiful color and I love that it's erasable. 
nakao10akemi,"February 12, 2021",Very satisfied with these. They are really cute
Elegy Rivers,"February 7, 2021","Lovely colors, but unfortunately my gel pens (0.4mm Pilot Hi-Tec-C and 0.4
Pentel EnerGel Clena) were smeared even after waiting hours for the ink to dry. 
However, I was using a relatively smooth variety of paper (fountain-pen-friendly
Rhodia), so that may have been the issue.  :-/A pretty good find, especially if you're someone who second-guesses your
highlighting!"
Alex,"January 21, 2021","Love these highlighters. The pastel colors are so nice to look at, and the ink
didn't bleed through my thin textbook/notebook pages! My favorites are the blue
and purple.One thing I didn't like was that the eraser would smudge text when I needed to
erase highlights in my textbooks. For that reason, I rarely used the erasers on
these. They also run out of ink pretty quickly, so unless you're willing to buy
more within a few months, they're a tad bit impractical."
Lisa N Chilelli,"January 17, 2021",Great
ADR in NY,"November 15, 2020","Because of eyesight issues, I find the orange and yellow useless; the other
colors I see fine. I do like that they aren't so ""juicy"" that they leave a large
inky blotch at the end of the line like you find with other highlighters. I also
like the Japanese characters on the barrel. While I cannot read Japanese, it
gives the pen a more ""unique"" look and feel. It also kind of makes me want to
learn Japanese, at least the alphabets, if one can call them that. I don't like
knowing that the ink may fade away with heat. I guess I could live with the
possibility more so than if it were actual writing that disappeared. I'm aware
that writing/highlighting will reappear with a lower temperature at a certain
degree; I would just prefer not to have to go through the effort."
julia665,"November 10, 2020","Do not pair well with pilot frixion pens.I love their pens from the same collection since they make fixing mistakes and
typos a breeze. I thought these would pair really well with them as they are
from the same collection and manufacturer, however whenever I use these to
highlight a text written with frixion pens, the ink underneath starts to bleed a
lot. Same happened with my other gel pens. They also take incredibly long to
dry. I like the idea behind these, but their performance missed the mark for me.
On a good note, the colors are very easy on the eye, and they work well with
ball-point pens."

holleylafever,"October 12, 2020","Love that these erase and leave no color residue behind. The highlight dries a
bit chalky looking, but it doesn't impede reading."
evancastellanos7,"September 25, 2020","I was not satisfied. These highlighters are proficient in color bleed. The ink
off my papers would smear when I started highlighting and when I would use the
eraser for them it would tear or exfoliate my paper so that words would scratch
off. When I did erase, it would erase the highlighter (and my words) but also
left the huge black smear all over my papers from color bleed. Thank you. I
don’t like these highlighters"
trhunter79,"September 16, 2020","Great highlighters, the erasable feature really works."
Liberty,"September 6, 2020","Thermal sensitive cases it to disappear when rubbed with the 'eraser' but
unfortunately, that is not the only thing that causes the ink to disappear. Heat
also causes the ink to disappear.After some time, like a year and a half I decided to use these highlighter
again. I only used them once or twice before and for some colors, not at all.
When I tried to use them, there was no pigment. It was like my highlighter was
made out of water.I think I put them in some hot area which caused the ink to disappear. I live in
Southern California and it's 114 degrees right now so that is highly possible."
horrorrealm4,"August 20, 2020","Very colorful lead, works great."

luvableeyore,"March 20, 2020","These highlights are great. I'm always making mistakes and it great to just
erase them."
lllukowski,"March 19, 2020",Does exactly what it says. Love these. 
amoyersinaustin,"February 28, 2020","I love the pale colors of these, but when I use them to highlight writing with
Frixion erasable pens the pen ink fades. They are best used to highlight regular
ink or used for color blocking."
conniecox42,"February 24, 2020",Work well I’m my Bible.
pinkprincess8868,"February 19, 2020","These colors are really pretty if your looking for a couple lighter shades. I
use them with books in case I want to erase mistakes or turn it back into
someone. The one problem I have with these is, on book or textured paper, it
turns a little opaque making the print underneath a little foggy. It’s not
huge but is something I would look out for if that bugs you. Overall, I love the
colors and I use them quite often in school!"
animekiller045,"February 4, 2020","These are honestly the coolest highlighters I've ever owned and the colors are
beautiful and erase like a dream "
jakki.andersen,"January 17, 2020","These erase as well as can be expected, but smear most things i regularly use
for writing. I've pretty much stopped erasing with these at this point, but
still use them as regular highlighters."

laura.n.alarcon,"November 29, 2019","Perfect for color coding notes and for making boring textbook study time more
intriguing"
hmwm,"November 28, 2019","I love the Frixion line. The highlighters are so handy for color coding my
planner... especially since they are erasable in case of schedule changes. I use
them with the Frixion Ball Slim (which will have slight smudging) in a Jibun
Techo Biz."
ellekay,"November 23, 2019","I love the idea of eraseable highlighters (no more guilt in highlighting that
book you just bought!) and I think the soft colors in this set are the most
convenient. I’ve never had a thing for dark highlighters, and the colors in
the light pack are plenty pigmented time do the job without distracting you from
the actual important text you’re trying to emphasize."
sharri.zink,"November 11, 2019","I love these highlighters! Their color is just soft enough to emphasize what's
important and the ink doesn't bleed through the paper."
nathalia.gomes.rodrigues4,"September 2, 2019",AMAZINGGG COLORS and you can double coat it that it doesn’t rip the paper 
mirra4474,"August 25, 2019","The colours are pretty but a bit dull. Probably due to the slightly dryer
consistency as compared to some other highlighters."

kc.fairchild,"May 16, 2019","Absolutely love these. I don't use the bright neon highlighters any more unless
I need to have more options than just the ones in this pack (a light and a dark
pink for example). Love these so much I now have a pack for home and a pack for
work so I don't have to carry them back and forth."
Beginner At Things,"May 16, 2019","I was really hyped up after seeing that they were erasable highlighters! I
couldn't believe it. Unfortunately, my expectations were too high. I was expecting to use these highlighters for reading as I do a lot of analysis
on books and need to keep track of everything. So, I started on The Lord of the
Flies and I especially used one highlighter (purple). By chapter 9, I realized
how much the color had faded. The color became so light and it was hard to see.
So, I do not recommend this product if you intending for heavy use. Also, you
cannot actually use the ""erasable"" quality of the highlighters on regular books.
You can basically only use this on textbooks and blank white papers.All in all, they didn't fulfill my purpose and I wasn't satisfied. I will still
keep using them until they all lose their colors though. "
Anonymous,"May 16, 2019","These highlighters are not my favorite, but they still have a lovely pastel
shade that is easy to read on the eyes. Maybe it has something to do with the
erasable ink formula, but when I highlight with these, the ink leaves a cloudy
residue over the marked areas. You can see that the print sort of fades and so
text that was once black turns slightly more pale as the ink dries. I do not
have this problem with other highlighters."
whitley.brown,"April 29, 2019",Never received. Tried to contact. No one ever returned my message. 
Ickabod,"April 29, 2019","Beautiful colors, but I don't think I'll order these again. I was going to use
them for under sketches and color pops in my sketchbook, but these don't play
well with ink. Inking over them makes certain inks more smear prone, and
coloring over ink puts a weird film over the lines. I might actually just use
these as their intended purpose, as highlighters in my work planner."
nyasko,"April 2, 2019",Frixion pens work.

ordering more."
hbutler513,"November 17, 2018","Pros:The colors look greatThe erasers really workCons:They tend to dull out the words you're highlighting. This is especially bad if
you're highlighting over pencil. They're a little scratchy if you don't press down hard enough They always make pen bleed, even if you let the pen dry completely before
highlighting. I think this is just for roller ball/ gel/ felt tip. Ballpoint
would probably be fine. "
hlsquid,"October 22, 2018","I loved them so much my students stole them from me! These are amazing and I
will get more soon!"
osbole01,"October 17, 2018","I like the colors very much BUT: if I’m highlighting notes taken with a pen,
they sort of change the color of the writing and give it this strange white
cast. Almost as if there is white pigment in these highlighters? Not super into
these."
AlltheColors,"October 3, 2018",These are my favorites for paperback books! Highly recommend. 
cappi1223,"September 19, 2018","I like that they are erasable, but I think I would still go back to the
mildliners because of how smoothly the perform. The FriXions don't run over the
page as smoothly as I had hoped."
melaniebeisch,"August 24, 2018",Beautiful colors!
2nivlum32,"August 23, 2018","The concept of these are cool, and they do erase as they claim. I use them in my
planner, along with a Frixion pen, and when these are used over the Frixion pen,
they kind of dull the pen writing...almost as if it begins to disintegrate it. I
don’t think this would be a problem used over top of any other inks though. The colors are pastel, but not necessarily light. To me, they’re more like
discolored shades of the colors they’re supposed to be. I use a color coding
system in my planner and should have probably gone with the brighter set of
markers. They aren’t very “juicy,” so if you don’t like a more dry feeling marker
to use, you may not be pleased with these. But those are personal complaints about these. I still use them anyway because
I’m desperate to be able to erase as plans change, and they do a good job of
that. "
Carla,"August 20, 2018","The colors are not that soft and light and they take forever to dry. You know when you use a marker and at the beginning and/or the end of the line
it leaves a larger deposit of ink?If you erase while that is still wet you ruin the paper.Another thing, these are best to use with good quality paper because the paper
suffers a bit when erasing. However, when all is good, these erase very well.They do leave behind a transparent ghosting effect where it was highlighted
though, I can't figure out the right descriptive words to use BUT it is barely
noticeable. "
marytran33,"August 18, 2018",Love that you can erase the highlight.
Cynthian004 ,"August 9, 2018","I hate to seem greedy and only order when you offer freebies but it is a great

jailene.martinez,"August 7, 2018","When erasing highlight text in a paperback The book I was using was “Social
Science: An Introduction to the Study of Society”. it left behind faded black

not in textbook highlighting."
ddatar20,"July 28, 2018","I love these highlighters. I tend to make mistakes when highlighting, so its
great that they can be erased. The colors are also not too neon (unlike many
other highlighters) which I love."
mastini,"June 16, 2018","Love these. The colors are perfect. Tiniest drawback is that they are very wet
and bleed quite a bit. "
SarahLee,"April 14, 2018","Beautiful soft highlighter colors. Very pigmented and glides pretty smoothly. I
tested them on 3 different pens and pencil. There wasn't much smudging, but you
do want to make sure you give the ink enough time to dry just to avoid any.
Fully erasable which is a super cool perk!"

kennie,"January 14, 2018","These write much differently than most highlighters, in a really good way. The
ink is almost ""chalky"" and it shows up kind of milky over highlighted text,
which I really like, rather than sinking into the page. Erases so well, even
very thick highlighting. I love these for writing in my planner. I love to
highlight events, but sometimes things change!"

isobelc,"November 9, 2017","These are really good highlightings, erase really well and are really good for

emilee,"July 26, 2017","These are my favorite highlighters. I seriously can't stop raving about them. I
love soft pastels for annotations because they're eye-catching, but they don't
hurt to look at. Before I had these, I used the Zebra Mildliners for decorating
and highlighting. After I bought the Frixion highlighters, I've been using my
Mildliners way less! If you're looking for highlighters that are both pretty and
functional, these are the ones. "
polog90_08,"July 13, 2017","I actually bought both of these highlighters, and I like both of them but I'm

askleonlowell,"January 21, 2017","Could really be better. It smears all your pens by just highlight and erasing it
only makes it worse. If you want to erase it without any smears, use a blow

nice though."

a.compean6786,"January 5, 2017","Great set of pens. You need to get used to the ink as it's not the same

lainerz,"December 20, 2016","These are ok. They're a bit too light for my liking, you have to color several

shades, but they don't show up so well. "
mg.what,"August 30, 2016","I always wanted the subtlety of soft-colored highlighters and I was debating
getting these or the Uni Propus Soft Colors. I actually really hate the Frixion
line of pens. However after much research and review-reading, I got these
because I like to highlight in my planner and often plans/events/appointments
change. Now I appreciate the Frixion ink and I am extremely happy with my
purchase!"
writergirl120,"August 11, 2016","Absolutely amazing! I don't think I'm ever gonna suffice with standard
highlighters anymore. They erase so cleanly you can barely tell any ink was even
put on the paper. And without the mess! I also love the softer colors because
they're not so glaring on the paper. I like to use highlighters in my fiction writing as a sort of editing/revision
color coding system. Rather than wrack my brains trying to figure out a better
description or dialogue, I'll just put down whatever cheesy words I can't get
past and highlight it a certain color as a reminder to do something about later;
whether it's find better wording, decide if it even needs to be there, or
whatever the case may be. Not only do these provide more options, but they better serve the subtly in the
reminders I use them for when I'm re-reading manuscripts. Relatively easier to
overlook during an over-read and not as distracting. I think they'll also allow
for a vibrant highlight on more ink color options than just black, too. Plus the
ink output isn't overdone, giving a nice clean stroke without any squeaking or
initial smearing. All in all, I'm so glad I stumbled on these. Kudos to Pilot for FriXion's
remarkable innovation! "
fernandabueno2000,"June 26, 2016","The highlighters worked well when they arrived. The colors are nice and the ink

seem pretty disposable. "

lighter than normal, but it is precisely that which makes them perfect for my
use. The erasability is a plus."
emferg1031,"November 19, 2015","I love these highlighters. They make the text pop out, which is the POINT of
highlighters, but they are much easier on the eyes for academics or translators
like me who stare at highlighted pages for hours every day.  They're just
prettier, too, and don't soak through the way some highlighters can, even on
cheap pages or thin diary-type pages.  They'd probably even work in a Bible, but
I haven't tested that myself.  Get them if you want a change of pace, need more colors for your taxonomies, or
have weary eyes.  VERY good pens."

erase; however, the soft violet color is much lighter compared to the other 5
colors. It takes 3 passes to get a color with brightness even comparable to the
other colors'. I have put them in the freezer to try and fix this, but with no
results. I suspect it's just how the color is. The highlighters also seem semi-opaque, leaving a sort of cloudiness over the
ink it highlights. This cloudiness remains even after you erase the color, but
it hasn't significantly affected the visibility of the writing it highlights. It
might be an issue more with similarly soft-colored ink."
burnbox07,"November 9, 2015","Love them, they don't bleed through colors are great!"
deannembranchaud,"November 8, 2015","I love them!  Got them as part of my back to school shopping.  I'm always
constantly amazing people with them.  Easily erases and colours are cute"
nworbs,"October 28, 2015","I like these because they don't visually scream at my eyes. Like the rest of the
Frixion highlighters, they are drier than traditional ones. "
marme93,"October 22, 2015","These are amazing! I love how they are subtle yet still noticeable within a
textbook. And the erasing mechanism works perfectly."
Pikapaws,"October 16, 2015","Love the muted colors, these are much easier on the eyes than traditional
highlights and I think they are more attractive. The eraser really surprised me
how well it worked. Just let it dry first!"
shbirkwood,"October 2, 2015","The colors are extra light, and still have excellent coverage. The best part is
that they are erasable!! How many times have you highlighted the wrong thing, or
used the wrong color?  Easy fix now!"
fresprt721,"September 18, 2015","I really like the idea of these.  I wanted to used them for work and liked the
idea of being able to erase if i accidentally highlighted the wrong line item. 
BUT, these just dont last lone enough.  After highlighting one statement the ink
is so light that it becomes unuseable.  I am used to Sharpie or Zebra Zazzle
liquid highlighters that just seem to last forever.  If they come up with a
longer lasting version, I will definetly be buying again."
bvaughan29,"September 11, 2015","I was looking for Mildliner-esque color with Frixion erasability when I bought
these. Given that I haven't actually seen Mildliners in person, I'd say these
are pretty close. They are a bit darker than I was expecting, but they're
definitely not as vibrant as normal highlighters, which is also what I was
looking for. This could also be the fact that they're fresh outta the box, but I
thought I'd mention it. These have the same great unnoticeable erasability as
any Frixion pen, and I would definitely still recommend them to anyone!"
Kris,"August 21, 2015","I really like these highlighters.They erase well and are visible but not too bright/distracting.The one problem I have with them is that the yellow and orange and the blue and
green look somewhat similar so not ideal if you want to color code for more than
4 colors."
choomyaniii,"July 27, 2015",NO WORDS! Freaking awesome highlighters. Like where have these been all my life?

glitterandsilk,"April 9, 2015",Love these!!! Erase well!  And love the soft colors
BMP624,"March 19, 2015","These highlighters have a soft color which is much nicer over the print and
easier on the eyes than the standard harsh yellow or green."
emma,"March 2, 2015","JUST FYI: THESE ARE THINNER THAN AMERICAN HIGHLIGHTERSBUT, These highlighters are amazing! They don't bleed through, they stand out
but don't blind, and even purple and blue show the text beneath easily. The
erasers work perfectly, and on the occasion when I mis-color-code something it's
awesome to be able to erase and re-highlight!My only beef with them is how thin they are. They perfectly color text, but I
tend to write just slightly taller than the width of the wedge, so it's a
send-up between letting the color bar be too thin or doubling it and having it
be too tall. But it's hardly a deal-breaker, and I could have checked before
ordering if I'd really cared."

swright243,"December 6, 2010","I work in a science lab where we use and often spill stuff like water, alcohol
and acetone. I need a pen that won't run when it gets wet with water or
solvents. The Black Fine Point Pilot Multiball is perfect for lab use. It
doesn't run in any of these solvents and it writes on the slick label tapes
(Time Tape for those know) and on metal, glass and plastics of all kinds. On
glass and hard plastic, you have to write slowly and sometimes restart the pen
with a piece of paper, but it will write on hard smooth surfaces. True the
Sharpie can do all this, but it stinks and bleeds through paper too much to use
in a lab notebook. The Multiball does not bleed through and doesn't have any
odor.  The ability to rely on one pen all day to write on anything and at such a low
price and not worry about bleeding through, re-capping, smell, running when wet,
etc... makes my life just a little bit easier. We can all appreciate that. Next, I'm going to test all the colors with solvents and surfaces, but I'm very
optimistic about the results. Good job Pilot!"
fabulousrice,"October 7, 2011","I own over 2500 pens that I used successively for studies, illustration,
typography and several design and art projects / jobs and this pens stays on top
of my best pens in the world list for several reasons. The first reason is the
ink with which it is filled - dries fast, stays on most surfaces that exist -
and really solidifies when dries. It is simply awesome to use it on glossy paper
for example, like on magazines, but also on bottles when you need to write your
name on a bottle, but it is also very versatile and stays perfectly on every
type of paper if you need to write a report - and the ink is almost impossible
to remove from paper, which makes it perfect to use for signing checks if you
are afraid of frauds. In art experiments, I have used it to write onto film
strips or photos, to write or draw on several types of fabric and plastic, to
ink pencil drawings, and every time I am mind blown by how sturdy the ink
remains after it's dry. My art might still exist long after I die because of
that, and it's not only an amazing ink to work with, velvety, soft, with deep
shades and a beautiful texture almost like water but that hardens - it's also
reassuring to see how solid it is ( especially with pen tips medium and up, as
the pen exists in medium, broad, and extra broad under the permaball model
name). You could almost write under water with it...The second reason is the sturdiness of the pen itself, and the third reason is
its design. It's without a doubt for me one of the most beautifully designed
pens ever.Well, I have nothing but praise for this pen. Get it !"
andrewpeter29,"February 11, 2011","If I ever run out of paper, which probably won't ever happen, it's nice to know
that anything around me could potentially become my writing surface. So far,
I've tried it on glass and metal, and it really works well. On paper this thing
is a dream... it flows great and the ink is super duper jet black! It also feels
sharp, which is a bonus in my book!! I think this is destined to become my new
favorite pen! I can't wait to try it out on my bathroom mirror!!!"
bmf3000,"May 22, 2013","I do a lot of network marketing and I have always used a ultra fine tip sharpie
to write notes on a person's business card so I can remember who they were. I
needed a sharpie due to a lot of cards having a glossy surface. I hated that I
had to carry around such an ugly pen. But now I have discovered the MultiBall.
This pen is the best compromise of smoothness, fine line, and looks. This pen is
only a little more scratchy than a UM 138 uniball .38 tip pen. The ink dries
just a tad slower than a sharpie on glossy surfaces. But you wont hear me
complain. This pen is worth more than pens triple its cost. I now carry this pen
for everyday use"
copicforlife,"June 4, 2013","The only thing this pen doesn't wrote on is air and ghosts. I wrote on a wet
glass bottle of hot sauce, and it still worked."
snow.flake,"September 16, 2010","I love the black Pilot Multiball. The ink is dark and flows very satisfyingly
from the pen. Oddly, the other colors that I've tried (blue and pink) I would
only rate at 3 or 4 stars."
djlenz,"June 20, 2015","Inexpensive non retractable non refillable.  You won't cry if lost or stolen. 
The only ball pen I have tried that writes descent on slick surfaces.  Ink is
nice and black.  Writes rougher than a fountain pen on paper.  Probably how it
can write on slick surfaces.  The best ball pen for what it does but I prefer a
Milwaukee Inkzall.  "
johnludwigm,"July 16, 2013","Not a *bad* pen, but definitely not what I expected. The tip isn't shown in the
pictures, but it's VERY thin. It's non-refillable, which is vexing, but it's
okay. I do wish though that it were better advertised. The body is extremely
tapered at the ends and it has a VERY thin rubber grip. I wouldn't have bought
this had I known more, but it's not a bad pen."
Amy A,"February 4, 2022","I LOVE this pen for lab work. I see it as a better version of Sharpie markers.
Wish JetPens carried the other colors as well."
andrewpeter29,"January 13, 2022","I work in a pharmacy…I write on shiny labels, plastic syringes, glass vials,
different types of metal and also various grades of paper from birthday cards,
note pads, to copy paper. It writes on all of it well. Sometimes it will hard
start on really hard/smooth surfaces but not a real problem as it will catch up
after a few strokes. If it is really struggling (sometimes on glass) a couple
scribbles on scratch paper helps to coax it along. Sharpies are great on
non-paper surfaces but are horrible on paper. Ballpoint obviously work on paper
and even some labels but this is too cool because it works on everything! "
wallijonn,"May 31, 2019","Not very inspiring. No ""Wow"" factor; more of a ""Meh"". Where the Pilot MultiBall, Black, Medium lays down a thick wet line, this Fine
version is slightly scratchy, tends to drag and is not wet enough to lubricate
the ball better as it writes across the page.  My cursive script bunches up in places because the ball is not responsive enough
for fast directional changes. Block, Document, lettering is a little better, but
I find that I have to increase the blank spaces between words to avoid bunching.
Suffers from the same middle-of-the-line depression as the Black, Medium,
version. In cursive script it is not always obvious but in block lettering it
can more easily be seen. Just as the Blue, Medium, version is superior to the Black, Medium version, the
Blue, Fine, version is better than the Black, Fine, version. Both Black versions
look dull, are soft, have a pastel like shade, give a sheen off angle. The Blue,
Fine, version is a little better in that regard. The colour does not ""pop,""
though; it doesn't offend as much as the Black, but it is still dull. The colour
is closer to dark Navy ballpoint. Writing on the Kyoei A4 Writing Pad did not dramatically change its character.
Since this is more of a permanent marker than a smooth writing gel, it should
not be too bad since one will only occasionally use it for the purposes
intended. "
t.werntz,"December 19, 2014","I love these pens. They work great on my multi-media art projects, but.....three
of them started leaking soon after I used them. It was as if the tip stopped
rolling, so I threw them away. Bummer!!! I really like them, so I hope it is
just a bad batch. I gave them four stars for that reason."

Brit,"July 29, 2021","These are my FAVORITE pens. They write well on a variety of surfaces, don't
bleed through my Hobonichi, don't smear, and you can even highlight on top of
them. I originally bought them to write on washi, and they work great for that
(most brands at least). I wish this ink formula was in a wider variety of bodies
and refillable because I would switch to just using it if I could."
tesabee,"August 16, 2020","Artists dream! The ONLY  fine liner for both alcohol Based and water based art.
I have been searching for a fine liner/outline pen that I could use with my
copic markers,  my water colors and my Tombow brush pens. This pen does it all.
The energel clean comes in a close second for alcohol based, but nothing can
stand up to water like this pen. (Other than a sharpie, but who wants blobby
bleeding lines in their art?) the lines are clean and smooth (about as fine as a
micron 02.) no skipping, but lefty writers should be mindful that the ink has
some body and needs about a minute to set.  I tested swatches with a copic
blender, and a tombow brush pen blender; Immediately after, and in 5 minute
increments up to 1 hour. Immediately after laying down the lines, there was
barely any smudging. Of course no one fills in color immediately after laying
down a drawing. So this really is not a negative. 5 minutes after drawing, I
could go over my lines with both alcohol and water with no smearing or bleeding.
I really scrubbed at it, which no one would actually do, and it still didn’t
budge. AMAZING!!!! now you can actually just draw and color instead of having to
line last for fear of ruining your art. This pen also writes on glass, enamel,
gouache, oil pastel,  and dried oil paint, but it does need to dry for 15
minutes. It outperforms sharpies in this way. Definitely a must for artists,
especially illustrators and comic artists. Holds up to erasing as well. Ghosting
is minimal on Rhodia 80gsm paper. It will ghost on Moleskine, but that’s a
given. Anything over 80 gsm should be ghost free. Bleeding depends on paper, but
it didn’t bleed on cotton rag cold press watercolor, so I think it’s pretty
close to bleed proof too. "
Lunalii,"November 1, 2019","I find it so cool how it can write on every surface and act like a sharpie with

artistlyz,"July 11, 2020","It's amazingly light and comfortable to use and the ink flow is really good.

the page."
EnjoyPens,"May 29, 2020","This pen dries very fast, and that quality is appreciated, especially being that
I'm left-handed. On paper, the ink is a bold black that stands out. The pen
writes nicely, and somebody else borrowed this pen and they could tell quickly
that it was a pen of good quality. Sometimes I have to scribble to get the ink
to flow out better, but that hasn't been a big issue since it doesn't happen
incredibly often. Also, I've noticed that occasionally if I am writing but take
a moment to pause while the cap is still off, the ink pools up at the tip and
when I write, there is a thicker application of ink at first, but that hasn't
happened recently; overall that's not been a huge issue. When I write letters,
this has usually been my go-to pen to write with since other pens tend to smear
and I have to wait for other pens to dry between a number of words; with this
pen, though, I don't have to worry about smearing ink when writing with it."
jerryr,"March 20, 2020","It feels very nice in hand and writes very smoothly. Build quality is great. My
only problem is that this pen seems to be more inclined to leaving little ink
blobs when starting and stopping.  I typically wipe the tip very frequently when
using it to sketch with but this only takes care of half the problem. When printing my finished writing usually has a lot of small blobs. I frequently use a flexible nibbed fountain pen so I don’t think my problem is
because of a heavy hand. If you can still remember cursive this would probably be a great pen. "

start on paper before writing on shiny surfaces -- like glass. In the past I
cracked open these pens and put the filler in a Pilot G-2 clicker, but that was
a big mistake. The filler can dribble, and I ruined a shirt. The pen comes as a
pull-off cap and inside the cap is a slug of plastic that seals in the ink.Another big plus is that the ink is very dark and the line is consistent, so
even the smallest size is easily readable. "

the cartilage though. That's the one bad thing about this pen."
Chris,"April 15, 2017","I don't know if there was a bad lot of these or what, but out of the five black
MultiBall pens I've used (both fine and medium), four of them suddenly (after
only light to moderate use) developed a tiny shard of metal sticking out of the
ball area (gouging paper) and started to ooze ink all over. I love how this pen
can write on so many surfaces, but I'd like to use one for more than 30-60
minutes without it becoming unusable."
slowe0601,"April 11, 2017","This is a fun little pen. I'm almost afraid to use it because I don't want to
run out of ink...I suppose I should change my thinking. I can always buy more."
hawk89130,"March 27, 2017","These pens write on everything and anything.  This is great for mixed media
artists because the pen will even write over acrylic paint like no other pen
I've had.  I even tested it on the slick surface of a glazed, white tile...and
it wrote without skipping.  The ink is permanent and doesn't smear or run when I
paint over it with watercolor.  And...even alcohol ink markers don't seem to
faze it one bit.  What can I say?....this pen is great!"
tmricciuto,"February 9, 2017","I absolutely love this pen. I use it to write expiration dates on my beauty
products that are in a glass jar, and it works amazing on washi tape. "
elbren,"January 30, 2017","This pen needs some encouragement to write on coated cds, but it's happy with
paper, washi tape, and many other writing surfaces. It's in my everyday carry
case, even though all my other pens are finer, because it's so useful. "
iamthepineapple,"December 12, 2016","I really like this pen and am ordering some more. I prefer the medium point, but
that is just preference. It dries very quickly and even though I am right
handed, I imagine it would be great for lefties."
dottididit,"November 15, 2016",Good pen...I use it on my mixed media art projects
lubovich,"October 26, 2016","Great for writing in art journals, flows smoothly over painted surfaces."
jakkigarlans,"October 4, 2016","I use these pens for Zentangle  and I am very happy with the way they write on
the tiles and on watercolour paper which I use for ZIAs. The lines are sharp and
there is no feathering. Also, they dry quickly so I have had no problems with
smudging. An excellent alternative to the Microns. I do not know if they are
archival. If that is important to you, it would be important to investigate that
more thoroughly."
lidallieyen,"July 19, 2016","Love love love! It's like the Uni Pin Pen, but it dries within a second, only a
hair slower than the other pen. All in all, I think I'll be buying these pens
again."
Kussou,"June 5, 2016","Another pen for a sketchy inking/drawing style, it's nice to write with. Only
issue is that the ink would stop while drawing. So I also gave this away, my
cousin loves it."

spiderhawk_z,"January 27, 2015","These are nice, but where are the medium point pens?"
jobeg,"November 22, 2014","Not a fan.  It has a terrible weight; it is very top heavy when writing, unless
you keep the lid completely separate which risks losing it.  Terribly scratchy,
and not in a good way.  And to make matters worse, it skips when writing.  Plus,
the lid does not have a good snap when closing.  "

rmikefreeman,"February 23, 2014","I really enjoy using these pens. I bought one then upon testing it immediately
bought ten more. They really do write on anything as advertised.  "
sgoodwin4,"November 5, 2013","Awesome. Just got this from JetPens a couple of days ago and have been using it
at work since then. I'm a mechanical engineer and I use this for my notes,
marking/labeling, and some sketching (industrial design style sketching - not
drafting). Pen is light weight (this could be good or bad, depending on your
preference); pretty well balanced posted or not; and it has an average diameter
and nicely tapered rubber grip. I usually print but it is okay for cursive also.
Black ink is definitely black, not washed out dark grey. Line weight is about
equal to a 0.50mm Uniball Signo or a Pilot Precise V5. Three days in and this pen is definitely looking like a 'go to' for my day to
day work. So far it does it all for me: resistant to water, highlighters, Copic
and Prismacolor markers. Wrote on the corner of my safety glasses lens  and
wouldn't wipe off with my finger after it was dry (~10 min?). Apparently it will
write on anything - once you get it started. Not the best for sketching (gets a bit globby on long fast strokes) - for that I
mostly use either a Uniball Jetstream or a Uniball Signo 0.28mm."
ricardusloganius,"July 21, 2013","This was a neat find on the JetPens website.  I have seen several reviews of
this pen online and all were unanimous in their adulation of this pen.  So I had
to order a few.  It's a 0.5mm point so it's a tad smaller than I prefer, and
it's not quite as smooth as the Precise V5 but I think that the ability to write
on multiple surfaces is quite valuable, and I'm willing to pay a smoothness
penalty for it.  A couple of these are worth adding to your pen collection!  "
tintin.hobbes,"April 7, 2013","Best pen, especially at the price point! Ink dries fairly quickly, almost
instantly on decent paper. Comfortable and the tip is really solid. Grip is just
right in terms of how much rubber there is. I plan on buying more for school and
would advise you to buy some too. "
subarusti,"October 16, 2012","By far the best pen I've ever used. I've recently purchased several pens to
trial from jet pens, and ironically.. the cheapest of them all (the Multiball)
is the best performer. I've been attached to the US available Pilot Precise V7 and V5 for the longest
time, which the Multiball reminds me of intensely. I prefer a moderate amount of resistance/feedback when writing, it helps me keep
things legible when taking notes quickly and makes drawing freehand straight
lines less difficult. Like the Precise v5/7, I find that this pen has just about
the perfect amount of resistance. My writing style involves holding the Pen very close to the tip, which is very
uncomfortable on many pen designs. The multiball has rubber and a gentle radius
all the way down to the tip, making it a great choice if you have this same
preference in your pen grip. I should note that this Pen appears to be listed elsewhere as having a 0.57mm
tip. On paper it looks extremely close to what's left behind by a 0.5mm Ohto
C-305P Cart. I'd love to try this pen in a 0.7mm tip if it ever becomes
available."
Paulina,"July 19, 2018","Doesn't actually work on a coffee mug and several other surfaces as advertised
and is too thick for writing , in my opinion. "
maf3,"November 24, 2015","The worst pen that I have ever had.  Very scratchy.  Sorry that I wasted my
money."
iva925,"October 8, 2020","I thought I could live without TWSBI pens since I graduated to high end pens. It
turns out I cannot."
chng.lrn,"September 10, 2020","The ink flow of this pen with a medium nib lets it do some pretty impressive
line variation. The reverse side though is a better extra fine than an actual
extra fine. I can't stop using the reverse side. Depending on how much pressure
you're using you can some extremely fine lines. Really beautiful pen. Looks great regardless of what ink you put in it. I've got
some Diamine Oxblood in it right now and it's great."
The Wileyman,"July 16, 2020","It's a great pen. It gushed for a few days after filling but then it settled
down and writes with perfect flow."
fergusonosc,"February 27, 2021","I ordered this one for myself mainly because blue is my favorite color, but
aside from that this pen is really fantastic to look at and works incredibly
well when used. I use my fountain pen a lot since I'm currently in college and I
take a lot of notes and note-taking for me has gotten way easier when I got
started into fountain pens and this one just feels smooth and glides across the
paper with ease. Definitely worth its price."
steve5ned,"October 19, 2020","Love TWSBI pens and this is no different. The grip section is what really stands
out to me compared to the normal Diamond 580, as the little grooves make it not
prone to slipping."
Clem,"February 14, 2022","Just received this with a medium and I'm using it with TWSBI midnight blue ink
on Midori MD paper and it is incredible. The writing experience is superior to
the TWSBI Eco, which is already a great pen. The construction has a more premium
and durable feel than the Eco. And the nib seems better too. The writing is very
smooth and the ink comes out nice and wet. One complaint I have about the design
is that when you post the cap, it sits directly on the piston turning dial, so
if you try to twist the cap off, you could inadvertently push ink out of the pen
by turning the piston."
moongdss74,"May 22, 2021","TWISBI hits it out of the park! Workhorse pen that can handle even the glittery
of glittery inks and high pigment inks as well. Consistently writes and is ready
to go no matter how long it's been sitting."
farris,"September 15, 2020",Love the design and functionality where the cap serves to help turn the piston.
esolly5099,"February 19, 2022","This pen is my daily carry! I write all day and it is so comfortable to use.
Writes like a dream right out of the box.  Absolutely love the color.  I have a
second in my cart waiting  for payday!"
Mike L,"August 23, 2021","One of the better quality fountain pens out there for the money. This pen has
become my daily carry fountain pen. Feels substantial  in the hand with or
without cap posted and the ridged grip prevents slippage. Looking to buy my next
in a different size nib and color."

soorujakhtar,"July 17, 2020",smooth writing. Nib is thinner than Artpen medium Nib. Great ink capacity. 
amatte4808,"October 4, 2022","Gorgeous pen...been having my eye on it for a while. It's nice and heavy in the
hand, it writes very smoothly and refills with just a little added finesse since
it doesn't fill the cylinder the entire way. Overall best pen I've owned!"
dianalgarland,"July 4, 2022","I am loving how smooth this pen writes. I have more expensive fountain pens, but
this one just flows for me. I am currrently using Pilot Iroshizuku Syo-ro in it
and the combination of this pen, the medium nib, and the ink color is my new
favorite!I do usually post when I use a fountain pen, but with this one, it tends to
start to unscrew the end and I did end up with ink all over my fingers, so now I
make sure it is screwed on tight and I do not post when using it, lol. "
jbduer,"February 21, 2022","The pen is really beautifully built - tight, elegant and fun. It holds a massive

balancenergy,"December 22, 2020","I love how smooth is to write with this fountain pen,  the ink flows so well!
what I didn't aspect is the medium nib write more like a broad to me. If I use
regular paper, unfortunately, I can see on the back of the page what I wrote on

david,"September 3, 2020",Great fit...good looking.
rheimbro,"June 7, 2021","don't ever try to take the nib apart apparently, or you will never be able to

susan.guttentag,"August 18, 2021","Perfect colors that are perfectly transparent.  Not super fast drying but I’m
used to that now.  If using it for planner or journaling, best to use the
highlighter first and then write on it when dry for the best results."
cindi,"March 31, 2021","Really cute highlighters that are erasable. I like these because they're drier
than mildliners, so they don't saturate my notes."
johns27a,"December 12, 2020","These highlighters are so satisfying to use! They erase very well - I haven't
had any difficulty erasing my markings, and they don't leave any color residue
afterward. (It's also fun to show these off, since these are the only erasable
highlighters my friends have seen!) I also love the muted colors of this set -
more solid than the alternative neon, but still light enough to clearly see what
you've highlighted underneath."
rankkaapina,"March 23, 2022","I did some experimentation on highlighters and Pilot FriXions are the best fit
for me. I love the erasability, because I always make mistakes (although not as
important with highlighters). But I like how they are not super dark, I mostly
use them to highlight things in textbooks or normal books when I do language
study, and they work really well even with the super thin paper in my books in
Japanese. Definitely my preferred brand of highlighters. From these colors, I'm
not sure how I like the grey, but the others I love, it's nice to have
highlighters that are not neon colors."
cathy,"January 19, 2022","These are great to use when needing to change due to being erasable. The darker

JXH1,"November 16, 2022","I am a huge fan of the Pilot Frixion line.  In my experience, they highlight
well over all Pilot Frixion pens as well as over standard gel pens like Pentel
Energel, Writech, and Zebra Sarasa Mark On.  Although they work the same as the
other Pilot Frixion highlighters, I much prefer the new ""light natural colors."" 
If they came out with another expansion pack of colors similar to the Zebra
Mildliner ""Neutral Pack,"" this would be my perfect highlighter set."

mrichards0321,"September 14, 2022","I often find myself highlighting items and then later wishing I hadn't. I no

highlight and its gone without a trace."
parsons.diana,"August 22, 2022",The pastel frixion highlighters are some of my favorites 
elena,"August 18, 2022","These highlighters are beautiful colors and light enough not to obscure even
lighter print. However, they dried out very quickly, even though I kept them
tightly capped and in the case. Within six months, four of the six pens were
completely dried out and unusable. "
camelson,"August 1, 2022","Looking for that highlighter that doesn’t bleed out and mess up light ink
printings? These are it. Colors are light but do stand out. I highlight books
and these do not bleed thru. And if I change my mind, it erases with ease. "
MrGunn,"June 26, 2022","A very nice highlighter set, but with some nits: the Green did not erase well
and was smudgy; also I would have replaced the Salmon/Orange with Yellow;
finally the Red is very Red almost too much so.  The set works very well in
conjunction with the Frixion pens and both erased very clearly, except the
Green."

red}Overall it is a very nice set, it adds a nice ""pop"" of color without being to
distracting.I still have not decided if I would recommend FriXion Soft over Frixion Natural.
Both are very good, but if you want a more subtle highlight, go with the Soft. "

colors are not harsh (you can write over them) or too light. Because our
schedules change so much, the erasable feature is much appreciated. And you
really can erase ALL of the color, as long as you don't smudge it with your
finger while it's wet. It just occurred to me to order a black Frixion ball
point, so the entire entries are changeable. DUH!!"

Saltykelp,"June 11, 2022","Great pen body! I like this pen's weight distribution more than the original
Uniball One which feels slightly top heavy. However the Uniball One ink is unpredictable. It works great on some papers and
skips really badly on others. The fine point pen ink is near unusable with my
Nitto Stalogy 365 notebook.Also unlike the normal Uniball One, this new pen body does not fit Sarasa's Gel
Ink cartridge. "
Carolyn,"May 19, 2022","These are a little thicker of a pen body than the regular non-clicky Uni ball
signo gel pens, which is great if that's what you're into. The click itself is
really solid, and the whole pen feels well-built. I like the weight of it in my
hand.Only giving this four stars because even though the pen writes perfectly most of
the time, it does occasionally skip. I know this pen uses a different ink
formulation than the regular uni ball signo pens, so I will probably not refill
this pen body with the same ink refill when I run out."
jcarroll2181,"April 27, 2022","These pens are really pretty in person and are a great size.  I have kind of big
hands, and these thread the needle perfectly between ""too small"" and ""too
chunky.""  It's a .38 tip, so there's definitely feedback when I write, but it
doesn't feel scratchy at all.  Should fit in just about any pen loop, too, and
the clip feels sturdy.  "
Eliza946,"June 7, 2022","I bought one of these on a whim when I purchased the recently released limited
edition colors and I'm surprised by how much I like this pen.  Great ink flow,
but fine tip.  Not scratchy, but do you get a bit of feedback.  Pretty color
body, only wish they came with more ink colors."
kronikuuu,"January 17, 2023","The lines are a little thick for my liking and not a true .38 but that's to be
expected because it is a gel pen. I love how smooth it writes though! I love the
body size and shape. The texture of the pen is also very nice. It's not smooth
and just the barest bit rough for grip aid. The clip on it is my favorite clip
of all time though! I wish more pens had a similar grip. To be able to pinch it
at the top and have the clip open up makes it so much nicer to loop on my
journals or even through an actual pen loop without fighting it and ripping
pages or it getting stuck in the pen loop! If the ink was a little thinner I
would have ranked it a five star.."
lily,"January 11, 2023","I wanted a basic black gel ink pen for planning in my Hobonichi. Other pens I've
tried take forever to dry, however this one dries in about 5 seconds which is
quite fast for a gel pen. It hasn't smudged on me yet. The cute dusty mauve-pink
color and and 0.38 tip were a huge plus for me! I have small hands so it's very
comfy writing with it as well."
ADR in NY,"January 7, 2023","Love this pen! The body has good weight. The body colors are welcoming. I do
find the plastic material a tad slippery; I would have liked some texture on the
grip section. Not a fan of 0.38 mm tip, so it's nice to know I can exchange it
out for a 0.5 mm. Here's hoping Uni-ball offers the tip and clip in gold and
rose gold in the future! I recommend this item."

ADR in NY,"January 26, 2020","This review is about this pen's hybrid/emulsion ink and not the pen barrel
itself. What I love most about hybrid ink (with blue being preferred over black)
is its deeper color than that of ballpoint (oil-based) ink along with its
ability to be highlighted over immediately after writing, especially when
writing with the 0.38 mm tip. This is a quality I have learned to be grateful
for and appreciative of, especially considering the wait time necessary to
safely, with absolutely no smearing whatsoever, highlight over gel ink. Some
time, at least 10 seconds, is needed to pass before highlighting if using a 0.5,
and 0.7 mm tips and more if using a 1.0.  While I agree that gel ink produces a
more deeper and vibrant color and would ultimately be the one I choose for
everyday writing, hybrid ink gets very high marks for how long it lasts, its
richer color than ballpoint ink, and its ability to hold up extremely well to
water and water-based highlighters. Hybrid ink is my recommendation above all
others for students and extensive note-takers."
mrsbeaver,"July 10, 2020","Pros: - Gorgeous color and great use of graphic design and illustration incorporated
to represent Totoro, perfectly. - Comfortably placed gel cushion for grip and comfort. - Weight to pen, especially where gel grip is located (real metal used in this
area), so no worries of pen constantly rolling around on table. Still manages to
feel weightless and natural in hand when writing, too.- Ease of use when switching to different color barrels.- Ink quality is there and comes out smoothly and writes effortlessly. - Pencil feature is sturdy and works perfectly well. I've never had a multi-pen
have a pencil option, so this is pretty neat! Cons:- My only real complaint, just as with the Kiki pen in this same brand, would be
that of the gel grip. I keep it in a relatively covered case/pencil+pen holder,
but dust and other tiny, tiny debris still manages to find its way onto it and
make a home. This isn't the end of the world by any means, but it does become a
chore to try and clean off. So, it does raise a little concern of how long this
material will last before it starts to corrode – as I've had happen to other
gel grip pens of mine in the past – and becomes sticky or more unmanageable
debris begin to get stuck to it. All in all, a great, quality purchase that I would definitely invest in,
especially for other big Ghibli fans out there! "

and uni uses a shorter ink cartridge than anyone else. It is quite possible to
trim them down, but other than to make it inconvenient to not use their inks I
don't see a reason for it. It's a pen, don't try to lock me to an ecosystem. A little overpriced, but if you love the look you have to deal with it. "

deepo,"April 12, 2020","My second Ghibli jet stream multi pen.  I’m crazy about these. One for home,
one for office. The multi colors are great and the gel ink is excellent. Good
thickness, nice finger cushion area. And The Ghibli drawings are soooo cute!"
Abe White,"December 18, 2019","This pen is a good pen, with a few flaws.  To start, the ink flow is very heavy.
 By this, I mean that it is closer to a 0.8mm or 0.9mm pen.  Also, when it
hasn’t been used in a few days, it might be a little scratchy at first.  But
eventually it settles in to its usual rhythm, and it works very well.  It dries
very fast (3-5 seconds) and it works under most highlighters in about 8 seconds.
 I use it for bold text in my notes."
Markl,"November 14, 2017","Smoothest pen I have ever written with (smother than the 0.7 jetstream pens, 0.7

many more). Amazing for taking notes as the ink dries almost instantly so no
smudging when writing or using a highlighter. Amazingly designed grip which is
very comfortable for long writing sessions. Bold black ink that never skips or
halts. "

curlymelanie,"February 25, 2021","I have one quibble about this pen: this writes like a 0.4 or 0.5, definitely not
a 0.7. I bought the 1.0 in this brand it it writes like and 0.7. So size up from
whatever you usually prefer. Onto the good stuff. I've tried all of the major brands and this is the only one
that satisfies my criteria:- No smudging (I'm a leftie)- Thick enough ink (when I moved up to the 1.0)- Highlighter friendly. This is the best pen for highlighting, you don't need to
waitIn terms of pure writing pleasure I have a slight preference for the Pentel
EnerGelX 07, but it smudges with highlighters even after a long dry period. The
Sarasa Dry 07 is also a lovely pen, but it's extremely smudgy with a
highlighter. The Pentel and Sarasa are a bit blacker than the Uni Jetstream."

iWrite Now,"October 28, 2019","I was a longtime UNI307 user till one day my school book store started carrying
the EnerGel X 0.7mm and 5mm. The Pentel was the most comfortable ergonomically
perfect pen I've ever used, and it wrote just as smooth as the Uni307, maybe a
little bit better. Surfing around on this website looking for a replacement for
the old Flair's I found the Zebra Sarasa Dry Gel Pen - 0.7 mm - Black and all
the raves about it so I tried it. Amazing! It looks smaller but it fit my hand
better ?!  And as a bonus the 4mm is very easy and useful to me as well. And it
is also very cool that they have some style and different colored ink easily
available."
iWrite Now,"August 1, 2019","I've heard so much about this pen, I had to try one for myself.  Perfection! 
Better than the uni 307, even better than my trusty Pentel EnerGel X 0.7mm,
whose rubber grip and smooth writing was the best I had found. That is until
this work of pen perfection arrived in my mailbox. It fits and feels even better
in my hand. Writes smoother, more smear-resistant, it even looks cooler, and has
a spring-loaded clip. Something to fiddle with while you think about what to
write, or proofread.  "

rtdurr,"May 31, 2019","I like it. I ran out of Pilot G-2 .7 mm pens and instead of buying another dozen
I decided to try out a variety of pens from Jetpens. The biggest issue with the
G-2 .7mm and 1.0 mm was that they smear easily. They have bold vivid colors that
I really like, but if I could get that without the smearing that would be great.
To me this pen comes close. I don't have a black G2 .7 mm for direct comparison
but I like the way the ink looks on the page. Maybe the color is just a tad less
vivid than that of the G2 but it does not smear so easily."
bdubb71,"December 1, 2018",Way to much ink for my preference but did write smooth.
bpropp,"February 21, 2018","I like the form factor of this pen very much.  It is just the right size for
easy carrying in any pocket.  However, the refill leaves a lot to be desired. 
It is not any better than a bic stic in my opinion.  If they had a Jetstream
refill in this, then my rating would be 5 stars."
Mr E,"March 10, 2019","I like these pens. They're an ordinary click-top ball-point - but cooler. They
are very lightweight, and the body is an interesting flat-sided, part-round
shape that is remarkably comfortable to hold. The orange release/close button on
the side works well, and gives them a high-tech look. Another plus is that these
flat-sided pens won't roll off your table, or anywhere else.Note: The 'Boxy' logo is screen-printed onto the pen body, but the barcode seen
in the photo is a removable sticker. The pen looks and feels even sleeker
without the sticker."

elmnt,"April 5, 2019","This pen wasn't for me. It's all subjective, and lots of people like this one.
It's definitely unique, and the squared off shape would be cool, but just didn't
fit my grip. It's a small-ish pen, so perhaps not best for larger hands. It's a
very fine point, and the ink didn't flow too well, so a very thin, faint line.
Surprised that it's rated as a .7mm. It compares to a .38 Pilot Juice in it's
writing experience (only ballpoint consistency, not gel)."
ic2k,"February 22, 2022","The pen body is cool looking. It's made out of lightweight plastic, but it
doesn't feel flimsy. It's flat on two sides so it cannot roll off of a table.
The click action is fun to fidget with and works well enough, but may get stuck
if you don't hit it in the right spot. The pen is a bit small which would make
it uncomfortable for long writing sessions.Two stars deducted for the horrible ballpoint refill, it's super scratchy, worse
than a bic. I replaced it with a hi-tec-c refill and it's a pretty good EDC pen
now."
jkendra43,"January 6, 2020","It's a neat, light weight pen.  It is the least expensive of the pens that I
have, but I tend to pick it the most."
jonlin11,"October 10, 2019","It's a great pen and unique in design. Ergonomically, it's for people with
smaller hands and people who use a death grip. Is not very comfortable with a
tripod grip, and is at the boundry of unbearable with medium-sized hands. The
pen was overall smooth and reliable."

but is is good for an everyday pen to throw in your pocket"
ADR in NY,"March 2, 2019","I've been on the hunt for vintage looking, simply-made ballpoints, so I snatched
up a couple of these. I knew I wanted a smoother writing experience, so I made
sure I purchased several Pilot LHSRF-8C gel ink refills to replace this pen's
oil-based ink. The pen feels small in my hands (just a fact, not a complaint).
I'm not sure how anyone with large hands would fair using this pen. Wish the tip
end was weightier which would balance things for me. Also, be careful when
changing refills as the orange piece springs/pops/flies out when removing the
push mechanism from the pen body. For a very simple ballpoint, this pen will do."
bigbogie,"October 7, 2018","Fun little ballpoint pen that's about the same size as the Skilcraft U.S.
Government ballpoints that I have used for decades.  I like that no one else in
my office has a Boxy 100, so I can readily identify my pen if I absent-mindedly
set it down on someone else's desk.  I don't much like the original Uni S-7S
refill, which I think makes a line that's too thin and too ""skippy.""  However,
even though a Pilot BTRF-6F refill is not listed as a Recommended Refill for
this pen, it fits perfectly, and I think the Pilot refill writes smoother and a
bit darker than the Uni S-7S.  In addition, a Zebra F refill will actually work
in a Boxy 100 if you remove the plastic plug from the end.  The Zebra refill
writes almost as well as the Pilot, and holds much more ink."

zandrewsmith,"February 15, 2022","I took a chance on the Boxy based solely on the design. I wasn't sure how the
squared barrel was going to fit in my hand, but it's quite comfortable. Overall,
the pen might be small for a large hand, but it's got a smooth, sturdy feel and
writes well. The ink isn't quite as rich a gel, so if you use thicker stock
paper you might need something a little bolder. If you're looking to replace
your everday ballpoint used on everyday paper with something compact that writes
well, this is a great option."

doesn't use any metal pens at all, where as I'm always buying Parker Jotters and
nice fountain pens. She said this one reminded her of a pen she used growing up
and was delighted.I don't use it for long periods of time because my fingers want something round
for the long duration. It's just more comfortable. This is good for leaving on a
surface with a pad of paper when you want to quickly jot down notes.It's also good to carry one if someone wants to borrow a pen. You don't want to
be stuck with you $200 Waterman or whatever.Final note, the boxiness keeps this pen from rolling off the kitchen table, and
that's pretty cool. "

jonesfive,"February 1, 2019","After hours of studying medium black or black variation ink pens and purchasing
a dozen I received them and tried them out. I graded them from 7-10 and gave
this one a 8. It is a smooth writing pen, but I will have a hard time getting used to the flat
side - it comes across as being a rather thin pen. It will be a decent pen for
writing some note/list down, but I won't use it for serious writing.What I LOVED is the Uni-ball Jetstream RT BLX Ballpoint 1.0 Brown Black one the
most. My wife who generally likes fine points and I both agreed that it is a top
quality pen. I/We will be buying the 5 color set for sure!"

Mmwoodcock.art,"April 27, 2016","I loved testing out the pens. I would say my favorite out of the testers-
Disposable Zebra pen (medium), the Fudegokochi pen, & the Pilot brush pen (black
casing). I went back and bought the Zebra fine tip. I felt it had just the right
amount of resistance for control but was no scratchy like the white Pilot pen
shown. The Touch pen smeared when used with markers/watercolor. "
ruddyb,"June 16, 2017","I think I just have to get used to them.  The long, brown pen (sorry, can't read
Japanese) is thick and luscious, like a long set of black eye lashes (but in a
bunch).  Push softly and carefully and beauty is released - too hard and
uuuggghhh.  The others are more forgiving - not like an outright calligraphy
pen.  The in a category of it's own pen is the beige with the loop in that I am
not sure if it would be a medium or fine point.  The Zebra and Kuretake can be
thicker if you use the edge but otherwise a medium point.  The pilot is the
finest and can take a heavier hand.  I can't say which is my favorite yet but I
will keep writing with them and update.  Excellent gift to yourself or anyone
who appreciates pens.  Much to explore.        "

kmac4949,"April 12, 2016",I really like these pens. 
Blackhorse,"November 22, 2020","I looked at a video review of this on YouYube and it reminded me that I had seen
and tried to get this some time ago via a few Asian vendors...with no success.
So I grabbed this as soon as I saw it.  Just got it in hand and couldn’t be
more pleased.  The build is, of course, like a tank.  The fit and finish are
typical Rotring...which means perfect. The line quality is very good and quite
fine.  I usually prefer a more medium line for general use so I ordered a few
blue and black Uni Jet Stream Prime High Grade D1 refills that are 0.7mm.  I
LOVE that Jet Pens lists compatible gear with each item they offer.  This is not
an inexpensive item but it is singularly unique and super high quality.  I have
other Rotring 600’s that I use regularly...this is fatter and feels even
better in the hand.  Excellent multi pen...likely the finest made anywhere."
robertdangel3,"July 19, 2021","Had one of these back in 2000 and it was great!  This is the new one and I’m
not happy with it, it is not as sturdy as the original.  The paint chipped off
in several places on the first day I had it,(office Environment).  "
The Bloated Boomer,"June 28, 2022","Just bought one and I am very happy with the performance, style and weight. I
have several older Rotring multis and they are wonderful pens but they weigh a
ton and are not conducive to extended periods of writing (I am synopsizing and
annotating Shakespeare's works for the intellectual stimulus). This pen, on the
other hand, is lightweight, fast and with the knurled finger grip, firm and
steady in my hand. The pull-out feature to change refills and load the pencil,
also makes a difference in the weight, as the older multis unscrewed and the
sides were thicker. The barrel on this one is thinner (hence, lighter) and that
makes a noticeable difference in the handling and performance.The only drawback, minor as it is, is that it does not offer an eraser in the
cap, like the older models did. It is no great annoyance (I have erasers all
around) but it would have been nice to have the eraser in the cap. Overall best buy -- good utilitarian value -- 4.5 stars.  "
cardboardchair11,"February 22, 2022","I used this pen each day for school when I got it. About 3 months later the pen
began to jam whenever I twisted it. I removed the barrel a few times and never
had a memorable time where I dropped it. Give it a couple more days and now the
barrel is completely stuck inside the pen and I can't refill it. Still a really
nice pen, if only it was more durable and didn't jam so easily."
sethpet,"December 10, 2020","Simply the best, it’s a shame they can’t keep these in stock.. Was very
happy to order mine!"
waynegreen4131,"September 10, 2020","Flawless build I would definitely recommend the black finish compared to the
silver. "
Lwiener,"November 25, 2022","Convenient and effective color/pencil changing mechanism. Looks good. Easy to
handle. No issues …..so far…"
writegeorge,"November 17, 2022","I'm really a fountain pen guy but sometimes when I'm out I need to write on
unfriendly surfaces like a glossy card, etc. This Multi Pen gives me great
flexibility and is a precision instrument that I'm happy to have."
sheilakk9,"September 22, 2022","I wasn't able to use this pen a lot because my husband stole it from me :-) But
it's got the typical Rotring heft and reliability."
adhizen,"March 1, 2022",I love Rotring pens and pencils. They are the best.
jaikj008,"February 1, 2022","Amazing Build quality and hand feel. The pen is very heavy but based on the
weight distribution, it feels very light in the hand. Switching is very easy as
well and can be done with one hand. The knurling is amazing as well."
mbeasom,"January 3, 2022","I really wanted to like this. I love multis, but this one has the most horrible
ink cartridges possible. They skip terribly and the ink is so pale as to be
unreadable, even the black. As for the pencil, it works beautifully, with one
issue. Where is the eraser? A pencil without an eraser? Excuse me?"
weisma.m,"December 20, 2021","great pen. I love Rotring design, and JetPens is a great company. I had a

silver and black."
smrichards3,"December 10, 2020","Great pen for daily use. The quality is noticeable. Love the convenience of
having 3 options in 1."
dittm001,"January 22, 2021","The new Rotring 3 in 1 pen at first glance looks similar to the original  (one
of which I own). However, in weight , exterior surface (slightly more rough) and
changed internal mechanics, operation and overall quality, it does not match the
original pen."
dreed,"April 6, 2022","As for the body of the pen, I thought that it looked cool on video and on
pictures so I got it, but I have to say it looks much worse in person. I can't
put my finger on it, but it's so much less.... pronounced? Like it is dull in
comparison to the pictures. I can't find good words to describe this. Also, the
clip presses into the angled bits of the pen, so it would crush your paper. If
this trapezoid is top half of the pen, /¯\, the clip would apply pressure on
the / and \, crushing the paper that you attach it to. Also, the half metal half
plastic construction makes it feel uneven, and my experience writing with metal
pencils is messing me up since I expect some counterweight at the top when there
isn't any. Of course, this is personal, so your mileage may vary. I have to say
though the feeling of the spring when clicking is nice, but this is a super
minor detail only the snobbiest of snobs would care about. It feels like a
Cherry MX red switch if you doubled the activation force with a nice tactile
bump if you quadrupled the Cherry MX blues or tripled the Oetemu Blues. The ink is not great either. It's reasonably smooth, but it's so small that I
can feel the little grooves on low quality paper. It also has issues with large
ink globs being deposited occasionally as I write, something I don't experience
with other Uni Jetstream pens. The line is a little fine for me, but that's just
preference, and I haven't experienced any of the dropping out of the inks others
have been reporting, so it seems like that's hit or miss.If you're getting it for the ink, I think that you'll be a little disappointed,
and this is only the 0.38mm one. If you're getting it for the body, I'd say go
for it, especially since apparently you can fit a hi-tec-c ink in here, although
I haven't tried for myself. "
Alexis,"November 1, 2021","I am having difficulty writing with this. Its either working fine one minute or
giving me nothing the next. This could be just a faulty pen but when it works
its fine and precise just the way I like it."
darrin_lau,"May 2, 2022","Nice body and color. I have a hard time finding good pens that writes smoothly,
being left handed. The only draw back is that the pen feels light, which is
deceiving. "
hockeyman0+jetpens,"August 26, 2021","Fantastic pen, but note that it’s tip does not fit into the standard jet
stream models."
hillgreg02,"December 22, 2022","Great Pen!I don't understand why some reviewers don't like this pen.  To me, it's
beautiful, easy to hold and write with, and the fine lines are smooth and dark!Perfect pen to use for fine writing!"

tamoro88,"March 14, 2022","I really like the look of this pen. I like the weight, the finish, the color.
The unfortunate issue I have is if you accidentally drop it with the ball point
out- the weight of the pen can break the nib. I’ve had to replace it twice."
Gabe,"March 12, 2022","I don't know if its just the pen I received but the pen skips a little on a few
strokes, but it is still usable and I still prefer it over the other pens I own
because of my small handwriting."
alperen.acikol,"March 8, 2022","Bought two one for myself and one for my wife, we love them! The ink flow is
amazing, and I really enjoy using this pen. "
Alexis,"March 8, 2022","This pen changed my life. I got a Happy Planner Mini as a gift, and I've been
having a hard time finding a ballpoint pen fine-tipped enough to use in. My
Hi-Tec-C pens smear when I use my highlighter over them, which is disappointing.
This is the perfect solution. I used to keep a handful of pens at my desk for
different purposes, but have since abandoned most. I use THIS daily now. The Uni
Jetstream Edge is so comfortable! And it doesn't smear under highlighter or my
Zebra Mildliners like my Pilot. The script it puts out is easily mistaken for
gel at first glance - you have to examine it closely to realize it's oil-based.
The ink flow is incredibly smooth and consistent. And it has the added bonus of
being perfectly coordinated with my TKC Candybar Keyboard (red keys on a black
aluminum case). I ordered a blue refill with it and changed it out immediately. It's a lovely
shade of blue-black, not an annoying bright blue like so many. Perfect.My ONLY complaint is that I really wish I could get brown refills for it, but
that's what you get for going with ballpoint over gel. So, I still have to keep
my brown 0.3mm Maica pen handy for journaling. The fact that refills are
available in black, blue, AND red is great. So often I can only find black or
blue for pens I fall in love with, and I prefer lower contrast hues. "
jtbaker4205,"March 8, 2022","Pen itself is fantastic.  The weight feels good, the grip feels good, and it
looks awesome.  I switched out to a uni sxr-80-05 .5mm because the .38 mm felt
to scratchy for bote taking, but works great with a ruler."
maxredins,"March 3, 2022","Great pen, smooth and fine like wine."
robert.mcmillan1,"March 2, 2022",I love these pens.  Quite possibly my favorite style.
NaiRah,"February 15, 2022","I love that the tip is fine. It writes well but the more I used it- it skipped

know because I misplaced it the same day!! I will purchase it again to see if it
does the same thing. "
ingkayoverwatch,"February 13, 2022","Really nice I love the build on it and the fact that the spring is at the top

Bella Marie,"August 20, 2017","Has a nice gold color though it's a bit dark. It takes a little while to dry but
as expected from gel pens. I love using this pen for adding stars in my notes or
in drawings. I feel like the ink isn't always flowing so I need to rewrite
letters over sometimes. But as a whole I would still buy this pen again!"

stacycarterhb,"July 26, 2017",These pens are just perfect for writing on mixed-media surfaces.
angle13_13,"June 26, 2017","Incredibly opaque, lovely gold color. Ink flows smooth, but quickly, so be
careful in tight spaces, because the nib is broad and the ink will run out fast.
Fine detail work, besides dotting, is not recommended. Shows up great, but
something about it makes mistakes very hard to cover over. The pigment can be
marked out, but the metallic particles always show through. "

KimberlyInOhio,"May 29, 2017","I got a few of these in different colors as I need to write on folders that have
dark colors like purple and navy. The ink seems to flow slowly, so it's hard to

ajalder,"January 24, 2009","Jetstream ink is the best on the market for ballpoints. Wow. How the get it to
be so smooth and quick drying is almost magic! LOL, magic. Anyway, I was a bit skeptical about this pen because of the 0.5mm size; I
figured that it would be too small and not work well.  I was partly right. If you are writing on a pad, notebook, journal...something
that has a few pages to it, it writes very well. Incredibly smooth, unbelievably
precise and beautiful in output (unless your hand writing is as bad as mine).  But if you are writing on a single page or something that is a bit rough, it
doesn't work that great. I was trying to write on some post-its will holding
them in my hand...ink was sporadic. Single piece of paper? Well, not so much.
Pen is a bit to sharp for that and it doesn't give a great surface for the pen
to roll on.  But for most things, it is awesome. I do find it a bit to fine for my overall tastes, but that's just me. I will use
it, but not for writing my life story or translating War & Peace.  The fit and balance of the pen is very very good. A little on the light side,
but it's a plastic pen that you are paying $2 for. The rubber grip handles well
and isn't too sticky. Overall this is a great pen.  Just remember: Uniball ink = magicLOL."
mse916,"October 20, 2013","So far my favorite pen, I plan on buying a replacement shortly. (if you don't like reading skip to the bottom for the summary) Functionality ( 7.5 / 10 ) It's hard to get a better pen than this when it comes to functionality. It
writes very smooth, the resistance when writing is extremely low, to the point
where it's almost too little resistance. This pen flies so it takes a steady
hand to write neatly. I like thin line pens, so this pen being a .5mm is great. Ink ( 8 / 10 )The ink has been very steady through out the life of the pen, responds to
relatively sharp angles (with respect to the page) well. Virtually no blotching;
as stated earlier the pen writes very fast very easily, so if you start going
really fast it can get a small build up or ink on the top of the ball. This was
never a problem for me though. Comfort and Style ( 8 / 10 )Really, there is nothing wrong with the style or comfort of the pen. It fits in
your hand nicely, the grip at the front is really rubber, not just some sort of
plastic. The grip has not worn out or began to shed bits of rubber. I like the
look of the pen, sleek and somewhat futuristic looking. The thickness of the pen
is appropriate, just what you would expect from any medium sized pen. Summary: If you like: Pens that write thin such as other 5mm pens and if you like to
write very fast with very little resistance. Buy this pen. The only fall back is
that if you are a sloppy writer, this pen will not help you with writing neatly
at all. All others, Buy the pen you'll like it."
sorojfk,"May 1, 2011","This is the best pen i have ever owned! It always runs so smoothly. The only
times it isn't smooth is on cheap paper, when there's only 1-2 sheets between
the pen tip and the desk, but even then the overall flow is mostly smooth as can
be. What I really love is the precision. I used this of Organic Chemistry, where on
the tests we have to draw little chemical structures in small answer spaces. I
was able to get everything down that I needed to only because of how thin this
pen writes, and how precisely it dries on the paper. I could give it a higher
recommendation! I only wish they had a compact version. Then I'd be set for
good."
loversflyingfree,"February 11, 2012","My current go-to pen; I'm in love.  I carry it with me everywhere. PROS- ink does not smear (so perfect, especially since I'm left-handed)- lines are crisp- color is rich (compared to ordinary ballpoint pens)- tip is sharp, but not to the point of being scratchy CONS- If you write with it at a really low angle with the paper, the tip gets
scratchy and the line a bit blotchy.- When making initial small marks (e.g. bullet points, tiny writing), it won't
work at first.  Gotta try a few times, or make a large trial stroke. Pros definitely outweigh the cons, considering the two cons are circumstantial."
zric11,"March 10, 2016","A big letdown. I bought one of each color {black,blue and red}. They all suffer
from real bad ink blobbing. You have to clean the tip constantly. Draw a line

blobbers in a deep dark drawer. Bummer."

Tangle List,"December 28, 2019","I never thought I’d like a ballpoint pen again, but the Uni Jetstream is so
good that I’m here buying a refill. The only reason I purchased one in the
first place is because I love the Uni brand and was curious about the hype
surrounding the Jetstream. I was blown away after giving it a try! The Jetstream
writes so precisely and smoothly no matter how hurried my writing is or what
paper I’m using. It’s excellent for super quick writing, on-the-go writing,
or if you grip your pens in an unusual way. The Jetstream might be a ballpoint,
but this is no cheap BIC or doctor’s office freebie. This is a quality pen."
rlbond86,"September 18, 2019","I'm left handed and this is the best pen I've ever used. It has a precise tip

kim31227,"November 25, 2012","Simply amazing. Before, I was reluctant to use ballpoint pens as I was addicted to gel ink pens.
But, I couldn't deny the amazing feel and smoothness of a Jetstream ballpoint
pen. The Jetstream Ballopint Pen - 0.5mm is superb. It grips the paper just the
right amount so that the appropriate amount of smoothness is applied. This pen
glides across the paper. Like me, this pen is perfect for a student who takes a
lot of notes. If you're having trouble deciding between the 0.7mm and the 0.5mm, go for the
0.5mm. True, the 0.7mm is smoother but the 0.5mm has the perfect amount of
smoothness AND precision. Recommended! "
e.khangin.kim,"March 12, 2012","I really wanted to like this pen -I really did- but ultimately the pen's
inconsistent writing turned me away. Don't get me wrong I have read all of the
reviews for this pen and thought I was getting an absolute steal. My issue is
with this particular model of the jestream line. When I first used the pen out
of the box, it was pure bliss. But once the ink went down to about 2/3 of its
total fill, the problems started. Whenever I write with this pen, the ink flow is horrible. On every horizontal
stroke, the ink just refuses to flow unless I scratch my paper with enough
strength to shame a lion, and a mess to compare. more recently, the ink has
refused to flow even decently in ANY direction. The feeling of writin is lumpy
and uncomfortable. It really is a struggle to write with this pen. Just to note I have dropped this pen a few times, from a desk's height, but I
refuse to accept that that distance was enough to cause a malfunction in the
flow of the pen. To make sure that this wasn't a fluke or a dud of a batch I purchased a few more
of the same 0.5 mm black jetstreams. Sure enough, even these pens exhibited the
same behavior 1/3 of the way down."

Zipper1,"January 1, 2023","Karlee my daughter is in a certificate program for radiology and uses this pen
constantly!She said she must monitor who borrows it as it will not come back. LOL. It is
different enough that she will notice it when they use it, or she goes for it,
and it's missing. She ran through the first ink cartridge and lost one. She
keeps coming back to it.  Although not a gel it has one of the best and most consistent lines I've ever
encountered on a ballpoint. I have one as well and enjoy using it, both for the
ergonomics and the produced line.Pretty tough to beat this pen."

pen, and quick drying. This means that it’s more ergonomic than most
ballpoints that use highly viscous ink.Get it, get multiple. Get 5. Keep one in your EDC, school pen case, kitchen

this pen). Given its price point, I would say this pen is one of the best
options on the market for students."

I have is that it occasionally has dry starts, which can be quite annoying.
Otherwise, I've been using it non-stop without significant issues. "

still flowing.  There is lots of ink showing in the cartridge.  I've tried all

Jetstream because its such a great pen. What if it happens again? Ugh."
jaikpatel7,"March 14, 2018","Right out of the box it wrote superbly. It felt super smooth almost gliding over
the paper, laying down the ink effortlessly. It was a little scratchy but for
the most part no issues. It was especially useful for note taking or any writing
that requires you to write quickly.  3 months in, HOWEVER, the ink begins to skip. I thought maybe this is was a one
off issue but I had also bought the multi pen and ran into the same issue
(notable only for the black color). I genuinely tested it for hours, and really
tried to get out what I thought might be a clump of ink stuck but to no success.
If this happened once I would think ""bad luck"" but it has happened twice now so
I feel like this might simply be an issue with the pen. Again I would like to
emphasize that the pen works amazingly but the inconsistency in the ink flow it
what dropped it two stars. "

Jetstream body came in some other color than white or pastels, similar to the
black Jetstream Sport 0.7 or the dark blue Jetstream Standard 0.38 body.  Yes, I
could put an 0.5 refill into one of those other bodies, but I like the refill
and the markings on the body to match."
gaygm,"September 27, 2016",Great pens.  Love the 0.5mm tip and the crisp black lines.This is by far my favorite writing pen for everyday use.

low enough for me and I end up holding it uncomfortably on the borderline with
the plastic tip. It's such a bummer, because I love the look of this pen; It
writes so smoothly and the 0.5 mm size looks crisp on paper. I will probably end
up putting the cartridge in another body."

BGMcAlister,"February 14, 2016","This pen was recommended by Jet Pens customer service when I made an inquiry
regarding another pen I was looking for.  If you want an everyday pen that is
comfortable, not too heavy, writes the first time every time, doesn't smear (I'm
a lefty), this is the pen for you.  For the price buy two or three.Thanks Jet Pens!"
jencz10,"January 5, 2016","the thinnest, smoothest ballpoint pen you'll ever write with, like ever. It may

butter. Not very expensive as well.  "

UglyShaZam,"September 2, 2015","This is by far the best pen I've ever used.  It's extremely smooth and clear on
paper.  It has a sturdy clicker as well, along with a great design.  The only
problem is if you're writing on a really hard surface, as in with a single sheet
of paper on the desk or table, the pen seems to skip and the ink doesn't come
out as smoothly or consistently.  Other than that, it is a terrific pen."
AMRA1787,"August 11, 2015","This style and size of writing is my absolute favorite. I am a pen fanatic! My
first Uni 0.5 mm pen was given to me and it was from Japan. I spent a month
searching online a store that carried these specific pens and was absolutely
ecstatic when I found JetPens! If you like thin pen writing this is your pen.
It's doesn't not bleed or smudge! However k do go through them fast because I
use it daily. One pen can last me a month sometimes less. I am definitely
ordering again! "

it became a distraction. I want to buy this pen again."

joeyldev,"October 30, 2014","This is currently my day to day use pen.  It replaced my .07 mm Jetstream.  I

of both worlds with this ink and pen.  Really good...did I already say that?"
janamjhaveri,"September 14, 2014","I got four of these pens. Initially, they all worked really well. However sooner
or later (within the span of a few months, they all started experiencing the
same problem: ink is sporadic and so the pens don't write very well. I'm
disappointed and will not be buying these pens again"
Randy.josleyn,"September 13, 2014","Not sturdy enough for me. This pen is quite reliable; it writes smoothly and consistently. The plastic
clip is flexible enough to clip to a back pocket lining easily, but without the
danger of it falling out. I have not worried about the ruggedness. But—I kept
this in my back pocket with a memo book for about a month before one day, when
the clicker mechanism apparently got damaged. It still works, but it doesn't
write smoothly anymore. I guess I did a number on it."
sasmith3,"August 16, 2014","Like this every day use pen a lot.  It's one of the smoothest writing 0.5mm pen,
I've written with.  Comfortable grip.Nice firm click.  Thought went into the design, and I like to look at it."
argen.47,"May 9, 2014","Absolutely love this pen. I was a 1.0mm pen user for ages (I know right??) but
then I moved to 0.7mm which I definitely realised is much better. However, after
seeing this as one of the pens on Jetpens with the highest/most reviews I
decided to try it out. Will never go back, I've basically decided this is the pen I'm going to use for
the rest of my life as a daily pen, so I've bought a 20 pack. It's pretty smooth
and I love how much smaller I can write after using 1.0mm pens for so long. The only negative I can think of (and it's a smaaaalll negative) is that the pen
is quite light. TBH I didn't realise this until I tried the Uni jetstream with
the alpha grip. So if you like having some weight to your pens this might irk
you a little. This is such a small gripe I had to give the pen 5/5 anyway."
phatndn,"April 4, 2014","I have to say that this is a great writing pen especially if you like to write
in cursive. This pen is probably one of the smoothest I have ever written with,
hands down. There isn't too much to say about it besides the fact that it is
""sleek"" and very light weight (plastic casing).  This is a great pen but I prefer to use 0.7 mm Jetstream pens as the 0.5 mm is
way too fine for my liking; if very fine pens are your thing, look no further.
You can't go wrong with the price tag on these either. 5/5"
Garland Penfreak,"March 19, 2014","This and Uni's Signos are my favorite pens, with this one in light green  being
my best loved pen, even more than my high dollar pens. You might know my niece
would steal the green one, and now I must spend shipping charges to get another.
I should have ordered an extra. But I did stock up on the 0.5 and 0.7 refills. I
use both extensively, and they fit the Signos perfectly, and I love their
pastels as well. They are as great as Ink Joy, whc is not available in fine
point. I've gone through every pen and refill on the market, and this is The
Great One.  I hope they still have the pastel green. The niece is NOT
surrendering it. You can even put the silver tips from the Signos on this if you
like. YEAH I'm a real pen freak. How'd you know? OH, the pocket protectors gave

mand0142,"December 11, 2013","This is a great pen.  I'm very impressed with both how smooth it writes and the
fact that it actually is a 0.5 mm (i.e., a fine point) ballpoint pen.  It
doesn't smudge or leave blots.  I've used this for more than a year now and it's
my favorite pen.  I initially purchased the same one in the 0.7 mm size and it
too is great (still quite fine for a ballpoint) and probably caters to even more
people.  However, I like both sizes that I've purchased and I keep coming back
to buy more refills.  This is easily the smoothest and most reliable ballpoint
I've ever used.  I've just learned that an even finer point (0.38 mm) is
available too - I just bought one and will soon try it out."
annie.lacio,"October 15, 2013","Some blotting, but still my go-to pen. I bought 3 of these after reading glowing
reviews on a few blogs. I have to say, it is the nicest disposable pen I have
ever used but I'm not completely satisfied. All three of the pens I bought
result in about a 5% rate of blotting with smudge. But man is it SMOOTH! The
writing is so nice that I have simply resolved to use caution with the blots"
cynthia.r15,"July 12, 2013","My favourite pen ever. It writes so smoothly and the ink is incredibly vibrant
and truly black. What's even more incredible is that the ink is 100% black until
months later when there is /literally/ no ink left in the pen, unlike Papermate
Kilometrico pen ink that look faded a week into use. The only downside is that I can't stand low quality pens now... the entire
Jetstream range writes so smoothly that you only put minimal physical effort
into writing :0"
claydavis.cd,"February 20, 2013","This pen is by far the greatest pen I have ever used!  While the waterproof
attributes and smudge resistant ink are both incredible, the agility of this pen
is what impresses me most.  The pen is quite fine, however it is able to make
markings that are incredibly manipulatable while still writing smoothly.  I feel
so happy to have found a pen that possesses the features of high quality
(waterproof, smudge resistance) but also maximizes the basics to a level in
which they are noticed.  I am spoiled by this pen."
may.yen144,"January 31, 2013","I cannot recommend this pen enough! This is my go-to pen for taking notes,
solving numerical problem, and creative writing. The line is sharp and dark. It
writes very smoothly and does not smear. I used to get my pens from Office Max,
Target, Walmart - but now I just buy dozens of refills these jetstream pens I
own(I own black, blue, red, green). Both the 0.5 mm and the 0.7 are excellent. I
suppose the only bad thing is that you will reach for this pen so often that you
might have to refill more than expected. I am a moderate user and I have to
refill the pen once every 2 months..."

it'll keep performing flawlessly. "

ricardusloganius,"May 17, 2012","This isn't too bad!  I find that for me the 0.7 is the best formula of
smoothness and boldness. I ordered this one as a curiosity to see how the famous
Jetstream series would handle itself in this tip size.  I purposely tried this
on CHEAP paper.  No fancy journals or notebooks for me!  It did fine!  I found
that if I wrote with less pressure than normal this one wrote almost as nicely
as the 0.7 variety.  Your mileage may vary, but it worked for me!  I now have a
smaller tipped pen I can use as needed that's nearly as smooth as the 0.7."
zephyr.rz,"March 21, 2012","I always have to keep a good stock of these with me. I write in a fairly small script and interchangeably in English and Japanese, so
a reliable 0.5 mm like this is a must. I actually picked up my first one of
these in Japan and when I got back to the states I couldn't find them anywhere,
so I was lucky to find this site. This pen is perfect for small pads of paper and journals. I'm usually pretty
rough with these things, but they hardly ever gunk (just clean up the tip if it
does), and the tips are pretty sturdy. However, you'll want to avoid using this
pen on a single sheet of paper, or on a hard or rough surface because the tip
will break after a while. You'll notice when it does because the writing will
start to get scratchy and the flow will thin up and become streaky. Since the
entire pen is plastic, those'll break after a while too, but like I said I'm
pretty rough with them and on average, a pen lasts me 3-5 refills. PROS:High durability and long life for its price range.0.5mm tip with reliable flow (perfect for journals, scribbles, small notes,
writing in Japanese). CONS:If you're going to be working more with thin pieces of paper without any backing
(writing on receipts etc.) keep a 0.7 or 1.0mm roller or gel handy so you don't
run down the life of your pen tip."

my friends and they also said it was best."

into my bucket of failed pens. After a bit of note taking in my economics class,
the ink started flowing real smooth and it wasn't skipping so I guess it just
took some warming up to get the ink going.I love this pen and use it for all of my note taking now. It's precise and
doesn't blot either, it's great for writing and drawing. The ink is a nice
saturated black too. It's a definite staple in my pencil case now."

kellz0rs,"April 13, 2011","I just received this pen today and I am in LOVE! :) I am a student, so I need to
take legible notes in classes where I cannot type them onto my Mac. I also write
in cursive, which makes reading tiny notes on handouts very difficult with a fat
pen, which is what spurred me to try these smaller-pointed pens. The Jetstream
is unlike a normal ballpoint in that it writes wonderfully with smooth ink flow
and no skipping. The fact that it comes with refills is also a plus, as
disposable pens have always bothered me. I won't write with any ballpoint but
this one; highly recommended!"

my line of work (I am a resident and work in a hospital). The pen is wonderful
and best of all its not terribly expensive. I dont ever have any smearing or
bleeding. 0.7mm may be a little better for writing in medical records but my
personal preference is 0.5mm :). Cant go wrong with this one..."

ryan,"January 15, 2010","I love the Jetstream series from Uni-Ball.  They are very, very smooth when writing. I can write quite quickly and the ink
always stays even. It never runs dry or drops globs of ink like some pens.
Another great thing I have noticed is that the ink dries almost instantly. That
is a huge plus for Southpaws who tend to drag their hands across their writing.

shindasagatanasu,"September 2, 2009","I am quite pleased with this pen's quality, especially at such a cheap price.
The ink flows smoothly and the line is thin and nice. However, for those with
sloppy handwriting, I don't think this is the right pen due to the fact that
it's so smooth. As for me, I'm very pleased because I have fairly nice
penmanship and the pen glide over the paper well, despite the very sharp 0.5
point. There's practically no grip, it's just a very [VERY] thin layer of
rubber, but that's not a problem for me. I find the pen quite comfortable and I
have been able to even produce a nice ballpoint pen drawing from it without my
hand hurting at all [being an artist, my hand is quite sensitive to different
pressures and it starts hurting a lot if strained]. This pen is well worth the
money... so for someone looking for nice pens at a cheap price, this Jetstream
is very nice to have."
williamscaleba,"January 14, 2009","The build quality is solid; no shaking or rattling when in use. I appreciate the
thinner point of this pen and it handles the Jetstream ink well anyways. The pen
writes without resistance, yet the ink still looks like a ballpoint pen."
Jetpens shopper,"March 26, 2022","I love how thin it is but it's not as comfortable as I wanted it to be but still
good feeling. But the reason why I have this a 1 star is it keeps running out of
ink and then work normally. I can't journal or take notes with this because of
how sloppy the ink comes out. I was very sad because I waited a month for my
pens and stuff to arrive and my hopes were up for the jetstreaam. "
buyer,"March 6, 2022","I love this pen but only down side is that its always sold out and you get a
very low chance of getting one."
ILovePens,"March 2, 2022","This pen stinks! I wish I could upload a picture of the writing with it; its
hard to describe -- it skips when I write on post-its, but it pools when I write
on index cards. It smudges. How does this pen get the rave reviews, I don't
know, but no thank you.I was looking for a ballpoint pen with dark, saturated (color) ink, to write
with clearly and without ""skipping"" while I take notes quickly. I like
ballpoints for that because I want a little bit of ""drag"", to slow down a gel or
rollerball (but not as slow as a felt tip). My Z-Grip Zebra pens have the right feel, but some of the colors are not ""dark""
or saturated enough, including the black, so I was looking to get a richer
black. This was not it, despite it being at the top of all of JetPen's lists."

Joyce Maddox,"December 6, 2022","Lovely to draw with. Nice and lightweight. I love that I can use fountain pen
inks as well as waterproof comic inks, depending on what I want to do. This dip
pen is much less fussy and easier to clean than the flexible manga nibs/dip pens
that Jetpens also sells, although the tradeoff is almost no line variation,
since it's a fountain pen nib. I haven't found it to drip or blot at all so far.
A great tool. "
raymondsante7711,"October 21, 2022",Great way to write cursive with a dip pen. I find the Medium works best for me. 
the odyssean,"January 16, 2023","Perfect for testing inks.  The nib appears to be the same as those found on the
Metropolitan/Explorer/Prera/Penmanship/Kakuno, and writes a line like those as
well.  On fountain pen friendly paper (Maruman loose leaf) I could write in a
consistent, moderately wet (not too wet): ""The quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog"" three full times, with only the last five words in the third sentence
showing any dryness.  On cheap, very absorbent copy paper, I could only write
that sentence once, plus another four words. "
tleone,"January 7, 2023","Pretty disappointed.  Most of the ink end up on the nib where it won't make it
to the slit so you are lucky to get a few short words before you need to dip it.
 Also the Med nib is more like a Fine.  Overall, pretty useless for testing
fountain pen inks, IMO.  Stick with a glass dip pen."
francisco.ruiz17,"January 2, 2019","Definitely a beginners fountain pen set, all pens were rounded nibs, so no flex.
But a great starter set for anyone getting into them. Gives a good range of nib
size and ink colors along with the inks possibilities. If you already have
experience with fountain pens, would not recommend, unless for beginners. Personal favs from the set were the Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen
because of its easy use. Second would be the Monami Olika Fountain Pen because
of its similar characteristics to the Pilot Varsity, but its ink was my fav.
Very dark and pronounced. "
natassja.angela,"March 12, 2019","This review would have been five stars if not for one bad seed.  Monami Olika - one of my immediate favorites. It’s a fine nib but it almost
feel like a medium. I love the flow of the ink. I also love that it can take
different brands of cartridge refill. I can play around with the inks as I get
to know them.  Platinum Preppy - I bought two additional fountain pens because I just live how
they look and it’s pretty affordable, both the pen and cartridge.  Zebra Zensations - not bad for a disposable. I use this on an almost daily basis
at the office.  Pilot Varsity - pretty good for a disposable fountain pen. I prefer this to the
Zensation.  Pilot Petit1 - my favorite from the whole bunch. This was the last pen that
I’ve tried because it’s tiny so I didn’t think much of it. But boy, oh
boy, it is amazing! This pen writes the smoothest out of all of the sampler
pens.  Zebra V-301 - last and the very least. It’s less than $4 and I want to dump
this in the garbage if I didn’t value my hard earned money. This has caused me
the most frustration. On my first try, I was giving it a good shake for a couple
of minutes, and then nothing. I’ve given it another five minutes worth of
shaking. It finally gave me a line, and then I started to write actual words,
I’ve got one word out of it until it stopped writing again. No ink comes out
of it at all.  I wanted to return the V-301 but unfortunately, the pens are not returnable. I
did get an instruction from JetPens on how to clean a fountain pen, both basic
and advanced methods. I appreciate the tips but I don’t want to have to put
too much effort on a pen this price.  As I was disassembling the V-301 pen, I noticed that the ink was a little thick,
and almost not as runny as the other cartridges from the other brands. I decided
to give it a very good and hard shake. It finally wrote!!! I kept practice
writing with it and it’s nice when it works. But then it would stop writing
again until I give it another good hard shake. It’s a stop and go with this
one. I do not recommend the V-301 at all. "
macscatha,"November 24, 2018","I enjoyed this sampler pack because of the ability to try each pen side by side.
There are also different sized nibs which is extremely important. For instance,
I had thought that I would need a medium nib because that's what I use in a
ballpoint pen, but I found the extra fine was my preferred nib.So a lot of options for not a whole lot of money, perfect for someone exploring
fountain pens for the first time."
MGSPens,"May 19, 2019","I loved all the fountain pens but both Zebras. The non-refillable was extremely
flimsy, and the other zebra fountain pen leaked uncontrollably and wrote worse
than any other pens I ever used in my life. It wrote extremely rough and the ink
clogged and then bursted onto the paper. Even when I didn't use it, it leaked
very severly. I would not recommend to buy this set, but rather, buy all the
fountain pens except the zebras."

not yet impressed.       Zebra V301  -  This is an incredibly                   
                                                                                
               beautiful writing instrument, and I'm in love with the finer
point. Unfortunately, I cannot get it to write for more than a scribble at a
time.  There you have it; I'm glad to have had the opportunity to sample these
products.  Even more so, I'm glad to supply my experiences.  Thanks for the
prompt delivery and for giving me this opportunity to comment."
phyllisgriffith,"September 23, 2019","I chose to buy a beginner set because although I have used many fountain pens in
my life, it's been about 15 years since that was so.  The only pen that I would
not buy again is the Zebra Stainless Steel.  I had to put a lot of labor into
the pen initially just to get it to write, but the flow of ink was never steady
and after 2 days of struggle with it I just gave up.  The other pens are
wonderful, and my daughter has stolen the Olika for her own personal use.  : )"
RamenFrog,"September 21, 2019","My experience with fountain pens is very limited so this was essentially my
first attempt to break into this particular line.The Zebra Zensations wrote a bit scratchy and was very particular about its nib
placement.  You'd either get great lines or have the ink come in and out with
flow.  I also had to put some pressure into the nib to maintain a strong line (I
have arthritis in my hands so they're not exactly athletic).I had similar issues with the Olika, however the ink is much bolder.  I ran into
less of that scratchy appearance and more into a thicker line.  I also
appreciated the fact it had a soft rubber grip for your fingers, so I'd argue
it's the most comfortable to hold out of the set.Platinum Preppy had a good flow with a thin line requiring little pressure.  It
also looks the most ""expensive"" pen in my opinion with the materials and styling
used.Petite Pilot won the contest of best pen for me.  It didn't care too much about
nib placement, nice bold lines, and perfect flow while having to barely touch
the paper.  If there's one negative for other people, the pen is very small (my
ring size is a 4 and a half and it just barely fits comfortably in my hand for
long writing sessions).  People with larger hands may find using this
troublesome.Lastly, the Pilot Varsity felt similar to the Plat Preppy, though it tended to
be a bit more particular with nib placement.I also received 3 ink cartridge replacements as well (one for the 301, lot good
that will do me).  For experienced fountain pen users, this is a hard pass as
none of the nibs have flexibility and is just to get a ""feel"" for how these pens
work for lesser writers.For people looking to get into fountain pens, this is a good place to start.  Be
wary of the Zebra 301, upon looking at its product page, it seems like I'm not
the only one having problems getting it to write properly."
awatkins195,"June 14, 2019","I am not a beginner wen it come to fountain pens. Have been using them for
decades big name pens. I saw this sampler and was curious. I got the sampler and
was quite impressed with them. The fine writing and feel with each pen had my
fingers floating on paper. I love everything about them. The quality of two pens
was good to believe they are disposable pens. The others are unique in their own
way. Have found a new home in quality pens."
Quichi,"April 28, 2019","I wrote an individual review on each pen. Overall the sampler is a decent value.
It would be nice if it were a little less expensive, I think the savings over
buying each individual pen is only about a dollar. But that's about normal for
JetPens. I look forward to seeing another fountain pen sampler which is not the
standard rounded ballpoint esque fountain pens."

pack as well."
vantolak,"October 6, 2022","The pens were all great and wrote easily and beautifully with the exception of
the Zebra V-301. That pen wouldn't write. It had a bit of felted fabric that did
get ink in it, but nothing was going to the nib's tip. The box only said ""insert
[cartridge] until you hear the click"" then ""give a few shakes to start the ink
flow"". I did those; nothing. I thought the felted material was dust and tried to
pull it out. It wasn't dust. And now the pen won't write. This was user
confusion turned user error. Don't make my mistake!"
whitedoyle,"October 2, 2022","I liked most of the pens, the pilot petite did not load properly an ink was
everywhere leaking, the Zebra V-301 does not write consistently and skips alot. 
"
daley.pear,"September 22, 2022","Ok so my current ranking of the pens in this bundle, as a newcomer to the
fountain pen world:1. Platinum Preppy - super smooth, a bit juicy, my fave of the bunch2. Pilot Varsity - not quite as smooth as the Preppy, but close3. Zebra Zensations - a noticeable jump in scratching/feedback, but not
unpleasant. The more I use it the more I like it. 4. Pilot Petite - the blackest ink of the bunch, quite juicy, slightly more
scratch than Zebra disposable, probably due to the finer nib. 5. Zebra metal thing - a piece of shit that refuses to write. I would happily
use any of the others but one refused to write until I diluted the ink, and
still only works if it is nearly vertical. "

nervous to let my brother's kids (ages 11 and 7) try out the pens, but they did
so well with the mini that I was impressed!  I'm buying more minis specifically
to give away.  I'm not sure I'd buy any of these again for myself, but it really
helped me get an idea of what I like in a fountain pen."

NuPenGeek,"August 31, 2021","I'm enjoying so far, as a novice beginner to fountain pens at age 41. Only
complaint I have is that items arrived in a padded but flexible envelope, so one
of the Zebra disposable ones, the cap had come off in the mail, and it did blot
the invoice a bit, but seemed to dry out quickly enough in the hot, arid
weather. It did come back quickly with a quick dab in water, and works well now.
However, the adhesive label on the cap is annoying. I removed it with solvent,
and of course that bleached the plastic of the cap, so it's not a pretty one,
but wasn't really much of one to begin with. Not sure if the label came from
Zebra or JetPens. I wish they'd have used a box, and assume they would for
higher value orders. Still, enjoying my stuff! I'm sure I'll be a repeat
customer."

jokar620,"July 1, 2021","I gave it a three because two of the pens were unable to work and one stripped

favorite pen is the FP V301 (Zebra)    So, this was a good buy to be able to find one I like."
dknitterof5,"June 23, 2021","Unbelievable all these nice pens for an affordable price.   I have such a hard
time making a decision on just one-it was great to be able to purchase a few to
see what I like before I invest in something more expensive.  My favorite of the
bunch is actually the Platinum Preppy in the Medium 05.  Came in Blue which is a
beautiful color.  The others were all black and mostly fine nibs.  I have used
the Pilot Varsity before and still find the medium tip-finer than I like. 
Thanks Jet Pens.  I'm hooked now."

Alex Florez,"May 1, 2021","This pack is about 50/50 for me. The disposable pens are... well disposable. The
Zebra Zensations is aiming itself for the trash bin with its constant skipping,
and the Pilot Varsity is nothing to write home about (or with). The Zebra V 301 was a surprisingly decent experience. Not my favorite of the
bunch, but a lot better than I the reviews let on. I already own an arsenal of Pilot Petit (Fountain, Brush, and Marker), and they
are probably my favorite line of pens ever. When I found out the marker and
brush had been discontinued I was heartbroken, but managed to find a seller
elsewhere and bought two full sets of each color and enough refills to last me
the next 10 years or so. These are not only super cute, but write really well,
are conveniently tiny, but long enough with the cap on the end to feel like a
full sized pen. The blue black has been my go-to pen for almost ten years when I
had otherwise gone dormant on using fountain pens. Worth the price of the whole
set. I think the Platinum Preppy and I are going to get along great. I've only tested
it briefly (unsealed eyedropper fill, I need to get gaskets). Writes nice and
smooth and can hold a full syringe worth of ink. Not a single drop leaked into
the screw threads, but I don't wish to tempt fate. I think I'll be buying a lot
more of these and using them for testing out new bottles of ink."

to all my expectations.  I do hate their ink cartridge, but take a look at the
JetPens Ink Syringe (which I bought with this set) and you can keep refilling
the cartridge with your own ink for years to come."

lomo1968,"March 19, 2019","Okay, so I purchased these, by accident in black, but that's okay, that was my
fault.I gave the Zebra one to my older sister, so I can only review the other four I
received.They all write well. I of course pulled out all of my various paper. They write
well on cardstock, Japanese writing paper found on this website, Strathmore
paper, HP LASER paper 32lb white, and the ink did not smear in any of the tests.
Now, I did use cards I purchased elsewhere and the paper was shiny and they did
not stick to that, which I didn't think it would, but I had to try so I could
give my honest review. The cards used, only a Sharpie marker, not the thin ones,
can be used on these certain cards.Two are non-refillable, but this was fine because these are for trial. Overall, I will be purchasing some of these again. I may try them in purple,
which I meant to choose originally so I can see how these write. I have run
across some that are fine in one color, but not in another. Go figure."

InkToPaper,"January 14, 2023","Okay, so I spent some effort adjusting my writing to the pen. You have to press
harder than I would like, and it is broad, but it has to be said, this is simply
the most elegant, professional, beautiful, functional pen. Perhaps it’s worth
pressing a bit?"
InkToPaper,"January 10, 2023","This could be so good if the refills were better. The ink colours it comes with
are among the nicest I've seen in ballpoints. But they are too broad and have
consistent hard starts for all the colours.Still looking for D1 refills. The gel inks (Zebra) are too light in colour for
my taste. Perhaps Pilot's ballpoint refill might change that."
ADR in NY,"March 23, 2020","Neglected to include this in my earlier review... because of its pendulum weight
component, the refills rattle within the pen while retracted. If it had been any
other writer, I would probably find myself not using it as often. The look and
feel of this pen overshadows any feelings I have about the sound heard. This is
an absolutely beautiful pen."

jaasum,"February 19, 2021","Excellent compact pen, and I love the gravity-based mechanism for switching

ADR in NY,"March 23, 2020","The style of this pen is awesome. Very simplistic in design but screams
professional. Love that the two parts of the pen screw together seamlessly.
Selecting an ink color is not complicated. If you're having trouble, this link
(https://www.jetpens.com/blog/the-lamy-2000/pt/349) will take you to JetPen's
Lamy 2000 page where you'll find simple instructions. The ink is subpar. My
suggestion: fill it with Jetstream's D1 hybrid ink refills. I find that the 0.5
mm is perfect for me. Excellent writing instrument!"

mizabecker,"February 14, 2018","A good testing ground for finding the right nib for Spencerian script! These are
all good nibs, especially the Brause 66 (tiny one) & Blue Pumpkin, the Speedball
with the larger bowl, & the Leonardt. The fingerpointing one & the Nikko G's are
a bit stiff - and how can you call this a sampler of ""eight"" when three nibs
(the Nikko) are all the same, hmm? Those are supposed to be the be-all, end-all
of all things pointed pen, but for writing, I just don't feel it; they gouge at
paper that isn't like watercolor thick. But the verdict isn't terrible; there
are the ones mentioned - all fine, flexible, good ink-holding examples of just
what I was looking for!"
reallygoodsuzie,"May 16, 2018","I've bought these nibs with the Speedball Oblique Pen Nib Holder and I've
definitely got more than what I've expected. I'm still having a fun time testing
each nibs and it has definitely helped me discover what I like best, how I use
it, and where. I would recommend others to try. "
cdnrn60,"June 18, 2018",I'm a rookie calligrapher. This is a great way to sample a selection of nibs.
jNYc,"November 19, 2017","A great sampler of nibs if you’re interested in getting involved with dip pens
and calligraphy. "
wrathandwriting,"September 2, 2022","Whenever I start a new project I always go all in which is why all of these nibs
in the sampler has a holder so I can switch back and forth when I want to lol.
If you are a beginner like me give yourself some time and the nibs to be
comfortable using them. Angle of the pen and your body really is important so
make sure you go through some tutorials. I finally got the angle of my arm
perfectly to work with the blue pumpkin and I see why everyone loves it. I would
love to see more handpicked samplers from you guys"
butterchezmc,"November 29, 2022",Worth it. Came in great shape with eachcnib individually wrapped.
geisk,"October 15, 2022","I love these nibs! I bought them to learn calligraphy and I'm getting
progressively better. They're inexpensive, yet high quality. I recommend these
nibs."
Myrima,"June 20, 2022","It’s a great set to try different sizes/materials. I was pleasantly surprised
the pointing finger worked best for the current calligraphy inks I am using. I
initially thought it was a gimmick. I’m happy I bought the set. "
ksgarvin,"May 20, 2022","A fun collection of nibs and a great way to try different styles without having
to buy each nib type separately. My favorites are the Brause 29 Index Finger
(who would not like this?) and the Brause 361 Steno Blue. Speedball has always been a great performer for me. The No. 101 and No. 512 are
finer than the Brause nibs in this collection (even the 66 Extra Fine) and are
good for detail work. The Nikko Comic is also a fine nib.All of these are good products and perform well. It's a matter of personal
choice and the ink/paper you're using that will determine which is the best for
the project at hand. But you can't go wrong here."
Laura,"January 14, 2022","I had a lot of fun trying these out even though I lack any skill at all with
these nibs. I love the looks of the Blue Pumpkin but that didn't help me employ
it any better, sadly. The wise inclusion of the G-nib helped make up for all of
that though! LOL - I can do something halfway decent maybe with one of those. Do
note that a couple of the nibs are extra small so you should make sure you have
a holder that can accommodate those smaller nibs."
analanderos8,"March 1, 2021","This was a good starter set for pointed pen calligraphy beginner. Each nib is
unique and has different qualities. The 3 Nikko G nibs are especially good to
start out with. I like that there were three in the set. The Brause blue pumpkin
is also another recommended nib because it holds a good amount of ink. The price
was good for this set of nibs. These can be used with a straight or oblique pen
holder. I recommend this set. "
catie24,"April 16, 2020","Great starter kit for calligraphy nibs! Though be aware, there are a variety of
sizes so you may need more than one nib holder. But really fun for learning dip

it in my hand all day long. It's very worth it."
austin,"December 25, 2013","This is an amazing pen!  I bought it over a year ago and I still have it!  I
love it.  The jetstream ink is of quality that you would expect, but what makes
me love this pen also is the fact that it snuggly fits energel refills.  I have
used a blue 05 energel refill in this pen, and it writes amazingly, so if you
ever want to switch up writing feel while using the same pen body, you could try
fitting energel refills in this pen.  When I write, I hold my pens close to the tip, with the pen vertical at almost
90 degrees to the paper, and only pinky side of my wrist touching the paper. 
The thumb side of my wrist is far from the paper.  Thus, the grip on this pen is
a bit too far from the tip to suit me personally.  If you write with the pen at
an angle and with your fingers further from the tip, this is a great pen for
you, however, you cannot fully benefit from the alpha gel grip if you grip the
pen close to the tip like I personally do.  "
myad89343,"October 27, 2020","I love this pen. The weight and the soft grip are both very nice. A lot of
people complain about the ink that it comes with. I personally do not like
ballpoint pens, so I replaced the cartridge with the 0.5 needle tip pentel
energel cartridge as soon as I received the pen. The pentel energel ink is by
the far the best I have used and putting it into the pen body makes an
incredible pen. I highly recommend doing this if you prefer gel pens over
ballpoint. "
davidmulcair,"March 19, 2012","Not impressed.  Writing quality is what I expected from a jetstream.  Metal is
quite light and somewhat cheap feeling for the price.  The white plastic near
the clicker has come unhinged in four weeks of daily business use, and sometimes
the clicker gets jammed.  I don't recommend this pen. "
soschlow,"October 13, 2011","This pen is GLORIOUS! Of course the grip is incredible, the finish is gorgeous,
and it has a nice weight to it. One thing to note however is that the clip
design has changed from the above pictures, the clip on mine is mounted at the
very end of the barrel, allowing whatever you clip the pen onto to travel the
full length of the clip. It is easier to clip while still being secure as well."
kyafuso7,"May 17, 2010","Gel pens are great to write with because of their smoothness but, as a left
handed writer, I cannot use most gel pens because they smear all over. However,
I no longer envy right handed writers because of this pen. The Jetstream line
has a remarkable ink flow that makes writing extremely smooth. In fact, this pen
writes smoother than most gel pens! And did I mention that this is a ballpoint
pen! I highly recommend this pen to all writers and especially to lefties. In
addition, the grip is as you would expect from the alpha gel line-soft, cushy
and heavenly. While the price of this pen is quite high, you get two great
things in one pen-a terrific grip, and a unrivaled ink flow. In addition, the
metal body of this pen makes it durable, so when the ink runs out, you can just
buy a refill and use it for years."
amanda,"October 1, 2015","This is probably my new favorite pen - it's the closest I've found to the sadly
discontinued Zebra Airfit Jell. Soft squishy grip, smooth writing. I have small
hands and would like if the grip went closer to the tip, but it's still very
comfortable. Also, it's not cheap looking exactly, but not quite as nice as you
would hope for a pen that costs 3x as much as the Airfit did."
blmyers1984,"May 3, 2010","I am a pen freak and love the jetstream line! This pen is no different and is
much better than even the best jetstream pen. The grip is great and the ink is
what you would expect from this line! Writes every time you put it to paper and
is very comfortable in the process. Stop thinking about it and order this pen!
You won't be sorry."
margherital,"September 11, 2021","Gorgeous pen body. The grip is super comfortable and the metal body feels luxe
to write with. I ordered this in August 2021 to use with the Pentel Energel 0.5
Needle Tip refills and the pen body still fits them no problem."
jpechura,"April 10, 2021","I buy tons of products from Jet Pens. Jet Pens was my lifesaver during the
pandemic when many stores (office supply) like theirs were closed. So JET PENS
to the rescue!I buy fountain pens and roller balls and waterproof black ink pens to work in
watercolor and BRUSH pens galore! BUT I NEVER BUY BALLPOINT PENS because I just don't use them. However, this Uni
Jetstream caught my eye and after reading about it, I bought it for my husband.
Well, truth be told he has NOT seen it yet because I have not stopped using it
since it arrived. It's my everyday pen for my planner, my purse, my to do list,
my calendar, my oh my gosh, I might be doing ballpoint art one day soon! IT'S
SMOOTH - IT NEVER SKIPS - IT WRITES BEAUTIFULLY! I LOVE IT! I MUST BUY ANOTHER

princess cordelia,"June 29, 2020","super squishy grip, smooth ink, great pen in general. I love it."
TX Calligrapher,"July 12, 2017","My new favorite.  Like my other Jetstreams, but this one feels good in hand, a
little weight to write easier but not too much.  Is heaver than the Uni Premier
207.  Gel Grip helps with control and is brighter white, hoping it does not
discolor (yellowing) like the Premier 207 I have had for at least 5 years.  Clip
a little tight but seems it will loosen a bit with repeated use.  Clip is better
quality than the plastic attachment on the Premier 207. "
alex,"January 20, 2017","Love everything about this pen and as a jetstream pen, writing is always smooth
and it never skips. (The grip is pretty white and opaque in person compared to
the picture in which it looks slightly transparent but personally I prefer it
this way)"
brycefan,"March 7, 2010","Very nice pen. The grip is very identical to the Alpha Gel Tint grip, but with
the color a little stronger. But let me say, the body of this pen is amazing. It
looks a little wooden-like and the grip even adds to it's smoothness. Combined
with the awesome Jetstream pen, this pen is the best ever."

than a few words in years. I recently started journaling and was finding a lot

gamergal59455,"August 5, 2020","I write a lot of notes, so I was looking for a pen that was comfortable to hold.
This pen did that perfectly! On top of that, the ink was smooth and didn't
smudge. One downside to this pen would probably be that it's a little heavy, due
to the majority of the body being metal. But that's mainly due to me only using
plastic pens, so if you're used to using pens that have a teensy bit more
weight, this shouldn't be an issue."
Noicepen,"July 17, 2020","I have a death grip when it comes to holding my pens. The gel makes it comfortable for me to write resulting in pretty handwriting. You are able to change the ink with energel refills, which was was one of the
reasons I bought this pen. However, the ink and its smoothness made me change my
mind. I generally prefer gel ink, but this ballpoint ink is perfect. "
B3cc4j3nn,"June 24, 2020","4.5/5. I LOVE that I finally have a Jetstream pen that the grip is nice and
sturdy (the standard pen grip becomes loose after a while, and I really don't
like writing with something that looks old). The only downside, is I'm not super
fond of the textured metal... it just feels a little weird, but I still love the
pen. The weight is very nice--I've never had a weighted barrel before so its
nice to experience one. I'm looking forward to using my .5 jetstream refills in
this! "

of the jetstream inks in general, but that's easy to fix because this versatile
pen takes my favorite Pentel Energel 0.4 refill. "
beanie,"February 11, 2019",so comfortable to use.  well made.
ADR in NY,"November 26, 2018","Good weight, the gel grip is comfortable, the brush metal gives it a sleek look,
and the hybrid ink is a great alternative to gel (darker than a ballpoint,
oil-based ink and smooth on paper). I agree with some reviews I've read that
said the gel grip being so far from the tip makes holding it somewhat
uncomfortable. It does feel like you're quite a distance from the tip. I believe
those that tend to grab closer to the tip may find this pen awkward to hold.
Still, a really great pen!"
modulo12,"September 9, 2018","An excellent pen marred by its refills. While it writes smoothly, and I've used it for years at this point, the refills
don't last long at all. This makes it very annoying to actually use over a long
period. Otherwise, the construction of this pen is great. I don't suffer from
the obnoxious hand cramps I usually get with most pens after a long period of
writing. If you're willing to put up with not so great refills, then go for it.
Otherwise, search for another pen."

bravosierramajor,"July 19, 2018","This is one of the best running and most comfortable pants that I have ever

dinokoutsoukos,"January 27, 2015","My new favorite pen. Everything that I'm looking for in a pen. None of that
typical ""warm-up tim"" that Uniball ballpoints usually need. Worth every penny!"
amirsgarbunk,"May 20, 2013","I've bought this pen for 3 different coworkers as a gift and they all absolutely
adore them.  I tend to dislike the jetstream ink because I have very broad,
slightly sloppy handwriting and the ease with which the jetstream ink flows
lends itself to my sloppy, big letters (I prefer a very fine-tip gel ink pen to
the ballpoints because they help me slow my chicken-scratch down.) 
Nevertheless, this pen is a hit around the office!  Writes fantastic and the
grip is super duper comfortable. I will note that one of the pens had a dodgy ink cartridge out of the box and
was basically not usable until I snagged a refill.  Luckily Jetpens rocks with
fast shipping and plenty of inventory."
chaotic.realm,"October 12, 2012","My pen was delivered early this morning and I have since been writing with it
all day. I'm very happy with my purchase. I was specifically looking for a pen that would write clearly and consistently
without requiring me to apply a lot of pressure because I'm kind of lazy when it
comes to handwriting. Likewise, since I am in school and spend a lot of time
writing throughout the day, I wanted something comfortable. This pen really
delivers in spades... I can write quickly and lightly with no half-formed
letters due to the pen not delivering ink, and the soft, squishy grip is
comfortable to boot. In short: this is a great pen... it looks sleek, feels sturdy, writes
beautifully, and the grip is very comfortable."
luv2shop29403,"July 30, 2010","OMG I luv this pen!  The Jetstream line has been my favorite for years marrying the bold color of a

office b/c I will fight for it, Lol! Another great addition to the Jetstream
family."
tonseventy,"September 22, 2008",i love this pen its soooooooooo the bomb
dfbldwn,"October 26, 2010","1) An outstanding fine point, perfect for making quick notes in margins or short
entries in my journal. I didn't know such a combination of fine line and smooth
consistent flow to paper was technically possible. This nib seems incapable of
skipping. Unlike the _EF_ nib in the Penmanship, which seems better suited for
finest detail and drawing, this nib can still be used for writing. 2) Maintains a fine line even on poorer paper, including newspaper crosswords,
when using Noodler's Black (warning: non-zero Nib Creep with this ink). 3) I even use it in handwriting practice as the finer line reveals errors in
letter shape that were (ahem) hidden using edged nibs or normally tip'd nibs. 4) I received it on 25 Oct 2010 and it came with two cartridges and one CON-20
converter. 5) Actual color is quite close to that of the last photograph showing pen and
cap adjacent to it. 6) The cap has magnets in it. Strong ones. I'll try to keep it a safe distance
from portable memory devices (USB flashdrives, camera memory cards) and my
digital watches and calculators. I waited several months for jetpens to restock this pen and it has proved well
worth the wait. This _F_ nib and its _M_ sibling are so good I'm compelled to take all our
Pelikans from Fahrney's Pens and put them up for sale."
kalex,"October 31, 2012","Oh, yes. This is a nice one!  Just right size, weight, balance (""posted"" cap or
not). Wrote beautifully, first time and every time since--without skipping,
hesitation or ""scratchiness."" NO adjustment of nib necessary, as I believe one
other reviewer reported. I'm a proud cheapskate, but my Prera was worth every
nickel of fifty bucks, as far as I'm concerned. As I've noticed with other Pilot
pens, too, (F)ine means FINE, *not* MEDIUM--thank you very much. I prefer a see-through converter (I'm surely not alone), so I popped out the
(included) CON-20 bulb-type converter and put a CON-50 screw-plunger-type in
there (only possible ""downside. I happened to have one already, otherwise it
would've been another $8.50). Inked it up with Diamine Imperial Blue (woo!) and
""went to town"" on some high-quality paper (Rhodia, Clairefontaine, Kokuyo
notebooks). The first thing I noticed was the incredible SMOOTHNESS. That was
the first ""Oh, yes."" It was palpable. FWIW, I'm sinistral. A ""normal-writing""
(""hook-less"") left-hander, too. You ""Captain Hooks"" know who you are (smile). My
Pilot Prera works *just beautifully* for me, and I'll bet right-handers will be
glad they bought one, too. ! I want at least one more myself, right away--in a
different barrel color. Did I mention just the tactilely(?) nice FEEL of the friction-fit of the cap
when you close it? The three metal rings (plus the top of the cap) make for a
nice design touch, too. The spring of the pocket clip is VERY strong (as another
reviewer may have noted.) Once you clip it onto something, it's not going
ANYPLACE. After reading in another review, I had to test it--and mine is NOT
MAGNETIC."
Sarah B,"March 17, 2011","I've had this pen for about a week now. I'm starting to like it a bit better -
for me, the nib was so fine that ink would not flow, so I finally slid a thin
sheet of plastic between the tines and spread them out just a tad and now it
writes well. The grey color is fine for work, and I am now using this pen as my
daily carry. It's very solidly constructed, and the lid is secure either capped
or posted. All hardware on the pen is solid. I may get another one."
troyes71,"October 18, 2010","Nice pen, stylish, lightweight. The Fine nib is much finer than the Lamy Safari
Extra Fine nib, and lays down an almost needle-like line. It writes and draws
better on a smooth 65lb or less paper. On heavier paper with a bit of texture,
the nib will feel slightly dry and scratchy."
faieonline,"November 30, 2008","I bought this pen to be used for sketching, and I'm glad I did. The nib is fine
enough to draw little details, and it writes smoothly. It is a bit too
lightweight for my taste, though. Paired with a waterproof ink such as Noodler's
Bulletproof black, it will make a good drawing pen for artist, which will be
economical in the long run. And like the previous reviewer wrote, I love the
'click' sound this pen makes when I cap it."
bradgad,"April 29, 2017","My Favorite PenI have three high-end Pilot fountain pens: a Falcon SEF, a Custom Heritage 91
SF, and a Custom 823 F. They are all wonderful pens. No complaints. Match them
with the right ink, and they just sing in your hand and on the page.But, this modest little Prera F in slate grey loaded with Pilot Blue Black ink
is my favorite pen. I use it every day. A lot. I recently went to a pen show and
had a nibmeister work on my Custom Heritage 91 SF. I asked her to try to get it
to write like this Prera. She improved it, but I still use my Prera every day in
my journal and any time I need a pen to take with me. It's a relatively dry writer... I like that; you may not. It doesn't have the bouncy responsiveness on the page as something like the
Falcon or a Pilot soft nib. It's not a nail, quite, but don't expect the
liveliness you will get from a gold nib. The Prera uses the same ""Super Quality"" steel nib as the Metropolitan, and it's
interchangeable with the Penmanship and the Plumix as well. Two thoughts about
that... 1) Since I have a total of nine Preras and Metropolitans (as well as two
Penmanships and one Plumix), I can say this: they're all good but they're not
all the same. The smoothest nib I own (including high-end pens of several
brands) is one that originally came on a Metropolitan. The others are smooth but
not *that* smooth. Two of the nine have noticeable but not unpleasant feedback.
So, if you go for a Prera but don't just love how it writes, consider getting a
Metropolitan (or two or three) and swap nibs as desired. Which leads to... 2)
It's not as easy and cheap as the interchangeable nibs you get with something
like the Lamy Safari/Al-star/Vista/etc., but these are better pens and being
able to swap nibs around is a dandy thing.(I don't know why, but regardless of how you swap nibs, Preras tend to write
drier than Metropolitans.)It's a wonderfully handy size to carry around. It's a nothing in a dress shirt
pocket, and the design of the clip makes it so won't get sprung if you put it in
a pants pocket with a heavy seam like with jeans or Carhartts. Even though it's
a relatively small pen, it's very comfortable for extended writing. (Kinda gotta
post it though. I prefer to write posted with everything except my 823, so
that's not a down-check for me.)The CON-50 is a very good converter, works great, and on JetPens.com the Prera
comes with one (as well as being about $20 cheaper than you'll find it
elsewhere). The capacity is small, yes, but the Prera is a dry pen, so a fill
lasts a couple days at least... I usually get three or four days from a fill. The feel of the cap snapping on and off is lovely... like closing the door on a
Mercedes or Beemer.On most sites in the U.S., I would say the Prera is somewhat overpriced compared
to the Metropolitan. On JetPens.com, it's not: it's a steal. "
craig,"May 5, 2012","This was my first fountain pen of significant cost, and one that I'd been
looking forward to for months, since shortly after getting interesting in
fountain pens. Having realised that I prefer/need pens that produce a fairly
fine line (much finer than most average pens) I had hight hopes for this pen,
and I wasn't disappointed. The Prera is a nice looking pen. Nothing outlandish and fairly conventional, and
it won't win any ""wow that's cool looking"" from most who see it, but it's
stylish and neat, and I find it looks fairly attractive. It's comfortable to
hold, smooth to write with (at least on decent paper) and puts down a line that
I would say it just a little on the wet side, though that may depend on how you
use it. So far I think it's a great pen, and I've found it to suit me very well. If you
want a fountain pen that writes a nice fine line, this it an excellent place to
start."
rankkaapina,"March 23, 2022","This was a bit of an impulse buy. I was listening to old Pen Addict episodes
where Brad Dowdy was raving about Pilot Preras. And I saw this and thought, I'll
try. I was not disappointed. Unassuming pen, but it has become a favorite. Maybe
even over my Retro Pop Metropolitans (and I do love those colors...). The size
of the pen fits well in my small hands and the writing is just so smooth and
effortless. Great value for the money!"
Marshjor1882,"February 26, 2022","What a lovely pen. Body and cap display great build quality, a step above the
Metropolitan despite being plastic. Cap snaps on securely in a very satisfying
manner. The pen is quite small but usable unposted and comfortable when posted.
I've found my go-to workhorse."
littlesquirrelrk,"August 11, 2021","LOVE LOVE LOVE this pen, and what a great value.  Writes beautifully, smoothly,
the nib glides and is not scratchy when writing, and it looks great too.  Very
satisfied with the Prera."
Archimom,"June 11, 2021","Preras are my favorite day to day pen.  I have previously only purchased preras
with M nibs, but this time I decided to branch out with an F nib.  I am very
happy with my purchase.  I love preras because they are lovely to write with,
have a tension fit nib and feed that is easy to clean if you use a difficult
ink, the diameter of the barrel is big enough for a comfortable grip, the grip
area is smooth and comfortable if you write for a long time, and best of
all—the snap on cap is robust enough that after at least 8 years of use on my
oldest Preras, I have had no problems.  Take that Lamy safari!"
richardjkelleyjr,"October 12, 2019","This is an excellent pen. I have numerous high end pens but I always seem to go
back to this simple yet elegant, buttery smooth pen."
drrdhunt,"January 9, 2018","This is a replacement pen. My first pen was chewed by my puppies. I love the way
the Prera writes. It is smooth and glides right over the paper. "
theundergroundninja,"March 4, 2015","I have a Lamy Safari and love it.  Little did I know this would be THAT much
better.  It writes like a dream and is a sharp looking pen.  The writing line is
clean with no globs and the black ink is very dark on the page.  My favorite
part of this pen is the click when closing the cap; it is so satisfying.Downsides are minor: it's smaller than I expected.  I have big hands so it just
looks puny in my hands.  Especially coming from the Lamy.  I also miss the
window from my Lamy showing the ink level.  I know it would likely ruin the
design of the pen but it's a nice convenience nonetheless.  Neither are worth
deducting a star."
romevi86,"May 22, 2014","My first fountain pen. When I first entered the world of fountain pens I wanted something relatively
inexpensive. I researched different makers, and settled on this one instead of
the German-made Safari. I have tiny handwriting, so I deduced that Japanese
fountain pens will suit me well. When I got the pen I found that, while the nib certainly was fine enough for my
teensy handwriting, the nib was pretty scratchy, and didn’t make for a good
workhorse pen. It’s a fine pen, just not for me. Over the years I’ve discovered which pens work and which pens don’t for me.
I ended up getting the Safari anyway and I love it. I have an EF nib on it, and
it’s a good everyday pen. My favorite brand is Sailor, mostly for their
outstanding nibs and range. I also have an Esterbrook which I love, as well as a
custom Nakaya."
bnddir,"December 26, 2022","I am new to the fountain pen community but honestly, I LOVE THIS PEN! Good
feedback through it's fine smooth nib, writes a tad bit on the wet side which I
prefer, and feels good in the hand. Posts well and the cap secures audibly.
Can't wait to order it in a different color with a medium nib just to see if I
enjoy something broader. Great EDC pen. Thanks JetPens!"
PaperTrails,"December 18, 2022","I love the Preras, so much so that I already bought three and am waiting for
more.  I wish they would come out with more colours in this opaque body, as well
as a version that is longer when uncapped and un-posted.This is the only pen I use posted, and the way the cap clicks shut is so lovely
that it’s hard to explain (who would have thought that such a small detail
makes such a difference?).The nib is super smooth and I have to say that I always struggle in choosing
between the Medium and Fine when buying a particular colour of the pen (I own
both nib sizes, for reference).  The ink you use will of course also make a
difference.Right now I’m trying out a Pilot Iroshizuku ink in this Fine nib version and
am amazed by this combination even more than with the other inks I have in my
other Preras.  I have yet to test if this is to do with the property of this one
particular ink or if it’s just a match made in heaven with all Iroshizuku inks
and Pilot Preras.There’s no hesitation needed when buying this pen.  Just be sure to buy a
converter at the same time.I hope you love your pen as much as I love mine."
Shlok Shah,"December 3, 2022","Absolutely adore this pen. The fine nib is smooth, accurate, and thin. The size
is perfect for quick notes when unposted or longer sessions when posted. The
slate gray color looks so good. Should absolutely be in everyone's arsenal."
foxdenfarms7,"September 7, 2022","Awesome pen. Same pen as the clear ones with colored accents. Have the slate
grey and the ivory. Well worth the price once you start writing with them. "

joananderson.art,"August 9, 2022","I have two other Preras, each with a medium nib. I got the fine point for
drawing, but find I really like it for writing. "
Reviewer,"July 4, 2022","Love this pen. Smooth writing experience, can be dismantled completely for
thorough cleaning. The way the pen cap snaps on is my favorite thing about this

O won several in different colors so I can fill them with different color inks."
Kate,"December 3, 2021","This pen is TINY. It feels ridiculously small in my hands, it’s awkward to use
unless the cap is posted…which I don’t prefer to do. It’s also very
lightweight. Overall not what I was hoping for. "

crackerjack_10,"August 2, 2017",Simple fountain pen but a pleasure to write with. 
novaluna,"February 12, 2017","Bought as a gift for my husband.  I knew he would want a ultra fine nib, the
convenience of cartridges and a style that could go from work meetings to his
grad studies note taking.  The Prera is a solid fit for all of those things. 
I'm not a huge Japanese extra fine nib fan but it love how this one writes.  The
body seems solidly constructed for the price.He seems very happy with it and I'll be adding one to my own collection soon."
Sarah I,"July 3, 2016","I'm fairly conflicted about this pen. The nib is reliable and the pen feels
pleasant in the hand. While it is not a luxury item by any means, it is a solid
choice for every day. The problem is that it seems a little over priced
(although I still have two). "
mwrasp,"March 4, 2016","The pen is great.  It is well made for the price.  My only gripe is that it is
TINY.  Make sure you do some research so that you understand what you will be
getting relative to your hand size.  This pen must be posted so that it doesn't
feel ridiculous.  Having said that the pen puts down a consistent very fine
line.  The nib is top notch!  I only wish that the pen was 3 cm longer.  "
terryodoyle,"February 23, 2016",Superior pen
kitty nydc,"August 20, 2015","I've purchased two of these pens and enjoy writing with them. I prefer a fine
nib for taking short notes through the workday and writing longer notes and
letters when necessary.  They write smooth and only occasionally get too much
ink in the nib.  Cleaning and changing the ink is simple. I would suggest them
for anyone who loves changing up their writing instruments frequently and who is
looking to get into using fountain pens. "
PenPaperWorker,"June 13, 2015","This has been a fantastic pen. Keep in mind that Japanese nibs are finer than
European nibs, and this is a very fine writer indeed. Despite the fine nib, it
exhibits no scratchiness, and ink flow is perfect. I might have lucked out, as
my other more expensive Pilot pens have not been so nice, but something to note.
Then pen looks fantastic, and avoids some of the faux luxury tackiness I see in
other pens. You probably want to buy a con-50 converter. It's not included. Oh, one more
thing. It's kind of expensive on Jetpens. Just note the prices on other sites,
because I would say it's more than what you might find elsewhere."

go wrong with this pen."
karinawiser,"December 20, 2012","This is a true fine nib pen. EXCELLENT in all regards. The feel and weight in
your hand is incredible. I did have a little scratch at first, but after rinsing it with slightly soapy
water, it behaves like magic. Very nice fine line. I do recommend a converter
with it - it writes much-much better than with catridge."
romevi86,"September 12, 2012","This was my first Japanese fountain pen, and a great introductory pen at that.
Unfortunately, I didn't like it after a while, but that may be because I was
soon spoiled by Sailor and Estie pens, not to mention other higher quality
fountain pens. I do recommend it since it's a fantastic starter pen at a low
price, but don't go expecting to be blown away by it."
nealclayton,"February 23, 2012","This is a nice little pen.  The gray color is leaning toward blue.  J. Herbin's
Bleu Nuit is an excellent ink for this pen.    "
beverlytuazon,"February 10, 2012","Smooth & Fine! Just what I was looking for. I favor the Japanese standard for
Fine (this writes finer than the German Lamy & Kaweco Extra Fine nibs). This is
my new favorite pen. The size and weight are small and light, which is also what
I prefer. The pen width and grip is comfortable. The cap is airtight & has a
soft click to it. And I love the classy Slate Gray color! I just may get another
one in a different color...Like the other reviewer mentioned the ink output on my pen was originally very
light so I also spread the tines ever so slightly with a plastic report cover
and the flow is perfect now."
parsifalsSister,"October 1, 2011","This is my second Prera, and I like it as much as the first.  It fits in the
hand like the right sized glove, writes and writes and draws and draws a fine
line (approx. 03 when compared to others) and is well balanced.   It is light weight and small, but it is just perfect for a pocket, bag or pen
case and offers you a great writing experience at half the price of many of the
fountain pens on the market--and way up scale from the Penmanship, another pen I
favour."

I want a Stella 90!"

ranchoaguja,"November 1, 2020","I am on a quest to find to blue-black gel pens and thought I had hit the holy
grail with your sampler - but they are all fine point!! I want a fairly broad
point (.7mm+), anything less and my writing appears ""spidery"".Great website."
Clifton R,"October 23, 2020","This was a fantastic sampler and a great buy, particularly if you're trying to
find a new favorite pen. I had intended to get the similar black pen sampler but
it sold out shortly before I ordered so I went for this instead, and then bought
a few pens not in this sampler in black to round it out.I now have a bunch of new favorites in various degrees of line thickness and
feel.Nearly all these pens were very smooth writers, and 7 out of the 10 easily beat
my former favorite pens, the Uniball Micro and similar Uniball Onyx Micro
rollerball pens. I guess I won't be buying those any more.The Uniball Signo DX 0.38 is the one I find myself using the most so far, and I
think is my overall favorite, but the Pentel Energel Clena, Pilot High-tec C
0.4, Pilot Juice-up 04, and Zebra Ballsign 0.4 are all nearly equally pleasant
to write or draw with. The two finest line pens - Uniball RTI 0.28 and Zebra Sarasa Clip 0.3 - both
felt a little scratchy, but of the two the Zebra Sarasa Clip 0.3 had a better
feel and an equally fine line. The only ones I really don't see myself using are
the Uniball Style Fit - it's too thin to grip comfortably, and skips just a
little bit as I write with it - and the Flexion, because I don't want anything I
write in pen to be erasable. The Style Fit would make a great emergency backup
pen though, as it could be tucked in nearly anywhere given how tiny it is; I
think I'll leave it in my car."

andrew.t.leonard,"March 7, 2020","This was a very fun pack to test out. My favorite was the Pilot Juice Up. It has
the same tip size but different tip style (needle?) than the Energel Clena which
I thought would be my favorite since I’ve had several Energels in the past and
loved them all (Energel was my 2nd favorite overall). The Juice Up light weight
body feel and the amazing flow is making me love the experience for longer
writing sessions. My least favorite was either the Sarasa Clip or Sakura Ballsign. I wanted to
like them so badly but the scratchiness of the tips took away from the writing
experience. I found if I pressed very lightly it got better. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the Uni Style Fit. I thought Jet Pens made
a mistake and shipped me a refill when I saw this little guy, it definitely wins
for style points and if I need a small pen for travel or some other utilitarian
reason this would be my grab. The Style Fit at 0.5 has great flow which helps
balance out the very thin body which is hard to get a grip on with my larger
hands."

These are my new favorites. "
foxdenfarms7,"January 18, 2022","Giving it 5 stars because it is a very well made pen, love the vacuum filling
system, and it’s a beautiful pen. Dislike the size. Is bigger than I expected
and wish I had gotten the extra fine nib. For some reason this TWSBI and the ECO
TWSBI I purchased months ago have the same characteristics, which is to let the
ink flow like a river. It’s not the paper or ink, they are the only fountain
pens I have tried that do that. That’s why I wish that I had gotten an extra
fine nib because the fine writes just like one would expect a medium to write.
And you can’t buy a replacement nib for the iris that looks like an iris. It
is just plain steel "
WitchyMoon,"May 30, 2021","I love the VAC Iris! I got a F nib, and it writes with the smoothness that is a
well-known TWSBI quality! The line variation between the F and EF nib is not
very pronounced. However, if you are doing intricate drawing or writing Kanji, a
F vs EF nib might make a difference."
Ghoster013,"May 27, 2021","TWSBI excellence!  A beautiful pen with a fantastic nib.  Just enough feedback
for a great feeling writing experience.  This one will remain inked for a long
time to come.  "
foxdenfarms7,"August 26, 2022","This is my second review of this pen. Lowered one star, easily could have been
two. Was using it on my journal and wrote much longer then in then past. My hand
started to hurt to the point of quitting but another problem appeared and that
is ink flow control. If you completely tighten the cap it will soon stop
writing. Opening the cap only a little results in to much ink flow. In original
review I lamented the fact that the extra fine was the one to purchase, not the
fine that I did. So the more I think about how easy it would be for TWSBI to
offer the iris replacement nibs with the color treated nibs, and what a
disservice it is to their customers to offer the plain nibs the angrier it makes
me. I will not buy another whole pen to get an iris extra fine nib. Just bought
another 580ALR Prussian blue. Great pens. But. That is the last TWSBI pen I will
ever purchase. Just decided to change to 3 stars. "
kstone1031,"February 7, 2022","Love it! No regrets.It’s as pretty as everyone says and also reliable. Don’t
forget to twist the finial just a bit when writing to release the ink!"
tsesungwu,"January 5, 2022","Loving this so far. So smooth with a huge ink capacity- not sure I’ll always
remember how to fill it. I just need to remember it’s screw on. The heat
treated metal is very cool. "
flutefish,"September 4, 2019","Just got these and they are so much fun for creating doodles, checklists, etc.!
They make perfect round dots in a variety of sizes and with a little practice
make cute teardrop shapes as well. Love that the other end is a fine line for
writing, adding details to drawings, and more. I'll be getting more colors!"
tami,"May 7, 2020","I bought these on a whim and I can't imagine bullet/dot journaling without them.
They help keep my activity/habit trackers in order. One note, if you attempt to
write with the dot end, be sure your paper is on the thicker side. It bleeds
through on Leuchtturm1917 paper. Just using the dots in a activity/habit tracker
shows through but does not bleed through."
ada.inspired,"March 25, 2020","Wow dots! First I thought, well, I could draw circles with my mildliners, no
problem. But I got these anyways and I'm glad I did. They're fun and useful. I
use them to draw my attention to my to-dos and reminders in my meeting notes.
They also make data analysis work more colorful and joyful to look at! "
EllieOrigami,"December 11, 2021","Great colors & super fun to use. I love the dual tip... makes being creative
easier when it's all in one. "
Hello Kitty,"November 24, 2021","I love these markers. I had to get them because someone on YouTube uses them.
They really make your pages, “PoP”. "
notmanywords,"October 9, 2020","Great little set of unique markers! The fine tip end is great for ""normal""
writing and illustration, but the REAL exciting part of this set is the big
round dot tip! Very fun for varied line work in hand lettering, but the biggest
delight to dot, dot, dot a pattern or fill of little filled circles! Also very
nice for bullet journals as JetPens suggests in one of their videos.  "
kdellinger83,"September 14, 2020","I wish I had more color options but these are great for making lists. I've used
them for art pieces as well and getting a consistent dot size took some getting
used to but now I'm spoiled on perfect circles. "
xdannab,"August 20, 2020","I love this for Bullet Journaling. It makes my to do list pretty and
prioritized.Pros:- fun to use- pretty pastel colors- blends really well together to make more colors :OCons:- It can cause ink to smudge so use it first before writing on it if used as a
highlighter? or use ink after if you need it for that kind of purpose. Overall, I'm pretty happy I bought it, the fun factor is pretty impressive! And
of course it's functional for bullet journaling. It's not necessary, and if you
have markers already, then maybe don't get this. But if you need dots for a to
do list to help prioritize, this is pretty neat."
1tlbgo,"April 17, 2020","Very nice color and easy to work with.  I do usually have to press down a bit to
get the full range of the dot on the paper when I use the larger end.  But this
is really not much of a problem.   "
wmoses0106,"March 20, 2020","I LOVE THESE!!! I use them in trackers and to also add some interesting
backgrounds. Awesome tool to have for journaling! I wish they came in more
colors."
keyora.wheeler,"February 8, 2020","Both ends work super well, lovely dots Everytime!"
catie24,"January 7, 2020","I absolutely love these. The dotter end has great range of dot sizes, the bullet
end is a great thickness for titles and doodles. I was worried that bleeding was
going to be an issue, but there was little to none; so these are great for
planners.  The colors are great as well."
debraslong,"December 24, 2019","Love these. Fast way to Mark my habit tracker accurately and withought messing
around with stickers. Now I use these to highlight special dates on my monthly

Tara,"November 3, 2022",I enjoy the dots and this colorway is useful for color coding in my planner.
acadiemia,"September 30, 2022","I bought these when I randomly wanted a little something fun, I didn't really
have a plan to use them and as I was waiting for them to arrive I thought that
they would end up pretty useless because of the strange 'dot' aspect.However, on Hobonichi paper, these markers create a really beautiful watercolor
effect and I just can't get enough of them. It's almost like a very light
patina, even my wife has commented on how beautiful the ink dries. Writing
titles, drawings, borders, everything - these markers have ended up being my
absolute favorites and I don't even use them for the little dot designs they
advertise being for. So much more than just for making dots. "
shadykit,"September 5, 2022","I love these markers with my entire being, they're great for fun habit tracking!
The Kiwi is probably my favorite color of the bunch."
aspen,"August 29, 2022","The fine point writes perfect. I love the colors -- I generally love pink, but
the Kiwi was a clear winner for me -- it's a perfect, almost pastel lime green.
The dots come out wonderful and the colors aren't dark or overwhelming at all.
Compared to the midliners, they're slightly more vibrant, but that's great for
making dots. "
uiogd.pax,"August 25, 2022",Very cool for habit tracking
jinksb,"July 26, 2022","I wanted to try these out in my bullet journal. The dot tip is a great idea. I
just need a little practice to get the dot size I want. Half star off for the
4-color set being so - -pastel, the other half star off for being pricey "
yuce,"June 9, 2022","The dot marker is really versatile, the ink has ghosting on Tomoe River Paper
(hobonichi weeks) but no bleeding through. Kinda obvious but don't use these or
any water based marker with water based fountain pen ink- I've written with
fountain pen ink over the marker with some degree of success (lots of feathering
but legible.)"
Saltykelp,"April 3, 2022","Love the dot side. Makes writing with the dot side round and cute  I wish the pen could be short though. It’s slightly too long compared to all
my other pens. "
spinney,"April 2, 2022","I love the dot end. But note when Jetpens says the other end has a ""hard plastic
nib,"" they aren't teasing! It's too firm for my taste. Also, the colors in this
set are very pale, so that nib end isn't super useful, anyway. "
kathleen.raddatz,"March 25, 2022",These are great pens and the dot end is quite versatile. Id love more colors! 
spinney,"January 28, 2022","These are lovely. I purchased them to use the ""dot"" end for to-do style bujo

tomalab,"November 27, 2021","These are nice pens. I ended up getting a few more of them. The dot side is fun

more colors and one of the metallic ones too."
artistamono36,"November 13, 2021",Good starter colors. They are perfect for bullet point in a planner or journal.
kelliblakejenkins,"October 26, 2021","I'm so happy I found these! I love using the fine tip for sketching or making

mark ,"August 9, 2021",awesome! such beautiful colors
friedunicorn1,"July 6, 2021","I love these! They are very versatile markers, and this set comes with a great
selection of colors to start out with. The dots make decorative note-taking easy
to achieve, and the thin pen side is surprisingly very sturdy and great to write
with. I was expecting a more flexible tip (like a felt pen), but these hold up
well and I can't wait to take more notes with them."
tlsanders80,"June 2, 2021",PERFECT for chart keeping in my Jibun techo!
Jane,"June 2, 2021","I was looking for highlighters/markers that specifically could creat dots on
paper, so i was super estatic when I saw these avaliable on JetPens! I've been

there is another side, (thin tipped) I sheldom use it but it seems to be okay as
well."

spiffdeb,"January 5, 2021","Love the idea of them, but when using the dot side it leaves a glob of ink that
looks uneven. Can blot it, but not worth it for me. "
stella,"December 28, 2020","These are perfect for grading papers--I can dot the roster for students who have
not yet submitted work (different colors for different assignments). I also use
them to keep track of cold-calling in class. Good stuff. "
bhuvanaa,"December 21, 2020","Love this. The colors are vibrant and they don't bleed into the page. I am using
good quality paper meant for fountain pens so I don't know how they do on

realrabbit,"January 17, 2020","super cute!!! i like to think of these as a weird blend of a marker,

time."
Maren,"October 25, 2019",These are really fun for doodling. 
candrusiak,"December 28, 2011","I've carried this pen in my pocket on a daily basis for the last 8 years. That's
all you need to know. "
dc11,"December 17, 2012","The pen fits nicely in my pocket, but I've never had one of these pens that
didn't end up globs around the point. I gave up on these after purchasing about
five different refills and getting the same result."
capukat,"April 11, 2015","Smooth finish, nice weight, and best of all it is virtually indestructible.Usually I would prefer my writing instruments a little longer but the center of
gravity in this pen makes for quite the comfortable grip.I've had fun playing around with pressurized pens. This one works great to
consistently deliver a nice smooth flow of ink despite the writing surface. I
have yet to go fully underwater with this but writing on soaked pieces of paper
has been fun to try. If only I could test it outer space too :)"
Healthclarity,"April 10, 2016","I've had two of these. I love everything about it except the way it writes, It's
not horrible but it's not as smooth and flawless as I like. It is great for
carrying every where. Almost like having a pocket knife. I wouldn't use it
everyday, it just doesn't write as smooth as other pens. I'm going to try one of
the pocket fountain pens. I love fountain pens. I give it 3 stars for size and
construction, but not five because of it's writing quality."
Sasegelhorst,"February 25, 2012","What a nice pen! Very artistic and nicely balanced when the cap is
posted...smaller than i thought though so perfect for shirt pockets!"
walfus,"November 9, 2018","It's OK. Small, well-built, but writes like a cheap ballpoint. Albeit a cheap
ballpoint that works upside down."
Lefties r cool,"January 1, 2021","I bring my little black fisher bullet pen on every fishing and hiking trip I go
on! (Its amazing how much you need a pen in the middle of nowhere!) Its really
small capped, so it fits well in jean pockets, and when the cap is mounted, Its
the size of a regular pen! Also, when they say they can work no matter what,
they aren't kidding! I've jotted things down in 20° below freezing (F) and it
worked great! And left it in a truck in direct sun for 3 hours, and it still
writes better than any other pen I've seen."
stephaniemaypalmer,"April 13, 2019","I enjoy the weight and feel of this pen in hand, but definitely not the way it
writes. I've tried two different ink weights (fine and medium) for it and they
aren't as smooth as I'd like. The medium ink globs up a bunch too. A little
disappointing, but still a somewhat decent pen to toss in a bag and have around."
Church424,"July 31, 2020","It’s a really nice and very pocket space friendly pen. The nib as a very
slight bit of wobble to it which is a bit annoying, but other wise is great."
alanine,"March 23, 2020","This pen lives in my pocket next to my standard-sized wallet. Capped, it's about
the same length as the wallet, so it's a perfect fit. I love having a pen on
hand all the time that will write on anything, under any conditions, in any
position. The satin finish feels and looks great, and has yet to accumulate any
visible wear after years of pocket duty.My only complaints are that the cartridge starts spitting globs of ink onto the
page long before it's used up, and the satin finish is so smooth that the pen
will slide out of the pockets of many dress pants a bit too easily. That said,
the cartridges do last quite awhile - usually a few years with my intermittent
use - before the globs start."
pententious,"November 2, 2016",Perfect EDC Pen. Compact and easy to carry around.
Thebarne,"October 4, 2015","This is the second fisher space pen bullet I've owned.  I lost my first one and
immediately had to buy a new one.  This time I bought it with the fine refill
but I still love the medium point and would recommend it using it.  I call this
pen my sketching pen but I also use it for jotting down notes.  I use this pen
for sketching because you can get so much variety just with changing the
pressure. But if you do rub too hard with your hand the pen can smudge a bit. 
The matte body might take awhile to get used but it does make it look classy.  "
Amdovsen,"April 7, 2015",I ordered this because i lost the one I had. Great pen!
pingapong64,"December 6, 2022","Great pen... While I had it. I wound up losing the pen. It's too small to just
keep in my pocket and forget about. Would recommend a larger pen with the same
fisher cartridge."
JVande,"December 21, 2021","Add the clip so it won't roll off the table... press the clip as far along the
pen cover as you are comfortable. People that complain about the clip falling
off but on my two MATTE FINISH bullet pens there's a full 3/8"" from the top of
the clip to top of the pen. NOTE: I had to press pretty hard to get it there but
I've never had a clip slip off of the matte finish bullet pens."
michaelandrewandrade,"July 26, 2021","Great all around beater pen. Writes anywhere every time and feels quality. My
only gripe is that it’s very small unposted, but small size is kind of the
point of the Bullet design. Comparable to a standard size pen posted.   "
markwhiting,"June 8, 2021","Overall I like this pen but I wish it was better made and had better ink flow.
The manufacturing is not bad, but the design means that it makes some noise if
you shake it, and the way the lid goes on the back while in use is not very to
bust. The ink flow is not terrible, but lacks the flow we might expect from the
best pens today."
genniper,"December 2, 2020","Purchased as a gift.  Very nice quality, although easy to misplace."

webstriker,"January 28, 2019","Just drop it in your pocket and when you are ready uncap, post and jot. One of
my favorite EDC. I had two but one is missing. Small enough  to carry in the
fold of your wallet."
ADR in NY,"January 14, 2019","This pen is a delightful surprise! I was in search of a small jotter pen to take
the place of my Parker Jotter which I never loved but was convenient to have
during my travels. Its weight is satisfactory. Its compact size pairs nicely
with the passport-sized Traveler's Notebook or any small memo writing pad. When
the cap is posted, it becomes an average sized pen which is terrific. The Fisher
Space ink cartridge is decent and writes well. I purchased two items which
upgraded this pen for me: (1) the Fisher Space Bullet pen clip in gold (only
because I like the black/gold color combination) and (2) the Zebra JK gel refill
(some of the refill's plastic end needs to be clipped off to get it to a perfect
length). I plan to purchase a couple more. I recommend this item."
LoJo,"December 3, 2018","Love these bullet pens.  It is true, as a ballpoint pen they're just meh.  BUT,
the real value is in an EDC pen that will write on anything - not just paper for
grocery lists.  When working on projects I've marked on wood, plastic, pvc, even
a porcelain mug.  Haven't needed it underwater yet but I hear it'll do that too."
elrot54,"October 4, 2018","Beautiful pen. Small, light, and extremely comfortable to hold and use. The only
drawback is the refill. Though fisher space pen refills are commendable in their
resourcefulness and the ability to use them anywhere, they aren't exactly a joy
to write with. If you can find a better refill, however, this may be one of the
best pens you can use."
jaxd,"September 19, 2018","I love this pen! the way the ink flows gives it a great texture that i love to
see in my doodles, but it is important to know that the ink does kinda blob up
sometimes, and you should wait for the ink to dry a bit before you rub over it.
its a convenient size for inside pockets in jackets and the case is so cute. I
just ordered some refill ink so I just wanted to gush about it lol "
alfredolagos,"September 1, 2018","So far - I am very happy with the Space Pen.  It is discrete, easy to write

dducky,"July 29, 2018","Great pen for everyday carry.  Don't notice it in your pocket until you need it.
 Writes better than most ballpoints and is big enough to write comfortably when
posted.  Comes in a cool little plastic box with a lunar surface insert; really
makes it look like an alien artifact.  Very nice pen overall."

Ally,"March 17, 2016","Perfect for everyday carry. I have to say it is a little bit harder to put the

will fall off. Otherwise typical Fisher Space Pen quality!"

way in my pocket.Shipping was fast. Thanks."
Separisa,"October 20, 2015","I'm the first-tryer of the space pen, it's absolutely adorable and funny to
experiment with)) It's small - turns into regular pen size after placing cap to
a pen end. Pleasantly heavy also. Clip was no useful so I removed it at the same
day (ordered separately!). Black medium is really a little white spots at trase
leaving, but it's okay for me =) "

Shamalama Dingdong,"February 4, 2015","This is my daily carry pen, the one I always have in my pocket. I've carried one
for many years and somehow managed not to lose it. The original (medium black)
cartridge wasn't the best, certainly not as smooth as a Jetstream, and suffered
from intermittent globbing, but after replacing it with a fine blue cartridge I
was much happier with the result.All in all, a decent ballpoint pen that will survive back pocket carry for
years, being dropped on the floor, and all kinds of abuse, and will keep on
writing."
M123,"August 18, 2012","convenient to have in your pocket. and goes great with Rite In The Rain Paper. medium point can be a little iffy when writing, as in taking notes. overall it's
great, ink lasts forever. refills aren't too expensive either. own two of these in medium and a large
clicker style in fine point. i still like the fine point better. "

fehrkj,"January 20, 2013","Space pens are indeed a great gift.  My only complaint is that they just don't
write as well as most of the pens on Jetpens.  They don't write poorly, but the
ink, pressure, and consistency is nowhere near as good as others.  I think that
everyone should have a Space Pen so that they can say that they ""Have a Space
Pen"".  It's a novelty, it looks nice and has great balance.  You're everyday
writing tool?....i hope not. "
electricabyss,"July 9, 2015","What an amazing pen!  The body is made of a smooth metal, but not too slick that
it slides out of your hand.  The weight is wonderful and the ever so slightly
wider pen body fits comfortably in my hand, and keeps my hand from cramping
after lots of writing.  The nib, while labeled Fine, is a Japanese Fine so it is
incredibly precise and thin, and is an absolute pleasure to write with.  Using
the Iroshizuku ink in this makes the pen just absolutely delicious to write
with.  My only complaint is some of the more colorful bodies have a
cheap-looking animal print ring around them, which is just kind of ugly (why I
eventually went with the all-silver one).Honestly, I never knew I liked fountain pens before I used this pen (I stayed
with my Hi-Tec-C's), but this has been such a wonderful investment!  I couldn't
be happier! I will say don't store your pen upside-down or sideways in a pen case as you're
just asking for ink to leak, but it has so far only had a little bit of ink show
up on the nib, amazingly!  Anyone who wants to try a fountain pen should
DEFINITELY buy one (or all, for all of the Iroshizuku colors!) of the Pilot
Metropolitans."
mbright,"August 31, 2016","Excellent pen overall and a great value. Depending on what I have inked up this

are as good a value as this pen.Pros:Excellent priceSmooth, firm nibSturdy brass bodyComes packaged with a converter (though I prefer the Con-50)Pleasant understated designPleasingly heavy (I prefer to write without the cap posted, though it does post
securely if you prefer)Nib can be swapped with Pilot Penmanship or Plumix if you want an extra fine or
stub nib in this body. Just pull the nib and the feed straight out.Cons:I would prefer a screw capSection is a bit slippery"
xalemanix94,"July 16, 2016","This pen changed my life.You may think that is an understatement, but allow me to explain. I grew up on
computers, typed every paper I had the opportunity to, and by the time I
graduated, I had gotten my handwriting up to the standard of having a legible
name at the top of tests. Writing, for me, was uncomfortable, unpleasant, and
boring; and my feelings were reflected in my handwriting. Then, my best friend
showed me her pilot metro and had me write a few scribbles in her notebook, and
my opinion changed. I bought my own metro not long after, and my handwriting has
improved astoundingly.Thank you, LT, for saving my penmanship."
Kyle,"October 4, 2016","Such a great pen for the price!Pros: Feels solid and weighty. Looks great. Cheap!Cons: Being a Japanese pen, the Fine nib is quite fine; closer to what I would
expect out of an extra fine."

anthonyzampieri,"November 28, 2018","Love the pen, it speaks for itself. Feels good in he hand and writes strong and
confident, this was my first real fountain pen, very impressed though. "
rommel,"August 6, 2018","I don't usually write reviews but belt compelled to do so for this pen. 
Surprisingly heavy given it's price point.  Wonderfully smooth fine-point nib
with no skipping.  Nib is quite stiff but that's what I like.  Loaded with
Noodler's Antietam, the script looks like it was written in venous blood.  From
an avowed Waterman Carene snob, well done Pilot!  "
thejasonjsmith,"July 21, 2018","This is my favorite fountain pen.  It's the best I have ever used for writing. I
am 50 and have been using fountain pens for note taking in school, writing at
home and work since I was 15 years old.  THIS one, is my favorite.Note: I may be a bit of an anomaly, I'm ambidextrous but I write with my left
hand -- and many fountain pens are just not so good for lefties.  This one is
smooth enough that it doesn't matter which hand I use with it.It's a joy overtime I have a need to write and pick this one up.  A friend told
me how much she loves this pen when she borrowed it so I gifted it to her and am
now buying another to replace it.I highly recommend this pen to anyone who enjoys writing or drawing but
especially to those who like fountain pens, you won't regret this one."
AlRod,"November 15, 2016","This is one of the best pens I own! I loved it so much I ordered a second one.
The fine nib was perfect for writing on crappy copy paper at work. I refill the
cartridges using a syringe and they hold a pretty decent volume of ink. It can
take a lot of hard work!"
cliffordcrise,"January 27, 2016","All of the other reviews I read about this pen were what actually convinced me
to buy it.  I have not been disappointed in that choice.  This pen writes like a
dream straight out of the box.  I am currently using the Diamine Shimmering Seas
ink in this and the fine nib.  I have several other pens that are on both ends
of the price spectrum and this one writes as well as any two hundred dollar pen
out there.  I use this as my daily writer and it gets used for writing work
orders, draft estimates and the myriad of other daily writing chores of a
contractor.  There was no scratchiness or other irritating quirks to the pen
that I can really tell, it just writes smooth and fluid."
ginger,"January 10, 2016","Am I the only person who doesn't love this pen? It's a really fine point, much
finer than my Preppy or TWSBI fines, and a very dry writer. It's not scratchy,
but it has a lot of feedback due to being so fine. But the real deal-breaker,
for me, is the ridge where the cap snaps on. It's right where my fingers go, and
it's very uncomfortable. I can handle a bit of a ridge or threads like on most
pens, but this thing has a ledge there. I gave the pen to my husband and he
loves it. Go figure. Now he's after my ink, but that's a different story...."
Naoca,"November 15, 2022","well this was a total waste of money...I originally gave it 4 stars because my
only complain was that it holds too little ink. But only after having it for
less than 2 days my tip is already chipped. I never dropped it, I had only use
it twice to write notes. And the fact that Pilot does not let you buy
replacement nib separately is frustrating, why do I have to buy another pen just
to get another nip? I don't know why this pen is so highly rated, a plastic
platinum preppy is more durable than this thing"
Naoca,"November 14, 2022","Beautiful pen, but the squeeze converter it comes in holds so little ink…not
really convenient if you have to write a lot"
tencloudfall,"September 11, 2022","This pen is awesome to look at -- super gorgeous and well constructed. It writes
smoothly for me with an appropriately wet flowing ink, and I have no worries
about taking it around with me as an everyday pen. Ergonomically it's not ideal
for me personally for several different reasons: because it's made of sturdy
brass, it's a bit heavy for my small hand even when unposted, the grip is quite
narrow which leads to hand cramps for me, and the step down is painful for me. I
love this pen and its sturdy design, but I can only use it for short notes
rather than long writing sessions. I ended up switching to the lighter, wider,
stepless Pilot Prera for my longer writing sessions, and keep this one for
accents and headings. I think some people will find the Pilot Metro works well
for their hands, especially if you like a weighty pen with a narrow grip, but
not for everyone."
meadowlark,"August 15, 2022","This is a smooth writing pen that is used daily in my homeschool. My children

not had any problems with Metro pens."
Natalia,"June 23, 2022","Got this pen back in 2015 and I still love it. Very simple design, comfortable
to hold for long periods of time. This was my daily journaling pen for years. I
prefer to write posted because I like the extra weight while I write.Never had an issue with the ink, I keep this one as my always black ink pen. Use
the pilot namiki black cartridges and the ink always comes out right away even
after not being used in a long time.Would recommend!"

Mason,"November 11, 2021","There is something off about this pen.I tried it, and I wanted to like it. But I don't. The balance feels off when I
try to post  the cap. Also I think the line may be too narrow. There is
something off about the grip section, my finger wants to sit in the groove that
catches the pen cap when closing. The pen is also to short for my hand I think.So, why am I still giving it a 5 star review? The pen has no defects from a
production standpoint. It is well constructed, and has good value. Just because
it doesn't work for me, doesn't mean it wont work for you. :) [post: put pen cap on the back]"
temporalstew,"October 30, 2021","More than half a year later and 9 fountain pens in, this remains one of my
favorites and without question the one I have used most. Others are more
comfortable for me--I find that my (somewhat large) hands struggle with the
thinnest point of the grip and that the point where it jumps up to the body of
the pen, designed at virtually a 90 degree angle so that the cap is flush with
the body, isn't necessarily noticeably uncomfortable but does eventually make my
hand cramp up a bit faster than the pens I have since purchased for writing
(most of them I use to draw).What saves it for me? The construction of the pen is so solid, especially at the
20 dollar price point. I find the silver finish to be soft and calming,
visually. The pen is slick and gorgeous. The nib is just about as perfect as I
know steel nibs to get, at least thus far--strikes a perfect balance between
being juicy enough to feel buttery smooth if I'm not pressing down while I write
while being just dry enough to be usable (with the standard Noodler's Black Ink)
on paper not specifically designed for fountain pens, something some much
scratchier pens I own still fail at. This thing is a dream--only fault is that,
for some, it may not be the most suitable for long writing sessions. I have
certainly survived doing so though--for a time, this was the only pen I was
willing to write with."
alanalvarado585,"September 23, 2021","This pen is fantastic. I have only tried pilot penmanship and lamy safari before
and this one is my favorite out of the three. It provides for much finer writing
than the safari does (also fine nib) and it does so without sacrificing any
smoothness in my experience. It comes with a nice rubber converter and an ink
cartridge which lasted me a bit longer than the converter. The weight is also
not too heavy but it just makes it feel more like an expensive pen."

noahschaffer,"March 28, 2021","Solid pens. I really like these. Took me a little while to find that I like a
fine nib for regular lined paper. I use a shim to spread the tines a little,
because I like a wet flow. But I imagine that the flow isn't bad without doing
that.I love that these are a nice heavy brass. I want some weight in my pen. The snap
cap makes them easy to take intermittent quick notes, because it's faster to
deploy than a screw-on cap. Oh, and the nib/feed is super easy to disassemble
and clean, unlike other pens where the nib/feed is one unit and can't be
disassembled. I keep looking for an excuse to spend more money on a pen, but
these seem to fit my needs better than most other pens I'm considering. Great
pens."

madrid,"October 17, 2019","I wanted this so I could load it with Diamine ""Silver Fox"" ink. It's perfect for
that.For the most part, Pilot Metropolitans deserve their high reputation. Their nibs
are ultra reliable—that's the main thing.Two drawbacks that don't always get mentioned. The converters are famously
displeasing. There's always a substantial air bubble you can't get rid of.
(Maybe there's some trick... but I didn't get that memo.) The other thing is the caps snap *really* hard. Consequently, microdroplets of
ink get flung off the nib every time you cap the pen. Doesn't matter at first,
but comes a point when you have a cap-full of ink waiting to show up on the
backside of the pen when you post. Next stop: your hand.Those two problems are not very tragic. Certainly haven't stopped me from buying
the things. I have five of ’em. "

ADR in NY,"March 13, 2018","I didn't think I would like a fine nib but wanted to give it a try nonetheless.
I read reviews saying that fine nibs produced too narrow of a lines and were
scratchy. I must say that the nib found on this pen produces a line to my
liking. While it isn't as smooth as the medium nib, its not bad enough to deem
it useless or inadequate. I'm someone who believed she could never use anything
but a medium. Turns out I've changed my mind and the fine nib found on this
Metropolitan pen helped get me there. I love metal-bodied pens and have small
hands. I find this pen's diameter, weight, and length (posted and capped) quite
nice, not too heavy, not too light. Great product Pilot!"
vestiline,"February 7, 2018","Overall, I do love this pen. It writes smooth, it solves the hand cramps I have
that I sometimes get due to writing alot. The only problem I had, and it just might be due to my pen in particular, is
that the squeeze converter didn't fit as snugly as the cartage and wound up
coming out in the pen body itself and got ink everywhere. "

the TWSBI are plastic. That being said, it's not heavy by any means.The inclusion of a squeeze converter is great too, though I think I will be
getting a twist one. If I broke this pen, I would certainly buy another in a
heartbeat.One thing to note: the location where the cap clicks onto the pen is somewhat
sharp and uncomfortable if you grip very tightly on the lower part of the grip.

Just a heads up though: don't use it on the lined paper you'd buy in those

paper, and is about twice as thick. Invest in some good quality paper—you
won't be disappointed! :D"
tseltz,"April 21, 2016","This was the second fountain pen I ever purchased.  My first pen had a medium
nib which required much larger lettering than I traditionally use.  The fine nib
works great.  Initially I used J. Herbin Perle Noire ink , but have noticed a
slight improvement after switching to Pilot iroshizuku ink.  The metal body has
a weight which I would describe a comfortable but may be on the heavy side for
some users.  It does not have a fragile plastic feel.  Overall, a wonderful pen.
 I am considering purchasing a second in order to have simultaneous nib options.

mac.waskiewicz,"September 4, 2015","A very nice pen. It looks very good, feels good in the hand. The fine nib gives
me the fine line which I prefer when writing, since I tend to write small. The
only fault is keeping the cap posted when writing. I have a large hand and
sometimes push the cap off if it is not very firmly seated while writing. That
will cure itself over time as habit starts to kick in and firm posting becomes
the norm. Definitely my favorite pen in my limited stable of pens."

A.LEIGH.RUBIN,"January 8, 2021","This is my third vanishing point and second Decimo.  At first I was
exceptionally resistant to the idea of a retractable fountain pen.  It seemed
almost... vulgar.  As if the retraction could make the feeling of writing with a
fountain pen less enjoyable and more mundane.  But boy, could that not be
further from the truth.  Not only is the writing delivery of this pen smooth and
exquisite, but the retractable nature of it is so satisfying and fells
mechanically solid.  It's probably bad for the pen, but I find myself clicking
it over the course of the day just to experience the satisfaction of seeing that
beautiful 18k white gold nib retract and appear like magic.  It's wonderful and
magical.  If I had one criticism, it would only be the lack of available colors
for the Decimo.  There is more variety and limited edition releases with the
normal wide barrel, and I eagerly await the day when Pilot releases a similar
variety for the Decimo line.  Hands down my favorite pen ever and if anyone
asked me what I wanted for my birthday or for Christmas, I'd simply say ""Another
Decimo, Please!!"""
i8thepie,"July 9, 2020","I don't use this pen for extended writing sessions because of the goofy clip
placement, but honestly I use this pen mostly for quick notes. It's perfect for
pocket carry: when I need to jot something down, I pull this bad boy out, click,
then bada bing bada boom I've got it written down. The nib is a pleasure, and
glides (with control!) across the paper like a veteran ballerina."
rennysoncemann,"May 27, 2019","I already have a standard Vanishing Point (not a Decimo), which my wife likes
but says she wouldn't one one herself because it's too heavy.  So the Decimo
seemed perfect for her - same writing characteristics in a lighter, slimmer pen.
 I gave her one for Mother's day and she loves it.  Highly recommended, very
smooth writer, no cap to fuss with."
sgrayson,"February 6, 2018","The pen was excellent, the service fast, and the price very good for this pen."

soslyvi,"October 9, 2020",This pen is truly amazing!!!  Such a joy to write with!!!
katie.dowdle,"November 14, 2012","I got this pen because it is retractable. However, due to the price point I'm
hesitant to take it to work (where I need the convenience of a retractable pen).
The pink Capless Decimo writes smoothly, but I think the Pilot Cavalier may have
a finer line. The clip near the grip is not in my way. The shape of the pen and
the shiny finish makes my fingers slip (even with very dry hands). The Capless
Decimo is a good pen, but I prefer to use the Cavalier. "
marie9999,"July 19, 2012","Oh my! This is such a nice pen - I own one Pilot Vanishing Point but never
really use it because the grip is slightly larger than I like.  This pen uses
the exact same nib insert as the Vanishing Point but is better balanced.  Love
It!!!  If Pilot would introduce this size in the States I honestly believe it
would sell as well as the Vanishing Point but thank goodness JetPens is here to
take care of that void!"
bwatarai,"June 7, 2011","This writes about as fine as the pilot penmenship, but is a thousand times
smoother. And you can't beat the convenience of the retractable nib. It is a bit
pricey, but you do indeed get what you pay for. And by that I mean you get A LOT"
mccomas,"February 12, 2018","This is the best pen I have ever used! It brings the best of a fountain pen with

martcara77,"January 10, 2017","I am in love with this fine writing instrument.  Admittedly my love and
addiction to PILOT pens runs deep.   On the fancy end this is my go to.  It is
beautiful on the outside.  It writes beautifully.  I have not found any paper it
has not been able to write smoothly on.  It cause other to ask me ""what is
that"".  This helps to bring back fountain pens because it is not intimidating
and draws novice in to see what I am using.  It is not your traditional fountain
pen.  It is also sturdy.  I have take this pen with me everywhere.  I have been
a bit rough.  It holds its on.  It still looks as elegant and clean as the day I
purchased it.  This is an excellent pen to give a graduate, executive or even a
teacher like myself.  "
chelsea,"August 14, 2018","I spent weeks just looking at photos of this pen before finally buying it.
It’s such a beautiful pen and an amazing writer. I was afraid that the clip
placement would bother me (I hold pens very weirdly) but it was perfect!
Currently have it filled up with Sailor Chushu and it writes so smoothly."
noraishibashi,"July 3, 2017","I love the Pilot vanishing point fountain pens.I have owned them for many years
and give them as gifts. They are unusual and very functional."
Jimmysquarefoot101,"March 18, 2017","I know that this is supposed​ to be a little more comfortable than the pilot
vanishing point being thinner in the barrel, but for some reason with this I had
a little getting used to.  But it writes just as well as the vanishing point. 
Of course you can switch out the nibs so it's quite versitle with the pilot
vanishing point if you have other nib units to swap with.  "
so.gayat,"January 11, 2023","Wonderful. The smoothest writing experience. The gold nib really seems to make a
difference. The barrel is a bit smaller than the normal Capless, which is great
for my small hands. The grip can be odd to figure out, depending on how you are
used to holding your pen, but I have no regrets."
amaepudding,"November 27, 2020","This pen is stunning. JetPens got it to me quickly and safely; it arrived
packaged with a lot of care. The F nib writes a thin yet wet line (expected from
a gold nib) and it is incredibly comfortable to write with. It's noticeably
lighter than my standard Pilot VP, though that isn't a bad thing. I wish the
clip was more arched like the VP, but the decimo clip is still sturdy and works
well. I love this pen!"

maxwashl,"October 19, 2016","I'm really pleased with this as my first click fountain pen. The nib is rather
flexible and it's perfect for everyday carry to me."
suesmerchants,"May 14, 2016","I love the pen but the Fine nib is more like Medium. I have a Vanishing Point
bought several years ago. That Fine nib produces a markedly thinner line than
this new one. I read that nib sections should be transferable between pens, but
the old nib section is just too wide to work properly in the new, slimmer
designed pen. Do you have the Extra Fine nibs?"
lfbost,"December 28, 2022","Very nice multi-pen. However pencil lead section jammed soon after using first

Pinataplans,"January 11, 2021","If you're like me and trying to choose between the two neutral color options of
these dot markers (Platinum and Fawn), go with the Platinum. I have both colors,
and vastly prefer the Platinum because it's clean and has more visual impact.
(The Fawn sometimes looks like a tea or coffee stain - but hey, that might be
your aesthetic.) Also the Platinum fineliner is far more readable than the Fawn,
which is so light it's useless to write with."
olivialiu940,"August 10, 2022","Love this! The dotter side is very cool and fun to use. You can get different
thicknesses from it while the fineliner tip is sturdy and won't deform after
multiple uses."

lines for smaller fonts!"

ink that it bleeds through even my thickest paper which resists everything short
of permanent markers."
Rotsterne,"March 7, 2022","This dot marker works very well for my purposes (marking habit trackers). It
looks like it deposits a lot of ink (it comes out dark) when you press a little
more firmly, but it dries back to a reasonably light gray fairly quickly. If I
start getting more into habit tracking, I think I will want a set of these for
color coding . I don't regret this purchase, and will likely order it again when

precise as the original large bullet point, but I didn't mind. The color laydown
is much more juicy(???) And the wide area coverage makes filling things in
pretty easy. Also, of course, it makes a wide variety of uniform dot sizes as
well. The fine tip is very thin at first, but it gets a little wider and more
visible after a couple uses. The platinum color gives the appearence of writing
with a pencil, which is nice. Very soft appearence overall. The cap stacking
system definitely took a little getting used to but other than that, a solid
pen, very versatile and one of my go-to tools. "

with this since reviews showed this to be cheap and good. Having used the pen
for a few days now, I can totally vouch for that. The pen glides over paper and
I like the blue-black ink. For the price, this is a no-brainer purchase. "
Carolee,"June 29, 2018","What a great deal for an excellent pen. I think it's more navy than
blue-black--great shade either way. It doesn't feel cheap in the hand. A nice
pen."
norajean,"March 10, 2019","Really love this pen.  It writes beautifully, everytime, and is very smooth for
a fine nib. It has become my 'go to' pen.  I would like to purchase some other
colors, or maybe the bundle which I believe comes filled with ink to match the
pen, how cool is that?  Platinum has just had their 100th Anniversary, so they
must be doing something right.  For such a frugally priced pen, it is
impressive."
radiotvstar,"January 9, 2019","Possibly the best pen in existence for this price. The pen is better than pens

Dalmindor,"September 25, 2021","This pen writes very nicely and I adore the color and shading of the blue-black
ink, but the pen body is very fragile. Mine cracked around the threads within a
week or two of use. The pen is still usable, thankfully! I just can’t uncap it
without first removing the outer body and gripping the inner mechanisms of the
pen. If you want this pen to last, just be very careful not to over-tighten it when
screwing it back together, and be careful not to drop it or subject it to any
sort of pressure."

was scratchy with the blue-black ink as well.I partially refilled the pen with water and some noodler's ink so at least it
writes ok now. But I wouldn't recommend the fine tip preppy. The medium tip
platinum preppy had a better ink flow and smoother writing."

Francesca,"February 1, 2021","I bought the Preppy Blue-Black 03 to see how it fared against the Pilot Petit 1
with a Fine nib. The Petit is shorter than the Preppy, posts with a satisfying
click, has a thicker grip section and a smooth nib, and comes with a true
blue-black ink cartridge; its cap doesn’t seal well, though. The Preppy is
longer than the Petit, posts well but can easily be used unposted, has a thinner
grip section than the Pilot and a nib with slight feedback—though
cushioned—, and comes with a blue-black ink cartridge that is actually blue to
my eye; its cap seals well thanks to the “Slip and Seal” inner cap. I prefer
the Preppy: it’s more comfortable to use, its nib feels cushioned and the ink
doesn’t dry on the nib, or evaporate in the cartridge or feather like the
Pilot. The Preppy wins the battle!"
tylermumford,"August 26, 2020","I like how this pen writes, but it's been failing to start about half of the
time when I pick it up. I've tried storing it tip down and tip up, and I've
cleaned it as best I can. This is one of my first two fountain pens; I'm brand
new to this. I wish it were better, but it's just not always ready. If I pick it
up and it doesn't write immediately, I can shake it for about six seconds to get
it to write. When it does write, I really like it. It's smooth and puts down a nice line. I
like the included blue ink, and it feels good in my hand posted or unposted. But
there's already a crack in the plastic just above the grip section, and the
intermittent starting is frustrating. I also don't love how much branding and imagery there is on the pen. The barcode
seems especially unnecessary to me. The Platinum Prefounte seems more classy
than this, but I can't deny the Preppy's value and low cost. I may buy another Preppy to get a fun color and see if I have a one-off bad pen.
I want to like it. I don't regret buying it; it's just been frustrating."

jesusbuenrostro92,"March 6, 2020","This pen really dissapointed me honestly. I bought it because I'd always heard
it was for its price a really solid pen. But it has a lot of false starts and

fountain pen a try after using this. "

holds gorgeous blue black ink that flows easily onto any quality of paper, and
sports the coveted ability to be refilled with any ink using a converter, all
wrapped into a pretty crystal blue body. I fully intend to buy three more
expensive Platinum fountain pens just because of how much I loved the nib on
this pen. I could write an ode to it. In fact, I might just write an ode to the
Platinum Preppy using my Platinum Preppy. Please buy this for yourself. Everyone

blasphemy. I just like the way it lays ink on paper. I refill it with the
syringe thing. I have several and they require little maintenance and the ink
doesn't dry out if not used for a while. It looks like something a child would
use (probably parents buy them for their kids as a ""starter"" pen) but if you
don't need to impress anyone but yourself and your notebook, I recommend these."

fountain pens with this low-risk pen."
stokerblake1,"March 7, 2022","Decent cheap fountain pen. Writes smoothly but I haven't figured out how to
fully disassemble it for cleaning yet. Changing out inks seems like a bit of a
challenge with these pens, but I have yet to try. The plastic feels like
plastic, its a cheap pen, you kinda get what you pay for. They seem like durable
plastic, and very good quality for the price. However, I do not recommend using
the stock ink, it is a very watery gray-blue that does not look good. It also
seeped out of the feed and filled that chamber, which did not happen when I used
other inks in the pen. The cap does seal very well, I have not had any issues
with the pens drying out."

is a lovely color. I wasn't 100% certain on what nib to get, but it turns out
the fine works for me as I've been using a Midori MD notebook and I can write in
the grids. Even though the Preppy is fairly inexpensive, I plan to use it for a

louisesumner,"March 27, 2019","I got this pen in the blue-black sampler and it was my favorite of the bunch. I
love how it's a fine nib, but the ink still flows very smoothly. I will say that
its ink is lighter in color than some of the other blue-black options in the
sampler, but I love the color!"
PepperBlossom,"March 23, 2019","The included cartridge was a bust for me, but with Blackstone in the converter,
I actually love this pen. Before this (my first fountain pen), I was unaware of
how frequently my pen is rotated while I draw, so that took some getting used
to. Finding the sweet spot and being more mindful of the pen and grip has added
an element to my drawing experience that I sort of like. Ymmv"

rachel.strickman,"July 18, 2022","Having a wonderful time trying out all the colours. I use them to add accents
and colours to my hobonichi techo. I don't use them for highlighting on printer
paper, because of the show-through which I can't stand, but I have no trouble
with the tomoe river paper or with Kokuyo Campus paper. Much has been said about
the wonders of mildliners, but I'll add that I really like the balance of a
quite wet ink with a quite stiff brush, which allows you to get some interesting
layering and shadowing effects, and I love that they are shorter than Tombow
brush pens-- because they fit in a pencil case! Thank you Jetpens for putting
together this sampler pack. "

foxinthestars,"March 23, 2011","Obviously these fit some people's writing style, but for me, they're too broad
and wet---so wet that I have trouble with feathering and bleed-through on some
papers where drier pens work fine. As one other minor nit, the inkview window is
almost useless; there's only a window on one side, and with no way for light to
come through, you can hardly see anything (not that I would mind this if I liked
the ink flow, but it's just one more thing). I will give them that they're fast
and smooth and don't tend to skip or dry out, but for the same price I would
recommend the Platinum Preppy instead."
nday11,"December 27, 2010","Write very fast, very wet, very thick. My favorite pen. In a blind pen test I
would pick these cheapo pens over pens 10x the cost. Plus you can actually
refill them by using padded pliers to pull out the nib/body. And there's nothing
to cry over if you lose them."
onishii,"September 28, 2010","I must say I am very pleased with my results. The ink is a excellent dark and
rich black. I really enjoy writing with it whenever I get chance.The line is approximately 0.7mm thick. I'm not a fan of thick lines (0.5mm is my
friend!), but if you enjoy bold and disposable fountain pens, picking this up
would be an excellent idea.And let me tell you, these pens last a LONG time. I used one for seven to eight
months. Don't judge the ink by the clear window on the side! Even if it looks
empty, there's a good month left in the pen."
seawindbullies,"June 3, 2011","This is a great pen for the price. . . actually, better than some I've paid much
more for. It writes a smooth and juicy line, does not skip. I'm very pleased
with it."
bakugan08,"December 28, 2011","I really like this pen. It is the first fountain pen I have ever used. I really

from Jetpens."
Crowsie,"October 12, 2015","I originally purchased this pen to add to my art supply repertoire. I ended up
with a fine writing instrument. It's pretty beefy for a disposable pen, and the
ink goes on thick and dark, much more like a felt tip pen than a fountain pen.
It has a tendency to bleed, but that isn't a huge problem when you're writing. "
r_pendry,"September 22, 2015","About as much as one could ask for in a disposable fountain pen...elegant design
IMO and always seems to turn heads.  When it writes, it writes beautifully-
however, I have found it to have some consistency issues (as with most fountain
pens) that can be remedied only by holding it in a very particular way; there is
lots of re-writing to get the ink to come out when you first start learning how
to write with this one.  But you get what you pay for.  Despite this issue, I
would definitely recommend."
rahgnar.s,"July 30, 2014","I found one of these babies laying in the driveway of an abandoned house. It
must have been laying there quite a good time since the outside has quite an
amount of scratches. The inside however works like new. I love this pen, it
holds a special place in my heart right next to my Parker Jotter. It is
utilitarian, never leaks, looks a lot classier, and writes with a lot more
character than a regular ball point. It often surprises folks when I hand it to
them to sign things. It writes very smooth and very wet, no skipping at all. On
that same page, or maybe a different page. (haha) As with any liquid ink pen
that writes wet, you will have to consider paper choice when writing. Thinner
lower quality paper will bleed and feather badly. It will be replaced when it
runs dry. (or I may try to refill it as another user cleverly suggested)"
psattler,"September 30, 2015","This is supposed to be a first fountain pen for people.  I'm a ""new user""  Found
I had a lot of trouble getting it to right consistently even after googling and
reading ""how to write with a fountain pen"" and how to hold a fountain pen.  But maybe this is a skill I would develop over time.  But after 5 or 10 minutes
I couldn't consistently write what I wanted to.  It did put out nice dark readable lines when I managed to use it.  "
uscmelanie,"November 11, 2014","As a left-hander, one of the few fountain pens I have been able to use that has
smear-freedelivery of ink for me and delivers a consistent, smooth flow.  I love the
medium nib for calligraphy.  Wish that Pilot would make this refillable  - more
environmental friendly!  "
Rebecca,"December 10, 2009","Very smooth and dark ink. It almost feels marker-like over the paper...not
scratchy. It's a touch broader of a stroke than I'd like for regular writing,
but that's my only beef with it."
Christina,"September 9, 2015","Writes very smoothly for both print and script. I love this pen! My handwriting
is medium in both size and weight, and this nib fits the sizes of my letters
well. I usually write quickly, and the flow keeps up perfectly. People with
small handwriting, a slow or heavy hand might not find this pen suitable. The
ink opacity isn't completely consistent, but there's very little variation
overall. Bleeds slightly, but not enough to cause blurring."

refillable."
ricardusloganius,"July 21, 2013","After eschewing Fountain Pens for many years for various (and very tenuous
reasons) I bought a couple Preppys at a local Pen Store (I had to drive 3 hours
to find one...) and I found I actually liked writing with them.  Looking at
reviews of ""Beginner"" Fountain Pens I kept getting confronted with the Pilot
Varsity.  So I added one to my order.  When it arrived I found it nice to hold
and well balanced.  Writing with it was very nice.  It's really smooth and lays
down a nice dark line.  The only time I had any issues writing with it was when
I was writing on very bad or on the backside of heavily marked paper.  In this
instance I have had Ballpoint and Gel pens do the same!  I'm going to try taking
this to work, where I have to write a whole lot, and see how this handles.  I am
already looking into a ""Next Level"" Fountain Pen! "
josh_harle,"May 30, 2013"," The pen is okay. I don't really like it because it bleeds through paper more
then other inks, and sometimes it skips when you write the ink stops for a
second. I do like it because it is a good pen for notetaking. I'm a high school
student so i take alot of notes, and don't like to use my expensive pens because
they might get lost or stolen off my desk. Yea kids steal pens i got my G2 pens
stolen last week. Although if you want to use a fountain pen for other kinds of
writing. I suggest you get a pen that is refillable like to G2 Metropolitan pen
it comes with a converter. You will save money instead of just tossing this pen
when it runs out of ink."
Agata,"May 28, 2013","This product is quite affordable and good enough for the price, but the line it
makes is really heavy and it bleeds quite a bit. It's best used with heavier
paper which is more expensive and would probably be used in conjunction with a
higher quality pen. I bought two of these but I haven't used them much because
of how much they bleed."
Lapicerista,"April 27, 2013","My dad got very sad and angry at the idea of a disposable fountain pen. Is like
some oxymoron, usually fountain pens are forever, but nowadays we can find
anything in the market.  I got a bit sad at the thickness of the produced lines, very thick and not
useful for my cursive script. "
Agata,"January 4, 2013","This is a wonderful disposable fountain pen, and of really high quality for the
price. It is extremely wet and thick, so keep that in mind when you're
considering buying it. It bleeds through paper really quickly, unless you have
high quality paper."

easily refillable with cartridges. it's so fantastic you don't want to throw it
away!"
voodoocat,"September 30, 2009","Great pen for the money, however, it's only disposable if you throw it away! A
pair of thin needle nose pliers at a 90 degree angle close to the barrel and a
little finesse and this pen is refillable with any ink you want. Do this
operation over a sink and maybe wear and old shirt as the feed will throw a
little ink as you pull out the assembly."
arjensen42,"September 16, 2009","For the price, and seeing that this it is disposable, I'm quite impressed about
how well this pen performs. No ink blots, very minimal bleeding, and a sturdy
build are just a couple of great things about this pen. On a few types of papers
however, I've noticed that the ink does feather a little bit.  On a side note, I never saw a nib size listed. Upon receiving the pen, I noticed
the nib marked with an _M_. The nib width is just a little on the big side for
me, but the performance of this pen outweighs this fact, and I'll get used to it
soon enough."
saphirecoqui,"September 15, 2009","It's good to see these pens here. I bought two packs and used them all up, when

cm2127a,"June 22, 2009","I was very skeptical at first, because it is disposable. I can't believe how
well they write, they don't leave ink blots. I have also carried it in my
backpack and it never once broke (if you knew me you would understand how hard I
am on my products). I was fearful because I have other pens explode on me. The downsides: the pen is not refillable, there is no cartage. The ink is great
for 95% of paper. The other 5% it may bleed, not though, but around the letters.

Nick,"December 11, 2022","I can't recommend that pen enough. It's an extremely inexpensive fountain pen
that doesn't bring all the disadvantages of the fountain pen, but still provides
some flair in the writing. It's basically an eyedropper. Personally, I refil it
by removing the feed (you may need to use a set of pliers), which makes it super
environmentally friendly and holds a large amount of ink, about 2ml."

given a few away to people that were curious about writing with a fountain pen.

track of it better than a regular pen, but if I lost it, it would only be $3-4
out the door instead of more for a real fountain pen.  I accidentally ordered
the medium point, which is broader than I prefer, but still way better than a

redefines what you can expect in an affordable fountain pen. There is no
comparison in quality, plus you also get the ability to use bottles inks with
the Metropolitan. If all you want though is a super-cheap disposable fountain pen, this one is
probably the best in that segment. "

iblamesummers,"January 28, 2016","the Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen was one of three inexpensive, beginner
fountain pens -- the other two being the JetPens Chibi 2 & Jinhao 599a -- that
were my 1st introduction into fountain pens; of those three, it holds the
dubious distinction of being both my least favorite but also the fountain pen
I've learned the MOST from, in a ""You gotta start somewhere""-sorta way.  Most of
the obvious criticisms are true: the medium nib is overly thick, very wet,
bleedthru-prone & obviously feathers. et cetera.  But this pen is very good at
reverse writing & I have not experienced hard starts, railroading, or a dried
out nib.   In retrospect, I sometimes end up wondering if this was the 1st beginner Pilot I
should have gotten.  Or should I have gone w/ the 
Kakuno/Petite/Plumix/Metropolitan.  the Pilot Varsity also makes me wonder if I
should trouble myself w/ another round of beginner fountain pens or ""next level
up.""  I also wonder if, when this pen runs out, should I just throw it away, or
spend an afternoon looking at Youtube vidz on how to refill it.  And I think
that's what is most interesting about the Pilot Varsity, for an inexpensive,
beginner, disposable fountain pen, it sure-as-Hell makes me WONDER..."

to large size. Doesn't really bleed ink that much, smudging happens on bad paper
just as all pens. Honestly it is a good pen for beginners, I wouldn't reccomend
anything else under $5.sd"
DallasisaLeo,"August 25, 2010","I'm honestly quite shocked at the high ratings this pen has received. The nib is
the kind with a round tip, so you can't vary the line thickness at all. It's a
shame, too, because these are the thickest fountain pens I've ever used.
Finally, the ink flow is ridiculously heavy, making it horrible for note-taking
because your words bleed together and often bleed through the paper as well.
Maybe you could use these for writing on posters, but on plain notebook paper
it's just a pain. I'll edit this review if I eventually find a good use for them, but for now
they're a waste of space."

and since I already have a TWSBI 580 in a Medium nib I knew I'd need to justify
this one with a different nib size, so I went with the 1.1 stub italic. This is
my first pen of that nib size as I'm relatively new to the hobby (got into it
around Xmas '21) and OMG, absolutely love what this does for my handwriting!
This is going to stay in my inked rotation of pens all the time now, starting
with a thank-you card for the person who gifted me this for my b-day. If you've
been wanting this pen colorway but weren't into the vacuum fill option, get this
one - it has the high-capacity, clip, and comfortable size that I love about my
existing 580 in a bold new statement body. I don't think I'll be comfortable
taking it to work (too appealing to sticky fingers), but this will get a
prominent display on my home desk."
TamarN,"October 16, 2022","Love these pens. They are gorgeous. I use the stub for Italic Calligraphy.
I’ve heard complaints about how horrible TWSBI stub nibs are, but they work
perfectly for me. I am newbie to the fountain pen world though. The ink capacity
in these pens are one of the biggest highlights for me. "
Elle,"January 9, 2023","When I first bought Zebra Clickart pens, I chose from the LT set in hopes some
of the colors were pastel. Though the colors in that set were still too bright
to be true pastels, I loved the pens and how perfectly they worked for me.Once this pastel set was released, I immediately grabbed. I'm happy to say that
I now have those pretty light pastels I was looking for!!Like the previously-released sets, the pens are retractable and write well. I
keep them in a cotton breathable pouch where they can get moisture from the air.
I've had the original colors for over a year and they haven't dried out - so I
expect the same from these pastels.In terms of colors, they're just dreamy! Legible on white paper, and a rainbow
of the sweetest shades. My favorites are Pale Rose and Soda Blue. "
kwyjibo4,"August 3, 2022","ANOTHER WINNER from the Zebra Clickart pens line !! The new colors are light but
so so so pretty and of course the amazingly satisfying click. I like not having
to keep track of a pen cap, rolling off my desk and no worries over drying out.
GREAT pens!"
elizabeth.aveda,"August 19, 2022",These are amazing for note taking and color coding! 
Eliza,"May 14, 2019","I love this pen. It's very cute externally, and it writes like a dream. I mostly
use fountain pens, but this pen is a fantastic alternative, in my opinion. It
has a nice ink flow that dries pretty quickly, and works even on my super cheap
school paper. The ink is a very dark blue, and often appears to be more black,
and is perfect for taking notes and writing timed essays. The line size is
perfect for me (as someone who prefers a fine nib), and I really don't have any
complaints. I value it as much as some of my cheaper fountain pens- it's that
good. Also, the grip is very comfortable.10/10, I definitely recommend. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this
pen."
perrin,"October 25, 2019","I've become a huge fan of Pentel EnerGel pens thanks to JetPens' guide for
left-handers. The Clena bodies are super cute while also being sophisticated,
and I love the blue-black ink as an alternative to my usual black. I'm generally
a fan of wider tip sizes so the 0.5mm is my favorite--nice and smooth for a
left-hander who tends to get more feedback from pens than right-handers might
experience."

any bleeding.  Also love the look of the pen too.  I will get it again."

bold. I took a star away due to the pen being plastic. I thought the casing was
metal. It’s also a nice looking pen, but if it was made with metal it would be
much more “appealing”. The plastic makes it look cheap. Overall, a nice
everyday pen. "

friendly artist,"June 24, 2021","I was worried when I found that my previous standby, the original Pilot Pocket
Brush Pen, was listed as discontinued... but I'm happy to report that the
Shunpitsu is just the Pocket, but with ink that dries faster. I don't know about
it drying ""in just one second""-- it takes more like 5 for thick lines-- but the
original Pocket took more like two full minutes and was prone to smearing all
over my sketchbook, so this is a major upgrade.This is an excellent, water-soluble pen for sketching. It's got a rubbery tip
that I've never seen on another pen, and it doesn't fray at all. You can get
hair-thin lines with it over the full life of the pen, and still lay in big
black areas at speed. To contrast, the Pentel Pocket Brush Pen is much drier
with much thicker thins, and the Faber-Castell PITT Artist Brush Pen can't hold
its tip for more than one use before it starts acting like a regular marker.That said, if you have a heavy or shaky hand, forget about the hair-thin lines.
This pen is so soft that when you're making a thin line, you often literally
cannot feel the pen against the paper, so heavy-handed folks should consider a
harder nib. It also can get a little wiggly if you're not quick and decisive,
and it has an unusual little quirk that shows up when you try and make thick
horizontal strokes-- little sharp points like cat ears at the ends of each thick
line. Teoh Yi Chie has an excellent YouTube review of the original Pilot Pocket
Brush Pen that shows this in action.That said, I still give it five stars. My go-to pen for animal sketching-- it's
bold, fun and speedy, with lots of personality. Well worth the learning curve.TL;DR: Good pen."
slippek,"November 1, 2020","This is a felt tipped brush pen that's fine for many applications, but for me it
is outshined by the Pentel Pocket Brush. It is fairly juicy, with a somewhat
opaque ink that runs toward the charcoal grey, not the darkest black. The nib is
on the flexible side but much firmer than true bristle brush pens. I like that
you csn see how much ink it has, but it seemed to run dry fairly quickly. I can
imagine it being good for lettering practice and sketching, but for me it's not
black enough or precise enough for a finished work.    "
Drewskaya,"March 26, 2021","The BEST!I cannot get enough of these brush pens. I love the soft brush the best, but the
""hard"" pens in black and gray are amazing. The pens are ""juicy"" and the ink
flows readily.  I used one for a solid 20 minutes today and I only had one line
that was streaky.  As soon as I turned the pen to a new spot on the tip, the ink
flowed perfectly again. They last a long time and I really like the intensity of
the black ink. Great for art and writing."
acubicfox,"November 8, 2022","This is the only ink pen I have that can go through my sketchbook's ~100gsm
paper if you hold it there and let it pool. That's a testament to just how much
ink it's letting through, and it also makes it feel closer to an actual brush
that's been freshly dipped. Many brush pens will compromise a little more
towards the side of ""pen"" than ""brush"" and can give a decent taper effect when
pressed, but don't give quite so much control when going light and fast, so it's
nice to have this as an option."

almost mad! the only issue I have is that the ink bleeds through paper that's
not heavy mix media paper VERY quickly so it's not sketchbook friendly. but for
solo inking projects or with copics? *chef kiss* love it to death"
idyll.wind,"April 26, 2021","Great for people who have a little more experience using a brush pen, as the
softness of the brush pen tip makes it trickier to control. Lays down ink
beautifully and is great for calligraphy, especially if you're writing larger
words/characters."
chizoo,"April 1, 2021","Ah! So great! The tip is just Divine and soft! And the pen is not so big either, it's small but not too small. The ink is rich
and thick, the bending on the brush twist and moves with your wrist and glides
on the page like a ice skater. I would buy more later before it gets out of stock! I strongly recommend this if you like thickness. "
christiegu94,"December 23, 2020","I love how fast the ink dries on these. It's almost instant! They are great for
alcohol markers. The soft tip is actually bigger than the hard tip. I would call
the hard tip a ""fine"" brush pen and the soft tip one a ""medium"" sized brush pen."
Quichi,"December 16, 2020","only drawback is that wish I could control the amount of ink. It will either
give a thick, rich black line when full or an artsy, faded black line near the
end. I cant seem to get the artsy faded line on purpose."

geisk,"October 8, 2022","I absolutely love this pen! I also own a glass dip pen and the writing
experience seems a bit smoother with this pen. I purchased it for the purpose of
sampling my inks and writing brief notes. I used Waterman Intense Black, and was
quite pleased with the results. There were no drips or smudges on Rhodia paper,
and the ink flowed smoothly. I was able to write at least three or four full
sentences before having to dip the pen again. There's no guesswork as to when
the nib is about to run out of ink. I would prefer a better cover for the nib,
rather than the tiny rubber sleeve that comes with it. Otherwise, it's a simple,
yet elegant dip pen, nicely balanced, comfortable to hold, and works quite well.
If you like dip pens, I recommend buying it."
vinnyjrandazzo,"October 26, 2022","This was my first time using a dip pen.It took me a hot second to get the hang of it. Once I did I was pretty

tip loaded it writes for an amazing long time. Very cool."

still love it."
Btshails,"October 12, 2020","Very light pen. Definitely not the one for some that likes heft in the hand with
a fountain pen. Perfect length and weight when posted if thats your preference.
The grip is like a less extreme version of the lamy safari, with grooves to
encourage proper tripod grip. I would give it maybe 6/10 for smoothness (coming
from someone who likes buttery smooth nibs) which is honestly pretty good for a
fine nib pen. I would call this a true fine so you may have a bit of a problem
with super thick or sparkly inks in this nib size but for most of your standard
inks itll be just fine. I kind of forget about this one in my collection because
I have ones I just like better but its an okay little pen."
winksandgiggles89,"August 31, 2020","This pens writes as dreamily as my other Kawecos, is comfortable to write with,
and looks snappy, but the cap seems to cause some weird leaking.  If I have to
cap and un-cap the pen several times in a short amount of time it seems to
encourage extra ink to get pulled out the tip from the friction (or if there's
suction going on maybe it's that) and then once the cap is off the extra ink has
gotten all over the inside of the cap, which means it also gets all over the
grip. It didn't leak in general, as when I would have longer bouts of writing
without taking the cap on and off it was fine. I'll probably still use this baby
for my school notes but this issue makes it ill-suited for using it at work for
me."

ink began to flow way too fast.  There was ink pooled in the cap that came out
when I opened the top, and the ink flows out way too fast from the nib.  I dont
know what happened - certainly there was no mistreatment!  Anyone else had this
experience?"

Tangle List,"September 9, 2018","This review is for those who can't decide between the 0.5 and 0.38 versions of
the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen. The 0.5 simply glides better across my
journal. That's perfect for fast, free-flowing writing, but my penmanship
suffers as a result. The 0.38 version, in my opinion, has a better balance
between smooth writing and producing neat penmanship. I prefer the 0.38 for
journaling because it's looks nicer while rereading old journal entries. The
smaller writing also saves a considerable amount of journal space.   The bottom line, though, is that they're both excellent, 5-star pens and worth
every penny. Buy one of each and see what meets your personal needs better. "
Some Rainstorms,"December 21, 2018",Average pen. Not as smooth as people act like it is. It's just kind of okay. 
Jenna H,"October 15, 2014","After hearing such great comments about this pen, I decided to check it out. I
have to admit, I was a little disappointed when it started skipping sometimes
and accumulating ink blobs on the tip occasionally. Also, the ink doesn't last
too long if you're someone who is planning on using this pen to take notes every
day; mine is almost out after about 3 months of regular note-taking. However,
when it it writes well, the results are pretty awesome; dark, black ink and your
hand feeling happy as it glides effortlessly across the paper. Bottom line is:
if you're looking for a medium-to-bold gel pen for note-taking, this pen is
right for you!"

vertical) angle -- uncomfortable for me, but probably correct for most people --
this pen is great. For ""low-angle"" people like me, try the Pentel EnerGel
series, which seem to have greater (and easier) ink flow. I've been using 05 on
cheap paper, but now that I'm buying better paper from Jet Pens will try a
smaller point."
Lapicerista,"April 28, 2013","Excellent gel ink pen, among the best and includes a rubber grip. Very good dark
black color. "
jasonwrites,"July 29, 2009","Love these. Like others, I thought the Hi Tec .05mm was going to be my fave
(writing and journal work for me) but this is the best yet. Very comfortable and
great flow without being too heavy and no bleed through. Blue black is a
wonderful color, I'll be trying the brown-black next!"

kpohka,"May 20, 2022","The pen did not deliver the ink smoothly onto the paper.  It kept getting stuck
and I had to heat the tip to either clear or loosen the bearing at the tip for
the ink to come out.  But it was doing this consistently and I just gave up
using it. I wanted to use this pen as a writing pen or signature pen. 
Disappointed considering the 3mm pen I purchased writes very smoothly."
katieduran76,"March 10, 2022","This is like surprisingly bad. I've heard a lot of good things about this pen.

still great."
intoteacups,"February 8, 2022","I often find thinner pens a bit awkward/uncomfortable to hold, but I felt no
discomfort with this one. I think the case is actually a bit larger than it

solid black and flows nicely."

jpassamano,"October 25, 2021","There may be no better gel ink pen that Uniball Signo. You will be more than satisfied with the build-quality if the pen, the weight,
the long writing comfort, the smoothness and quality of the ink and writing
point, the crispness of the line of ink, and the evenness of the ink flow.  All
of this for less than $3. Plus a variety of colors."
boopboopbeep,"September 29, 2021","I was excited for this pen because I've previously use the 0.38mm in the same
color and it works really well 5 stars but for this one it skips a lot but I'm
not sure if it's the paper I use which are the kokuyo campus notebooks and
kokuyo campus looseleaf (sarasara) and I thought it would be fine because smooth
paper works way better for gel pens that I own anyway and I've never had an
issue with it but for this pen it wasn't great also another reviewer also
mentioned that it leaves ink blobs which is also another problem with this pen.
I also bought the brown and blue black in 0.5 and I have no issues with that so
take that as you will.These are other pens I recommend in 0.5zebra sarasa clip - blackzebra sarasa mark on - blackpilot juice - black pentel eiergel - blackuni-ball Jetstream - black (however this is a ballpoint pen)"

lindsayr08,"September 8, 2020","I'm not crazy about the 0.5 UM-151 gel pen.  Not sure if I got a bad one but the

black and blue black though and love those ones."

pen, I'm now a changed person and will definitely be buying more Uni-Ball pens.
I've always had problems with Zebra Sarasa pens being inconsistently smooth or
scratchy. This pen is always smooth, no skipping and easy to hold. If you like
Muji pens, you'll like this! I recommend this to everyone who is curious or
wants a smooth-writing pen! The .38mm version is a little scratchier, but that
is to be expected since it is a smaller tip. Stick with this one!"

plywoodspoiler,"January 18, 2020","Not good for writing on both sides of paper, writing on the other side presses
the ink in the back onto the next sheet of paper. It makes kind of a carbon copy
wherever you cross over the writing on the other side. Other than that it seems
like a great pen.Does anyone know of an option that is archival, waterproof, and does not do
this?"

Rick Davis,"November 4, 2019","I thought that I would would really like this pen but I have had problems with
skipping. It may just be the .5mm though. I have not tried any other widths.
When it doesn't skip it writes well with a nice feel and dark ink. I have not
had any trouble with smearing which is nice. "
atessandore,"October 17, 2019","The UM-151 0.5mm is my favorite pen. There's no bleeding of the ink and your
writing remains crisp and clear. In both English and Japanese, my handwriting is
quite tiny, and these pens ensure it remains legible due to the ink not bleeding
or feathering on the paper. I've used the black, blue, light blue, green,
purple, and red - all of them are great quality, and I have one set for my
office and one for personal use."
rherren,"October 8, 2019","Good pen. A little skippy, though, meaning I don't always get a solid line when
I want it. I still like it a lot."
ecorwell,"October 2, 2019","Everyone has been saying how great this pen is, but I really wasn't that excited
about it. It has good ink flow, and the pen has a nice weight and design, but
the tip is scratchy. If you're writing English and not chinese or japanese
characters, it doesn't seem like the right pen to use. You'd need to hold it
upright more. But it is a good pen, I use it on really smooth paper and that
cuts down on any drag. "
meaghan,"September 20, 2019","Very smooth and solid lines. The ink dry-time is not the best, but it's

leftyjimmie,"May 14, 2019","I've spent too much time and money trying to find the perfect pen. As a lefty,
gel pens are my go-to, but I also like having a fine line. I use .5mm tips
whenever I can find them, but I've struggled to find a gel pen in that size that
wasn't scratchy or skipped when writing quickly. And clicking pens is an
annoying nervous habit of mine, so I prefer capped pens whenever possible. But
the search is over!This pen writes fantastically: the ink flows well (no scratches or skips), dries
fast (no stains on the side of my hand), and doesn't smear when I go over it
with a highlighter (yay legible planner/notes). Plus, now that I know I'm never
buying another type of pen, I can also get it in colors besides black, blue, and
red!"
Bbski,"April 17, 2019","I’ve been using these pens for my fine art drawings for the past two years.
They’re terrific. The lines are crisp and clean and I can vary the line
quality by varying the pressure and angle of stroke. The ink is really black and
gives depth and richness to my work. I use the .28, .38, .05 and broad nib and
all work really well. Only wish they made another wider point. To see what these
pens can do check out bbskidraws.com"
aquagirl072,"February 25, 2019","The ink is very smooth, but I grip my pens close to the tip, so the pen is
uncomfortable to hold. That is disappointing because I really like the way the
pen writes, but it hurts when I write with it."

a.moralesl16,"July 21, 2018","I've heard a lot of good reviews on this pen, and it met all my expectations."
taimdala,"April 28, 2018","Excellent pen! Silky and smooth for effortless writing, it's got the added
benefit of being waterproof. I bought these to do my layouts in my bullet
journal and so far, they've held up really well after weeks and weeks of making
lines and circles and boxes. The metal construction of the tip is the
kicker--it's far more durable than plastic. I would give this pen series 5 stars if I could get it as a retractable: the
caps present an extra detail I must keep track of and imposes a two-hand action
to use the pen. HOWEVER, the cap fits nice and tight and there is an audible
click when posting it or capping the pen. This saves the pen from getting ony a
3 star review, bumping it up to 4.That said, I'm trying really really hard not to get one in every color ...
because I don't think I'll have room in my house if I did. LOL! These pens
really are a favorite of mine."
Raine M,"March 23, 2018","My absolute favorite gel pen in the whole wide world. I have multiples of these;

ADR in NY,"January 29, 2018","What can one say about Signo ink pens? They're simply one of the best inks
available. Of this particular pen, I prefer the larger tip size, the
transparency of the cap's clip, and the rubber grip which offers more comfort.
Now, if we can just get the maker to offer the 0.5's in some of the same colors
that are found with the 0.38 such as the Prussian Blue and the rest of the
Off-Black colors. You cannot go wrong with this pen."

ruoxuanshao,"February 11, 2017","It's so smooth! A definite improvement over the UM-100, I've had no problems
with the ink pooling or skipping. The grip is also a lot more comfortable. The
only problem I had with it is that the ink has a semi-glossy finish which
doesn't suit my tastes."
syd05,"January 29, 2017","I got this to use primarily for writing notes during class; it works
WONDERFULLY. I always write with my hand on the page, so any ink usually smudges
quite easily. Not with this pen. I can write with my hand on the page because
the ink dries so quickly. Also, the ink is really smooth and I haven't
encountered any dry parts. Usually, pens like G2 Pens, for example, have ink
that gushes out or dry parts (from my experience). This pen always provides the
perfect amount of ink. I HIGHLY recommend this pen -- especially to anyone who
writes with their hand on the paper. "
noahjaybee,"December 12, 2016","Writes great, but I bought this pen because I thought it said smear-proof/dries
permanent. It takes a really long time (for my use) to dry and I cannot use a
highlighter over it...it smudges like any other gel pen. So I won't be using it
the way I want to, but I'm sure I'll use it for everyday writing."
mijinii1203,"November 11, 2016","I think I would enjoy this one more on a smaller tip size, but otherwise very

sometimes when i write and makes blank parts on my letters, but this only
happens occasionally so its bearable"

jamm,"March 7, 2016","I'm not a huge gel pen fan... but if I'm going to get a stick gel pen, this
Signo 0.5 is the one. I've tried many variations of this -- and I find the 0.5
is a great balance. The 0.38 is too scratchy IMO, and the 0.7 is just too thick
and thus takes a bit longer to dry on some papers... so this 0.5 is the right
balance for me. Excellent all-around gel stick pen, and even better than the
""famous"" 0.38 version that gets glowing reviews on websites IMO."

maxr,"January 17, 2019","Great small pen. The card fits perfectly in my card case wallet (which I doubt I
can name according to the review guidelines). A note to future readers: if you
buy this and want to replace the ink with another D1 refill, you may notice the
end of the original refill is a bit wider. That's a cap you'll need to remove
and replace on the new refill. Otherwise, the spring will never retract
properly."
HaPo,"January 25, 2018","LOVE this pen. One of my most useful purchases-- it's invaluable to always have
a pen on you. It also writes surprisingly well for what it is and seems to have

hope this comes back in stock so I can order a back-up!"
wolskiman,"April 16, 2016","Fits exactly in any credit card sized holder. Great little release button for

planner or pocket without any worry."
SoCal Giant,"August 25, 2022","Setting the right expectations is important in evaluating this pen.  I saw
someone give it two stars while saying you can't write more than one or two
sentences at a time.  This pen was never meant to be used to write an essay or a
long report.  It's designed for jotting down quick notes of a few words at a
time, and that it does adequately.  The credit-card sized holder is an ingenious
addition that enables me to carry this pen comfortably in my wallet.  It's nice
to have a writing utensil anywhere you might need one."

office has been invaluable. I didn't realize how many times I NEED a pen on the

It doesn't leak or explode or anything. It is REFILLABLE! And it goes with me
everywhere. It's bailed me out of multiple airport forms on airplanes and not
having a pen at a check out counter. If you are not sure what to get someone who
is a minimalist or something, This is a great idea. It writes the first time
every time too. I am so pleased with this. "
Emma,"July 23, 2022","Sure, it small enough that you could pick your teeth with it, but it writes

wallet in pocket but hopefully this won't be an issue since I put my wallet in
my front pocket."
Not Skynet,"June 13, 2022","I mostly got this because it’s adorable…But I ended up using it A LOT,

card carrier and into my tiny woman pockets."

gabbottiii,"November 8, 2021","I love this holder. I bought it to keep a pen with my slim money clip style
wallet. Unfortunately this card is larger than your standard credit card, I
found I had to cut of a bit of plastic from each side (probably around 4mm
total) to have it properly fit into the card slot. I am currently using it to
hold my Kaweco sport, it works very well since the kaweco clip prong fits easily
into the pen tube. The ohto pen is a nice pen, but I don't like the feel of how
thin it is when writing and will prefer to use other pens with the card."
Rotsterne,"August 1, 2021","I love miniature things, and useful things, and this is the best of both! It
takes up almost no space at all in my wallet, and has already come in handy

bbrachman,"February 4, 2020","While a good idea, too thin is too thin.  I could not imagine writing with this
pen for more than a sentence or two.  It is difficult to hold."
porchcat70,"November 15, 2019","I have always enjoyed miniaturized versions of everyday objects, this pen is a
lot of fun.  In a pinch, I could write out a check with it or sign something. 
When I ordered it I also ordered an ink refill, no telling how long one will
last me.  Keeping this in my coat pocket."

MrTomRN,"April 30, 2019",Most amazing and cute pen. Writes very well. Easy to carry. Well made. 
capazL,"April 5, 2019","Very, very cute. Very portable. But for the cost, the ink doesn't come out
well--thin, then a blob, then thin. For this reason it smears easily and doesn't
look good on paper. Very very cute--I wish they would fix this."
romulo.vascon,"February 13, 2019","Even considering the category that this pen belongs to, it is incredibly small
and lightweight. I carry mine inside my small wallet. Good writing and very
useful for unpredictable situations. Of course it is not suitable for intense
use, but perfect for signing documents anywhere, filling out visa forms on
flights or take quick notes."
Minty,"February 4, 2019","Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who likes to carry a pen on him. He loves

rwplarson,"August 2, 2017","Perfect for my wallet. I don't understand why every man in America doesn't carry
this. Shipping was quick and product is great!  Buy this!!!"
Claire,"June 1, 2017","Really nice pen. Writes okay, nothing special, but for a pen its size it's a
trade-off. I keep it and a Rhodia No. 10 notebook in my pocket - the pen is 9 cm
long and the notebook is 5.2 x 7.5 cm, so it's really convenient to jot things
down. I use it to keep track of my assignments for school. I'm comfortable
writing with it for longer periods of time, though I do have small hands; most
people would probably prefer to use it just for writing things down quickly."
neillcurrie,"March 15, 2016","Does exactly what is expected of a pen just slightly longer than the length of a
credit card, not without it's compromises though.......somewhat difficult to
hold being the main one. Writes with a pretty fine line that may be tricky on
thin paper. Seems solidly made."
mrcrystal,"January 9, 2015",Excellent!  Beyond expectations!!!
shockbeton,"August 28, 2013","Such a wonderful thing this is! It fits perfectly in a man's wallet. Now I
always have something to write with even when I forget to bring a 'real' pen.
The design is so clean and simple too."
senorsneaky,"May 13, 2020","I’m impressed by the fit and finish of this piece. It’s extremely solid and
well made. The training on the steel is super consistent and wraps around the
body and cap in a way that produces a subtle shimmer from certain angles. The
effect is awesome and is really only visible up close!4 stars because the tip is actually a hair too tight for some Parker style
refills, which is pretty frustrating. "
mybills48054,"October 25, 2022","I love the size and robustness of Kaweco “Metal” Sport pens. The Steel Sport
appears to be lighter than the Brass Sport, but heavier than both the Aluminum
(AL) Sport and the non-metal Sports pens.Fit and finish are super well done. The cap must be twisted less than one
complete turn to cap/uncap the pen, and most people will want to post the cap on
the back of the pen to make it more comfortable to write with. One thing that surprised me was that the pen felt gritty when I got it, as if
there was a fine layer of sand on the outer surface. That has since gone away
through frequent use, but the Steel Sport still feels grippier than either my AL
or Brass Sport pens. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this pen, and now use it as a substitute for
my old Spacepen (after swapping the very smooth Kaweco cartridge for a not so
smooth but more all-condition Spacepen pressurized refill (PR1 Blue). "
rlange99,"September 30, 2022","This may seem odd, but I actually purchased this pen to use as a ballpoint.I have various needs for a ballpoint but usually find them slippery and
imprecise.The Kaweco Gel Roller can use standard G2 type ballpoint refills.The pen's weight in steel requires absolutely no pressure in writing as wellas offering great stability.Of course, the form factor makes for a highly convenient carry."
smithl325749,"June 18, 2022","Excellent build and weight.  I substitute the Lamy ink refill  with A Gel refill
from pilot or uni. I also have a pen kit to make any refill work (a kit for
interchangeable refills.  A must have for pen snobs)."
ozzy,"September 15, 2021","Oh it's excellent. It's genuinely much smaller than I'd expected but I probably
just have big hands lol. The Steel Sport has a wonderful weight and feel that helps me kind of drift in
the way I write and draw, despite what some may see in a heavy pen I think it's
to this small pen's advantage. I'd also like to mention that the Schmidt P900 Ballpoint is a perfect fit for
folks looking to exchange the Kaweco 0.7 Roller refill with a Ballpoint,
something that sadly hasn't had much mention in other reviews. As for durability I think with this pen only having five pieces altogether with
three of those being the Steel casing, you'd not have much to worry about, I'm
expecting to have this pen for a long, long time!"
amydaytrader,"January 1, 2021","Writes very smoothly. Pen is nice and heavy. It feels expensive and luxurious.
Would buy again :)"
Michael P,"August 15, 2019","This German product  gives you a "" license to write"" and the company is in
business since 1883. Looks like a quality pen to be sure! The only ""fault"" if
any , is the petite nature of the pen itself. I am very delighted and you will
be too. Should be a nice simple "" every day carry"" item."
iamlex.ma,"July 30, 2019","Top notch writing utensil.  Native gel ink is extra smooth.  Pen is compact and
easy to carry around.The only downside is that the cap occasionally gets slightly stuck on end of
pen.  "
Janelle G,"July 17, 2019","This is my third Sport rollerball, after the brass and stonewashed aluminum
models, and is equally high quality. I was carrying the aluminum pen in my
pocket every day, and often the threads between the cap and barrel and between
the grip and barrel would partially unscrew in my pocket, so I was continually
having to tighten them. After a month of daily carry, I haven't had that issue
with the steel model. It's been in my pocket with keys and other metal things,
and the finish no longer has the new brushed steel look but it's not scratched
as a softer metal would have been. I prefer the heavier weight of the brass and
steel models to the aluminum, and balance feels good in my hand.The included refill is good, but I prefer a thinner line. The Uni UMR-85N worked
well in my previous pen, but the tip moved a little as I wrote. I'll be trying
other compatible refills on my next order."
abjching,"May 11, 2019","I love the pen. It writes very well Parker ink. I love the design due to its
compact size. "
geoff,"May 9, 2019","Fabulous compact roller ball that expands to full size when posted. If you like
a heavy pen that can carry in a pants pocket, here you are. "
ltgargaz,"February 27, 2019","I have three versions of this pen -- the stainless steel, the aluminum, and the
plastic.  Guess which two I kept and which one I gave to my wife?  These are
GREAT pens and the Kaweco gel refill is excellent.  Fortunately, the pen also
accepts the (excellent) Parker Gel refills, which are exactly the same size as
the Kaweco -- and cost about half the price.  This pen should last forever --
assuming refills remain available.  Yes, it heavier than the other models but I
like it.  I'll probably use the midnight black aluminum for travel because it is
so light.  Kaweco does a great job and their prices are reasonable."
PenGuy,"September 13, 2018","These pens are fantastic. My other Kaweco Sports are aluminum. The steel version
is bit heavy but well made and excellently balanced. Best pocket pen on the
market. "
scwest,"December 28, 2017","What a great pen. Super smooth and a very wet <M>.  The vacuum filler is way
cool and one stroke fills the pen about 2/3 full which is a lot of ink.  Mine
suffered from baby's bottom and missed the first half of a 't' down stroke about
10% of the time. A couple of minutes on the buffing pads eliminated this and it
is still wet and super smooth. The pens is light and well balanced whether
posted or not. The gold nib is gorgeous. I like the semi-transparent body so
it's easy to see how much ink if left. The clip is plenty tight and the rounded
ball make it snap onto the top of my pocket well. Writing is effortless. My only
wish would be for a <MF> point. At first I thought I would not like keeping the
rear of the pen unscrewed, but I've quickly gotten used to it.Also jetpens was great. I first ordered a fine but changed my mind. They were
able to catch the order before it went out the door, refunded my card, and then
I purchased the <M>. Shipping was fast."
barrettwbenton,"November 3, 2022","So nice, bought it twice...Well, in fact, make that *three* times, on account of my first one inexplicably
going missing a handful of years ago, which was a sad, not to mention rather
expensive loss. But I loved the thing so much that I bucked the ""temptation of
novelty"" and bought a second 823 (Black, like the first one), instead of
something else, this time with a Fine nib. That felt a bit different from the
Medium, with just a bit more tooth which at first was briefly disconcerting (my
issue with FPs in the past was with their being either *so* smooth they lacked
control for consistent handwriting, or so scratchy as to be highly unpleasant to
write with at all). The Fine nib turned out to be terrific for me, but the
bigger reveal for me was that the only thing better for my writing than a single
823 was two of them (and a Vanishing Point for quick note-taking and such). For
just a touch of variety, the companion 823 I chose was in Amber with Medium nib;
amusingly, I'd gotten so used to the Fine nib that writing with the Medium was
now slightly strange, but the memory of the first 823 came back quickly, and all
was good. If you know of the 823, you likely know its oft-mentioned virtues:
comfortable shape for extensive writing, fine-tuned nibs that write beautifully
straight from out of the box, seriously-large ink capacity via an elegantly
simple and efficient filling system, flawless fit and finish, and aesthetics
that are pleasing to the eye but not fussy or overwrought. In other words,
something a serious writer would happily reach for, very often. I certainly
can't ask for more in a good pen."

barrettwbenton,"November 3, 2022","The Elemental Fountain Pen""Elemental"" as in getting the basics not only ""right"", but done practically to a
fare-thee-well: a weight, balance and heft that's ""just right"", whether posted
or not (at least for me, and I generally post mine), ink capacity that's
legendary by now, filled by an elegantly simple and reliable plunger mechanism,
a warm-to-the-touch body that feels right in the hand, with a translucence that
allows assessment of ink supply without screaming ""demonstrator"", and, to that
end, an overall aesthetic that's pleasing without being overbearing. The thing
was clearly designed for *writing* as opposed to pocket jewelry, and with that
there isn't much more to say."
ahoffmeister198,"December 17, 2022","I had been wanting to try pilot juice gel pens for awhile now, so when I saw the
LE Pokémon I had to buy them. The colors are right up my alley, I can’t
decide which one I like more. I will say I was a little nervous, seeing as the
word juice was in the title…. I use Tomoe river paper pretty often and I was
worried about smudging and them taking forever to dry. Happy to report they

skying,"May 12, 2013","I've used these pens to illustrate on surfboards, wood, and heavy bristol. For
these applications, I love working with them. While the paint is water-based and
can seem thin in certain colors (particularly the white), they are capable of
very nice layering effects and offer up nice color. If you visit the Posca (UK I
think) website, they have a downloadable material list using a 5 point rating
scale to gauge performance on many different materials such as metal, wood and
glass. Easily the best water-based paint markers I've used."
candiceoen,"November 10, 2014","The colors of these markers are exceptional. They can be blended to make tints

do only write for pleasure and slowly. I like to write small and was struggling to find a fountain pen that matched my

sbstn111,"August 7, 2021","I love this pen so much. I started with the 0.5 mm Drafting Pencil option in the
same color but damaged the lead sleeve from dropping it so much at work that I
went with the pen hoping it would hold up better. I use it constantly at my work
and LOVE many things about this pen. Firstly has to be the weight of the pen
body, this part has a very solid construction. The pen feels great in my hand,
handles my heavy handedness when writing and placing it on the counter, along
with impressing any customers watching me use the pen. Plus, deep greens are
some of my favorite colors so those parts really hit 5stars.I do however wish the... cap?... where you click the pen... was sturdier. The
action is great, but the thin hollow cap which you press is kind of thin.
Depending on the angle I'm hitting it to click the pen in or out, it can stick
and not move meaning you need to try again to click it. Not a reason to not buy
the pen, but really my only main gripe about my writting experience. Has not
made me switch this as one of my daily writing tools. I am also nearing the end
of my (preinstalled) ink cartridge and will be exploring other brands of refills
if that says anything. Not sure how other compatible inks compete."
megalonyx,"May 20, 2021","This pen is equal to the original 600, which I used until the threads stripped

addresses.  It has been inked with the pigment ink for over a year without any
major cleaning and still works.This is a truly amazing pen for the price.  Yes, I have purchased more."
vyacosta,"April 17, 2013","This is my first fountain pen. I like the small size and the nib is not too
thick. I usually write with .38 pens and this is probably the equivalent of a
.5. I used it on my Moleskine journal and there is some bleedthrough so I might not
use this one as my everyday pen on my Moleskine. Overall good for the price but I'll definitely try something a bit thinner."
koningre,"December 9, 2014","These pens have a remarkably good nib for a small pocket pen. The cap posts
securely and fits securely over the nib with a water-tight seal greatly reducing
drying out of the nib. The cartridges are small but have a good strong seal to
the pen compared to the ""standard"" cartridges in many other brands. The opening
of the cartridge allows easy eye-dropper refilling from bottled ink. I have
never had a leak from these pens. I have never had a crack in the plastic though
carried in a pants pocket for months. I do prefer Noodler's inks and they work
very well in these pens. If I were to give one small suggestion to Pilot about
the colors of the plastic clips, the difference between black, blue-black, and
blue is pretty subtle; it would be nice if they were more-distinguishable. Such
a minor point for such a fine pen at a very reasonable price!"
Near Zero,"September 8, 2017","This little guy is amazing!  I left it alone for months and it still writes
well.  If you need a compact fountain pen, look no further.  You will need to
use a syringe to refill it or buy the expensive refills."
billynickey,"February 15, 2022","Very cute, and a pleasing form when capped. But it is just too small. By just a
bit, but enough. Much too small to write comfortably with unposted, and the
pressure from the web of my hand can cause the cap to shift slightly while
writing posted. Which results in a skip. I'm relatively tall with relatively
large hands for reference. The JetPens hand model definitely has Petit hands by
comparison. I would <b> the Petit here to press the joke, but alas, I have no
style. The F nib is a bit scratchy for a left handed person as well, though swapping
out the included cartridge for some Noodler's black helped a bit. The ink swap
also helped with the typical lefty ink smudging. When eyedropper converting, the wide shallow threads don't hold silicone grease
well, so you might need to go heavier with the grease to ensure a good seal. I
got some Surprise! capillary action on my first attempt. Inky fingers is just
one of the gifts of fountain pens.In all, nib feedback was a bit much for a nib that isn't super fine, though
lefties are a bit crippled with fountain pens regardless. I will be keeping the
Petit however, because it is adorable. "
Ladybugsey,"October 18, 2013","This is a very good pen, I love it. The ink is smooth and consistent. Although
one cartridge will only lasts you for so long. I suggest buying the refills as
well."
Anonymous,"December 2, 2022","Not the smoothest pen in the world, but it's unbelievably good for the price!I would have liked some more choices for the color of the pen (like clear), the
cartridges are super proprietary (most Pilot pens use cartridges proprietary to
the brand, but these are proprietary to this specific pen), and there's no
converter option. But those are nitpicks, it's hard to complain about such a
cheap fountain pen!"

butterchezmc,"November 2, 2022","Im fairly new to fountain pens and this was a great start to my collection! Only
thing is that I didn't realize fountain pens use a certain type of ink that is
thinner than typical dip pen ink....so now mine gets clogged each time I try to
use it "
Preston Halcomb,"October 26, 2022","This pen is an excellent writer for both the money and for the size. The nib is
exceptionally smooth as I often find Pilot nibs to be, and even the fine leaves
a nice line, with reverse writing capability. I'll definitely be recommending
these to my friends who are also into fountain pens."

charlieemory,"September 20, 2022","This little pen is absolutely lovely. Definitely look at photos and reviews
before buying it, as it's very small so it may not suit larger hands, and be
sure to remove the little yellow tab to get the ink flowing! It writes well and
is a nice, portable, beginner-friendly fountain pen. "
andrew.feldman191,"August 30, 2022","Having a few ""disposable"" fountain pens in the art box seemed like a good idea,

dontbuycheapshoes,"August 19, 2022","I rediscovered this little pen for sketching.  I got a Kaweco EF Sport and was
disappointed with the scratchiness of the nib.  (The first Sport pen was fine.)
But, I can get an EF by using the flip side of the nib.  I am so happy I
remembered I had this little gem."
paulinecl64,"July 20, 2022","I wish I started out my fountain pen collection with this little pen! It is the
perfect starter fountain pen. (And the cutest!)It comes with a little cartridge that is easy to install thanks to the little
diagrams that come with the pen. It's also very lightweight and easy to carry
along. I also like being able to see the ink flow down from the reservoir,
through the feed, and into the nib, so I really like the grip section of this
pen for that reason. It writes well, too, with a smooth flow of ink and a nib
that glides along cheap copy paper with ease!I guess the only ""downside"" would be that I would have to get Petit proprietary
cartridges to refill this, but I ended up getting the eyedropper conversion kit
available on this site in case I wanted to go that route. I'd prefer to use a
converter, but I haven't had any luck with converters for this pen (for obvious
reasons), so I may play around with washing and reusing a Petit cartridge by
filling one with my favorite ink. Other than that, I love this pen, and I'm
certain to buy more of these little guys as stocking stuffers for friends and
family in the future!"
joe.haney,"July 12, 2022",Great little pen. Grab it habitually already and you can’t beat the price. 
jaceti,"April 26, 2022","What a phenomenal pen - for the money it can't be beat.  For compactness it is
in its own class.  For reliability - it surpasses even Pilot's more expensive
pens and puts the competition in the rearview mirror. "
dreed,"April 16, 2022","I don't have a lot of fountain pens (this is my first one), so I don't have a

is miniature, but when you put the cap on it's back it doesn't feel that way.
And I love fountain pens!"
Sarah S,"February 11, 2022","These are so cute. Also, fantastic writers. You definitely need to use it posted

temporalstew,"October 30, 2021","At 3 dollars, I always marvel at this pen. It's plastic, and I'm sure made as
cheaply as possible, but it doesn't feel that way. The plastic feels so
solid--almost bizarrely so for the price point; it feels like I might have this
pen forever--and the nib is a shockingly good writer. I have had this inked up
with a Pilot cartridge since February and it still writes like a dream--super
wet nib, and not at all affected by long intervals without use. The feel of the
nib isn't amazing (you can definitely tell it isn't super polished), but it
still performs better than some much more expensive pens I own."

watch your ink flow into the nib! Writes well, if a bit chunky. (Can we please
get some slim fountain pens? Please??)Default ink is okay. Very black, but has a bit more feather than even Lamy ink
even on smooth paper (not-Tomoe-River-but-trying-really-hard-to-be)."

dip your toes in the water. Nice, sleek design, too."
kagamicchi,"January 10, 2021","Love this tiny pen! It looks really cool and writes very well. The only problem

smaller shirt pockets such as on Polo shirts. I don't really recommend it as a
pants pocket pen, but only because it is a fountain pen. This is a great introduction to the world of fountain pens. The only downside is
that the refills don't last very long but that can be overcome by using bottled
ink. "

for the price, I don't worry about loosing it too much. I will definitely get
some more so I can have different color inks ready to go. "

about losing, or first  pen for those who want to try a fountain pen.NOTE:  The ""Fine"" nib is great for those who write on copy or regular notebook
paper.  Porous papers like these suck up ink and turn a medium nib into a broad
nib.  The fine nib leaves just enough ink and dries fast.  This is true for most
Japanese nibs.  European nibs are broader than their Japanese counterparts, i.e.
a Euro fine is almost equivalent to a Japanese medium while a Euro extra fine is
almost equivalent to a Japanese fine."

would prefer the regular size. "

swalker040,"August 30, 2016",Great for eyedropper conversions. 
Lawrence,"August 20, 2016","It's a very nice pen for the price.I like to carry this and a few spare cartridges because I'm an overly prepared
person, haha.The point isn't as fine as some others I've used that say ""fine"", but that's
alright.The cap, when posted, makes this pen a comfortable size in my hand."
robotshenanigans,"August 13, 2016",smaller than I thought but still good
friendly artist,"August 11, 2016","I use this for both writing and sketching– it's smooth-writing and legible on
super-cheap composition book paper, and yet its line is wet and consistent
enough for things like crosshatching on sketchbook paper. I'm using this instead
of a fineliner to do black-and-white detail pieces from now on– it's just so
much more pleasant to use."
jebug29,"August 3, 2016","Very nice fountain pen, and I like the small size. It's so cheap it's basically
disposable! Both the ink and the nib are very nice.The only issue I have with the pen is that the included ink feathers and bleeds
pretty badly on filler paper. I would definitely recommend Noodler's Bulletproof
Black if that's an issue."
levi4780,"May 23, 2016",wish they had extra fine nibs. but its a great mini fountain pen for the price.
neeman,"May 22, 2016","Great pen with a great positive posting with a simple but sweet nibBUTit leaks when it is a eyedropper, in several models I triedthe cartridge is too small for real usage and to fiddly to keep refilling itGo to the Platinum Preppy"

bratchny,"April 10, 2016","A perfect fountain pen! Convenient size, comes in a fun array of colours, and to
my experience, has never stopped ink flow. "
glennhkc,"April 10, 2016","Best bang for the buck in fountain pens.  Pilot makes some of the best pens at
any price.  What they lack in visual appeal they far more than make up in
writing performance.  "
flambiase,"April 5, 2016","I bought this to fit in a pen loop affixed to an A5 journal, and found it
perfect for the cause. Capped, it's small enough to fit into a shallow pocket,
while the cap on the back end provides enough length to feel like a full sized
pen while writing. This writes well, too, especially for the price - ink has
been flowing smoothly without smudging or ghosting."
morefunthanwork,"March 30, 2016","What a fun little pen! After letting it stand with the nib down for about 5
minutes, this pen immediately started writing. No tuning needed. Not bad for a
pen at this price. I would not call this a ""fine line"", but closer to a medium
and it writes wetter than I expected, but that's ok because I can write fairly
fast and this keeps up nicely. It's a smooth, mono line writer. The size makes
it an easy EDC. I'd like to get the whole color line now. I do plan on turning
this into an eye dropper eventually. Maybe. I like it as is. I'd recommend this
as a first fountain pen. "
JFri,"March 25, 2016","Excellent, would rebuy.  Not scratchy, good line"
melissa,"March 25, 2016","Great pen for a great price! I love this thing, it rivals my more expensive
Kaweco sport! "
nsvinicki07,"March 21, 2016","I was very mistaken when I bought this pen. I'm absolutely in love with my
Platinum Preppy fountain pens, so I thought they would be of similar quality.
This pen feels a lot cheaper and does not write as smoothly as my preppys do.
The nib itself doesn't feel like I'm writing with metal, it feels like I'm
running plastic across the paper. The size is great and I love how portable it
is, I'm just really disappointed with the quality. "
Bobert McTobert,"March 19, 2016","Extremely smooth writing, and not uncomfortable at all to hold"
olivia131313,"March 15, 2016","Really lovely pen, comfortable to hold and writes really smoothly. The line is a
bit thick for my taste so I think I would go with extra fine in the future.
Super cute to look at and a nice streamlined design. Works best on good paper,
ink can get a bit spidery on cheep stuff. "
DragonD_evolution,"March 1, 2016","This is such a small pen. For this one you are going to have to post it. In less
you have very small hands. The writing is smooth and eforthless."
adpkjv,"February 18, 2016","Once again, Pilot rules! Beautiful, and dependable, and they can fit 2 or 3, at
a time, in that little pocket in your blue-jeans. Makes for a great
eye-dropper/tank pen too. Like all of the other Pilot products unprecedented
value. I highly recommend all of Pilot's products."
xenscooter,"February 17, 2016","Very nice bit of kit for the price.  Not quite as smooth as his big brother the
Metropolitain, but it will do, especially on the cheap paper you're likely to
encounter out and about, on which the stock ink dries instantly.  I'd gotten
this contemplating making a dropper pen, but no need; I've already snagged two
tubes of refills, as I intend on using this a lot.  Maximum bang for your
greenback dollar!"
rando nomad,"February 1, 2016","Great beginner fountain pen/low fuss pen. I've never had a fountain pen before

pemvee,"January 26, 2016","Perfect to carry discreetly with my small sketchbook.  Shorter than I'm used to
but the convenience can't be beat."
jimskcc,"January 26, 2016","I like this pen so much that I ordered a bunch more. I'll be adding even more in
the future, especially in different colors. The F nib is perfect for my needs
and the range of paper stock that I use. I like my lines thin and slightly wet.
This pen starts easily every time and lays down a consistent flow of ink. It's
not smooth, but the feedback is pleasant, not scratchy. Excellent at any price.
Beautifully engineered. Highly recommended. Suggestion for improvement: (1) Make
the inner lining of the cap removable for easy cleaning when ink gets caught
between the cap and liner. (2) Tighten and lengthen the threads between barrel
and section for ED compatibility. "
brewerdacia,"January 24, 2016","This is a fun little pen. The nib is not flexible at all though. So if you are
looking for something for calligraphy, this isn't really it. Still a fun pen,
but not what I was looking for."
sueiaus,"January 22, 2016","Love these pens, I have another one I bought from you in the past and I wanted
this one to write in my journal with in pink ink(which I had previously
purchased from you). Love how it writes.  Very smooth and has a great touch..."
jamie.dayao,"January 18, 2016","Perfectly petite. I purchased with extra ink cartridges. I never would have
thought to use a fountain pen as an everyday carry, but these are so portable.
It's a comfortable size for writing when the cap is attached. Durable fine nib
fountain tip."
Hugo Costa,"January 8, 2016",Very smooth while writting and the color is very rich

rjlebrane,"September 12, 2015","A sweetheart of a pen! Firm but responsive nib and smooth feed. Just the right
size for my hand with the cap posted, and I love the snap of the cap when
replacing, ensuring leak proof carry. Now my favorite pocket pen and part of my
sketch kit."
Oxen Von Knight ,"September 9, 2015","Nice pen.  uses the same nibs as a varsity. Though this is marked as a fine nib
I can not tell the difference between this and the medium in the varsity I have.
 It will be difficult to use this pen unposted due to it's short length.   "
ladilynn,"August 29, 2015","Love this little fountain pen. My first one. It writes like a dream, fits my
hand perfectly and such a great deal for pen and refills. Glad Pilot made these,
great way to dip your toes into the world of fountain pens."
LadyGrey,"August 8, 2015","Great little pen - I actually bought a few of these so that I can test some
sample inks. The compact size means I can use smaller amounts of the sample
inks, and the clear casing allows me to see when the ink runs low. These are
also a good way to introduce fountain pens to new people without having to spend
a lot of money on a standard pen. "
agentgrey86,"June 23, 2015","Saw the video and read reviews, and finally had to get one. I bought three in
order to test out ink-samplers, and these are an excellent buy! Despite my large
hand, the Petit 1 is remarkably comfortable. The cap even has holes in it so
removing doesn't create a vacuum and force ink out. For the causal writer, or
for someone who needs a reliable pen in every coat, jacket or desk drawer, this
is definitely the pen to have! "
pengirl,"April 6, 2015",I love these pens! They write beautifully and the size is so cute!
behjal,"March 30, 2015","Very smooth writer, love it."
cyclebug13,"March 29, 2015","very small when closed.  rugged, economical and a good feel. Scoop neck
cartridge system lends itself to refilling it quite easily with your own bottled

natiwood1,"March 13, 2015","The pen works really well, I use it for inking artwork and the lines are really
nice."
greenvonder,"March 3, 2015","Love it for writing! It is my first time using it since last time I picked a
fountain pen was in middle school (it was LONG AGO)! I adore it for sleek and
smooth feeling while writing. However, I purchased it on a purpose of using it
as my sketching pen. It saddened me to say that it is not exactly best choice
for quick sketching. The ink blotched and bled greatly while sketching. I gave
this product a three stars for its excellent beginner writing tool, not as a
cheap and effective sketching pen for any artists generally.If you aimed for a cheap and effective fountain pen for writing, then you will
not regret for buying it!"
terarla1,"February 26, 2015","This pen writes really nice.  I converted it so I could use my choice of black
permanent ink instead of cartridges."
lastknightjg,"February 25, 2015","Incredibly smooth writer, but even with copious amounts of silicone there's some
minor leakage around the threads once it's been converted into an eyedropper. It
really needs to be stored upright at all times, which precludes the ease of
carriage."
chill kid,"January 27, 2015","This was my first fountain pen and I must say, I will be trying more fountain
pens because this one was great. Feels very smooth, ink is pretty black. I just
used some cheap notebook and didn't have any problems with bleeding or
feathering. My only regret is not buying refills."
sketcher,"January 23, 2015","Great compact pen for sketching especially after an eye dropper conversion.
Smooth and ""wet"" for a fine point. Would be amazing with a medium nib."
marinacollings,"December 13, 2014","writes very cool, love the feel, it is a little bit chubby for my taste in pens
usually, but I kind of like it.the nib is a bit thick to be a fine."
slade,"December 8, 2014","This is probably the best ""mini"" fountain pen I have used yet. It writes so much
smoother than other fine tip nibs. Nice and small for taking down a quick note,
and when you put the cap on it is a full size pen.My only gripe is that I can't use a converter with this pen. I would also like a
clip-less version, but I am being a pit picky. Still this pen has become a daily
carry for me."
sterli27,"December 2, 2014","This is a really great pen. It is small enough to fit comfortably in my shirt
pocket but when you post the cap it becomes a normal sized pen. I have pretty
large hands and I can almost use the pen unposted, which I do when I need to
cross something off a to do list or something simple like that. Once it is
posted, the pen feels like a normal sized pen and is pretty comfortable to write
with. That being said, it is a plastic barrel pen so don't expect it to feel
like spectacular. The colors on these pens (I have the red, black, and light blue) are amazing.
Very vibrant. I ordered the fine nib and am pretty happy with it. Depending on
the paper, the ink line tends to vary widely in line size. They work great in a
Field Notes, but somewhat more like a medium or a broad on standard printer
style paper. These pens are refillable and come with a cartridge. You could
probably fill the cartridges back up with a syringe if you wanted but a three
pack of cartridges only costs about $2. That said, the ink on these pens will
probably run out quickly due to the small size of the cartridge. For the cheap price of these pens it is hard to pass up. I might buy several
more of this so that I can give them out to other people who want to try
fountain pens."
Penumbra,"November 8, 2014","It's nice to have the sort dead-reliable feed, comfortable grip, and competent
nib of a Pilot Varsity, with the convenience of cartridges. If the body were a
tad longer, to accept standard Pilot cartridges and converters, and a medium nib
like the Varsity's offered, it would be even more to my liking. I squeezed my
first cartridge too hard, trying to speed up the feed saturation, and cracked
it. My fault. In normal use, the cartridges are fine, and come in a great
storage/travel container. It's a lovely, cleanly designed little pen, elegant in
the true sense. I like the positive ""click"" on posting,  the airtight inner cap,
and the plastic that's clear but tough, and unlikely to crack.  This little
fellow is made to be used. One little thing.. my natural grip is right where the
body meets the section; and there's a sharp little angle there that I found a
bit uncomfortable. I unscrewed the body and, with an emery board, beveled the
sharp edge just enough to soften it to a comfortable angle.  It's now a  very
comfortable grip, suitable for long term writing.   "
chris.chan,"October 29, 2014",Nice little pen but if you don't keep the nib down the ink will not flow evenly
melimoha,"October 20, 2014","Absolutely love it! Already have a couple other friends that are getting one as
well - as Christmas gifts. Highly recommend :)"
Michael,"August 24, 2014","I really am very pleasantly surprised at how well this pen writes. Don't be
fooled by the cheap-looking plastic, the inexpensive price, and the ""mini"" form
factor.  This is a very smooth writer. Japanese F nib but not scratchy at all
for me. I tried it on a hardbound Blueline notebook of unknown paper weight
(probably about 60g), and also on a sheet of 100g stationery. Minimal bleed
through in the notebook, none on the stationery. Oh, and I bought this pen over a year ago - it was used for awhile and then put
away for several months. I picked it up again and began trying to write with it,
expecting the ink to be dried up. It began writing immediately with no skipping
or slow ink flow. The form factor is a little chunky and fat, so it can be fatiguing for me to
write with it for long periods, but it is perfect for short notes and cards. The
length is good with the cap posted. This is an excellent inexpensive pocket fountain pen. Would be perfect for a
child's first fountain pen as well. Recommended."
jghlee89,"April 4, 2014","Purchased this as my first trial fountain pen, a trial of some sort. I find that
fountain pens aren't too great unless I'm sitting down and committing myself to
writing. The portability is nice, but I found this pen to be inconvenient to
writing things down on the go."

babyscarletknight07,"November 18, 2022","I just started buying bold tipped nibs (this is my second/third one ever) and

inks. "
artistsdesk,"January 4, 2023","I’m so happy to have found the TWSBI Eco glow. The broad nib make for a smooth
write and the glow in the dark feature is so quirky. The heftiness of this pens
is a tremendous help to me since I have severe neuropathy in both hands. The
extra width gives me more control without my hand cramping up. I would highly
recommend this pen to people who need more in a pen to help them write or draw.
The pen’s piston makes it easier to fill with ink, no tiny converter. It
really makes a stark difference. Thanks Jet pens for your fast and thorough
service. "

cheap. Definitely buying again!"

jessy.klain,"June 17, 2018","You can't go wrong with a bundle. :) I love these pens. Blue handle is more of a
strong fine point with more control, it makes hand lettering in small print a
lot easier.Light gray is more of a fine size with a strong control while the dark gray has
a medium flexible felt tip.The bold nib gave my hand lettering a more modern & sassy style. At first it
wasn't my favorite to use, it took some time for me to gain control over the
flexibility of the nib. I now reach for the medium tip.I have had this bundle for a couple of weeks. The ink is a nice dark black, &
best of all, they're water-proof. Not once did they run when writing on top of a
water color design.Beginners of hand lettering may enjoy this bundle. Just remember that felt tip
pens can lose their shape when writing on a rough surface/paper."

RyanTCook,"February 7, 2022","I had tried these disposable brush pens before individually, and found it very
convenient to get the sampler bundle and cover all my bases. While it's no
secret that I use the finer tip more often than the others, it's great having
all the options on hand in case I need bolder lines for more impact. I've done a
lot of inking with expensive sable-haired brushes and I've found that I get
better results from cheap disposable brush pens. Maybe it's a mental thing where
I'm more willing to beat these things up and draw my heart out than I am with an
expensive brush. Either way, these things are the bomb!"

what type of brush pens I was comfortable with. "
viistar,"November 29, 2018","I really loved the variety of sizes and the more firm tips on these brush pens. 
They give you more control over the line than more flexible ones, and the
smallest one is very good for detailing and larger for controlled broad strokes.
 If that's what you're looking for, these are perfect."
annabelle6090,"October 8, 2018","Love these for practicing my brush lettering. Super great for use on regular
paper because I don’t have to worry about ruining the tip of a more expensive
pen, but the work it does still looks great!"
joel,"October 4, 2018",Excellent brush pens - very very happy with these.

ink is dark and the pen tips are flexible."

brianmattcraig,"May 2, 2022",Beautiful maki e pen and is a great everyday writer. 
smooth nib true M,"March 9, 2015","I dithered a while before buying this pen: Medium, or Fine? I've owned quite a
few Pilot pens, and they have ALL, without exception, run about a grade finer
than their American or European counterparts. I like a F nib, so with Pilot I've
always been happiest with a medium; this has been true most recently with a
Pilot Metropolitan and a Pilot Kaküno. I have mediums in both, and they are
like a Kaweco or Conklin or Franklin-Christoph or Edison F.However, I have to agree with the review I read someplace that the Elite 95S (or
its US-packaged version, the E-95S) does not seem to run finer. I ordered a M,
wanting a fine line, and I got a Medium line. So keep this in mind if you're
looking at this pen. This is no knock on the pen, but know what you're getting.
Why this is, I can't say.But that M line is very smooth; flow is probably a tick to the wet side, maybe a
6 or 7; it easily keeps up with any writing speed without being sloppy wet. This
is also a small and very lightweight pen. It's plenty long enough even for my
meathooks (I wear an 8-1/2 or XL surgical glove, if that helps) and fits
comfortably in the hand length-wise. But it's pretty slender, and so lightweight
that it feels insubstantial. I'd prefer just a bit more heft.None of these things reflect poorly on the pen per se. If you have a smaller
hand and like a light pen, and know what you're getting nib-wise, then you will
like it a lot. I like it too, and I'm getting used to these things. But if I'd
not inked it, I'd have returned it for the F of my dreams."
ElviStylo,"February 8, 2017","This is my favorite pen in the world. Ok: I like Pilot pens; I have never spent more than $370 on a pen; I don't go to
pen shows to fondle Grail pens.This pen is SO cool. It wears small, posts big. It is light.It is beautiful. The <M> nib is the smoothest nib I have used.I have an <F> which is also excellent. It is a somewhat amazing pen to use: its feel is surprising, the way the parts
fit together-wow.I have four of them, and two of its precursor pocket pens by Pilot.Some may be put off by the limited ink capacity, but not me.This is my favorite pen. In the World."
ADR in NY,"January 6, 2019","I am now in my 10th month of using this pen. Performance remains optimum. I
still hold the position of all the points made in my March 2017 review. However,
I must add this: KEEP THIS PEN FROM COMING INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER HARD
MATERIALS. The finish on the cap of my pen has been lightly scratched. This is
because I kept it in cases, along with other pens, that did not have individual
pen sections. THIS WAS A MISTAKE. While I'm never abusive towards any of my
pens, especially the more expensive ones, and believed I was always careful with
them, it wasn't enough to keep this one in pristine condition. I'm happy to
report that the scratches are not such that one could, at first glance, notice
them, but they are there. Would hate this to happy to others. My advice... KEEP
THIS PEN IN ITS OWN SLEEVE."
makey95,"September 23, 2014","I bought this pen for my girlfriend, and it was even more elegant in person. The
nib is wonderfully smooth, but not the smoothest EVER (that needn't be a bad
thing. There was a touch of feedback, which is desirable to feel the paper and
to keep one's handwriting neat). I had excellent service with Jetpens and I
would buy this again, perhaps one for myself in the future!"
mrichards0321,"September 14, 2022","I love this pen. It look SO good, feels good in the hand and writes smoothly.
Out of all my fountain pens I only have three inked at a given time. This pen is
definitely in my rotation at all times."
gk.rhine,"March 6, 2020","Love it! Only thing is the nib-I ordered the medium and it was a little heavier
than I expected. However he did write beautifully"
una.chung,"May 9, 2019","This is a classy pen. The retro design both looks and feels sophisticated
without trying too hard. I like the combination of materials in the smooth resin
body and satiny metallic cap. The red-brown color is beautiful. The pen writes
superbly. The M nib on this pen is much wider than on many other Japanese pens,
which are often finer than a Western EF. This medium writes somewhere between a
Western F and M."
ADR in NY,"March 27, 2018","This is my first gold nib and what a nib it is! It performs absolutely
beautifully, writes extremely smooth. It's a lightweight pen, weighing in at
about 17 grams/0.6 ounces. The inlay nib and the wine/gold body color adds to
the pen's elegance. The cap slides off smoothly and posts securely. Posting the
cap adds the perfect amount of length, at 5.8 inches, which I'm quite happy
about as I prefer my caps posted while writing. I'm also able to write with it
comfortably without the cap which testifies to how small my hands are.
Personally, I could have done without the gold plated ""Elite"" name; in my
opinion, it cheapens the look. I would have preferred the name be placed on the
back of the cap where the words ""Pilot Japan"" are located. I love my new pen and
highly recommend it."
tamaGo Away,"March 21, 2018","This pen was my first gold nib and I was originally unaware of it. I feel like
it doesn't really get much love in the FPN community? I don't see why though
because it's a solid writing instrument.I've had it in my daily carry since October 2017. The only cons I've noticed are
that it kind of tends to be dry on the upstrokes for a few writing sessions
after flushing and re-inking. I also made the mistake of carrying it in a
zippered pouch with a drafting pencil with a knurled grip and that definitely
left some ugly scratches on the gold metal cap. Don't do that...Aesthetically, the look is so classic vintage: the gold and the rich burgundy
really complement each other and the design is a retro reproduction too. The
inlaid nib is gorgeous and the springiest among all my gold nibbed pens. It just
screams class.Overall, this is a superb pen with what is in my opinion a timeless design."

praises, I was on the fence because I'm very particular for pens (as I guess
everyone on this website is), but wow. It's as fine as Hi-Tec but with better
ink flow and a better grip. I won't be giving up on my Pilots, but I'm
definitely purchasing refills and other colors of the Signo."

for my handwriting style, and one of the only gel pens I've ever found that I
actually enjoy writing with for long periods of time! Even for a 0.38mm the flow
is consistent and produces a very nice line in terms of width. I love these pens
and I'm hooked for life. My only note is the Blue is not very dark (like a Pilot G2 gel, or Monteverde
Soft Roll), its more of a light blue which can get lost on printed documents.
The blue-black is my favorite for this reason. "

karl,"August 23, 2017","I really like this pen.  The ink flows great - even and smooth (I use it
primarily with Moleskine Cahier notebooks), and it is very quick drying and
extremely smudge resistant after a few seconds.  The one complaint I do have is
that because it is such a small point, and I assume the metal around the ball is
fairly thin, I have a tendency to wear the tip out before I use all of the ink
in the refill."

parsimonious 151s."
Calebshelburne,"November 9, 2015","I really love these pens from a writing perspective, but the construction of the

lhanneman,"July 6, 2015","Excellent pen for those who like a fine line, but not too fine. Has much more
ink capacity than Uni-ball Signo pens available in your ordinary office supply
shop. Similar tip though. The grip is useful but not cushiony. The main difference for me between the Signo and the Hi-Tec C is the tip of the
pen. The Hi-Tec has a needle point with some give to it, so if you are prone to
writing hard, the Signo might be better. I have not had any ink flow problems
with this pen (I had some issues with the Hi-Tec C due to keeping it in the
wrong position in my pencil bag). If you have a heavy hand and like less give on the pen tip, the Signo might be
the best choice for you. I haven't really found a difference in ink quality
between Signo and Hi-Tec C, but I haven't dumped any water on my writing for a
while. "

tip."
Tuco,"November 11, 2020","I got this pen directly from Japan before JetPens stocked it.  The Zoom
rollerball refills it uses are among some of the best I've tried for permanence
and being left-hand friendly.  Many rollerball pens use water-soluble ink that
would get washed out in contact with water--not good for signing contracts or
legal documents.The Hairline Black is my favorite of the 505 META line for having a matte,
thinly-brushed finish and the full black profile that adds stealth and
discretion.  It is not too heavy for a left-hander who writes by pushing towards
the paper, and the rubber grip is a practical feature to aid with writing
fatigue.  The cap is also strong and secure.I had to dock a star because over time, the finish will begin to peel off in
certain areas, and where this happens will depend on the user.  In my case, the
thin ring that comes into contact with the cap will show some brassing.  The
protruding, curved edge of the rubber grip towards the rollerball tip and
protrusion around the base of conical tip will also show some brassing as the
pen is repeatedly capped and uncapped.  If you drop it on the side walk, be
prepared for that event to leave its mark on the pen.  I still think it's a
great EDC pen to have in your pocket nonetheless."
Coda320,"August 8, 2021","Incredible pen. Strong line for a .5mm. Very consistent & reliable inkflow, and
great feel from the rollerball nib. I've only used it on quality paper but I'm
sure it will serve well on cheaper notebook paper as well. A bit on the heavier
side but very well balanced, so you don't feel it when writing. And as with all
Tombow products, I love its beautiful, sleek, understated design and top quality
materials. I look forward to using this pen for years to come. "
wes.beltz,"April 8, 2021","This is a very sharp looking pen. It feels sturdy and has a nice weight to it,

mceciliamurphy,"February 5, 2020","This is a really nice pen. The weight is just right, and it looks very nice. The

This is disappointing! "
etherdonkey,"November 12, 2011","While the ink consistency and smoothness is better than the average ballpoint,
it doesn't surpass the Jetstream. In my personal opinion, it writes about like a

Not bad though for the cost."
Metasyntax,"January 19, 2018","The best 0.5mm ballpoint pen I have. Super smooth, always starts up right away,
never skips or globs. What's funny is that it's smoother and more consistent
than the 0.7mm Acroball. I rank this higher than the Jetstream and Surari pens
in 0.5mm tips; those options are fine, but the Acroball is just better at this
size. Makes me want to try the colored ones."
bam.mead,"December 7, 2022",Feels scratchy and it skips a bit

clairifyit,"September 15, 2022","The Acroball  Ballpoint is a favorite pen as it is easy to write with on various

with a clear upper body."

then look no further. It also seems a hair finer than most 0.5 points. "

arieswriting,"June 9, 2017","I really love this pen. The grip area is very comfortable, and I find the ink to
be really well behaved. I wish it came in a 0.38 or 0.3mm since I find the 0.5 a
little wide for my tastes, but I don't mind due to the comfort of using this
pen. I think my grip style makes it hard to find a comfortable pen, so this was
a welcome find."

yyang0711,"July 31, 2013","It writes very well, although it becomes a little scratchy when I try to write
quickly. The ink flows out nicely and does not form that awkward blob at the end
when I make a long line. The ink is very dark but it does take a few seconds to
dry--if you're left-handed, beware! "
Lapicerista,"April 28, 2013","Very glossy ink, comparable to a ballpoint but flows on the paper as a gel ink
pen. "
klbremer,"July 5, 2011","A smooth writing experience--delightful to write with. It makes a thin line,
does not glop at all, does not cut out.  Writes very well on high quality paper
like the Kokuyo Campus Line options or the Kokuyo Campus MIO, AND also writes
well on regular American papers.  A wonderful writing experience along the lines
of the Uni-ball Jetstream series.  I'd love to see the Pilot Acroball come out
with a colored line such as the Jetstream. "
carlos,"September 21, 2015","This is my third TWSBI fountain pen. I have the 580 Diamond, the Mini and this
one, all in EF nib. All write equally well using Pilot Ama-Iro Iroshizuku ink.
My Mini experienced a small ink leak that was corrected with the application of
the included silicone grease (don't ever throw out the pen box!). The ECO model
has a smooth barrel vs the faceted one of the Diamond. The pen cap screws on the
front but clicks on the back when it is posted. This is very nice for those with
OCD who like to have the pen clip line up with the top of the nib (like me). The
balance of the ECO pen when posted is much better than the 580 Diamond (too
heavy) or the Mini (lighter, but the clip never lines up with the nib). If you
want a great pen at a great price the TWSBI ECO Fountain Pen is the one you want
to order!"
bailey.drummer,"April 12, 2017","Very happy with this pen, it's my first fountain pen but I love it. To keep in
mind with the sizing; it is a Taiwanese pen which seems to mean the nib is
closer to an EF in the german sizing than an EF in the Japanese. It seems to
have a slightly broader line than the fine in the pilot metropolitan. "
mizabecker,"November 28, 2015","The TWSBI ECO pens are the sturdiest feeling, best out-of-the-box writing and
all-around ""awe-worthy"" of any pen I've ever purchased. I bought the 1.1
""stubby"" point first (a great every day and calligraphy pen; you can read that
review if you're interested in something different); I was happy with it, but my
first love is always the EF point. The ECO did not disappoint. These pens barely
need to get wet before they are writing away with the smoothness of your well
broken in old favorite; they slip into your life like the proverbial pair of old
slippers. This one has never scratched, nor skipped, nor blotted; the EF line is
true to the .3-equivalent I've heard others give for the best of the EF points
around, and the width doesn't vary.  The pen fills easily, though not to its fullest capacity. No matter how
carefully I've worked the piston, it will only fill to about 4 cm from the
piston head - so there's a gap there between the ink & the top end of the pen
(as you hold it point-down). This is true for both my ECOs, and I guess nothing
to get upset about, as the ink doesn't gush out, nor is it slow to flow, either.
The pen feels sturdy, solid & 100% up to the job of writing on & on.  Again, JetPens, you've made me one happy writer! One just can't go wrong here! "
andy,"October 9, 2015","Love this pen. And it's one of the few times where it's actually and truly EXTRA
FINE."
lwells1053,"June 16, 2016","Fantastic pen for the price. Nib not as extra fine as on my more expensive pens,
but still a nice line. Ink flows first time even after not using for several
days, which is a big plus. I would definitely purchase again."
clpennz,"December 1, 2015","I love this pen. It writes smoothly and has no problems starting even after a
couple of days of non-use. The pen holds a large capacity of ink, so it is great
for doodling for long periods."
armada68,"November 9, 2018","Not my first ECO and hopefully not my last.  I have several in different colors.
 They are superb.  Writes smoothly all the time on any of the good (Rhodia,
Midori, etc.) journals.  Holds tons of ink.  Feels good in the hand.  I get
complements in meetings at work.  I use this one daily at work.  It is
bombproof.  Nib is stiff, but delivers a solid extra fine line, not too thin or
too thick.  Something between the Pilot super sharp and the Lamy.  Could not
recommend more highly."
hjools,"March 6, 2018","The TWSBI ECO is a fantastic starter pen. The ink capacity alone makes it a good
choice for students that need to take a lot of notes, and the EF nib on this
model means you can use cheaper papers without much fuss. I have the clear
demonstrator model as well as this black model, and in my opinion this black
model looks more well-made and understated. I am rather partial to Japanese F nibs, but the EF nib on this pen is a hair
wider than the F nib on my Pilot Prera. That, in combination with the ink
capacity and the relative robustness of the body of the pen in comparison to the
Prera, has made it a fine replacement for said Prera in my daily rotation. I have very small hands, but this pen (unposted) is just about the perfect
weight and length. Posted, it's a little too top-heavy for comfortable use. The
grip has an oddly sharp rim closer to the nib, where I normally grip my pens
(thanks to my small hands), but actually ended up correcting my pen grip. "
travieso.lee,"July 10, 2016","I am extremely happy w/ my ECO. I have been carrying and using it daily w/o any
complaints. The EF nib is smooth and does not drown the paper or bleed through."
cheflancome,"December 1, 2015","The pen is so awesome it got stolen in 2weeks. But I was able to fix my other
one the wrench got stolen to. Can't wait for someone to get mad the it exploded
all over them when they take it apart. "
Mr E,"February 6, 2019","LOVE this pen. I picked it up to get a larger ink well and have loved every
minute with it.It writes smoothly, fills easily, and is remarkably reliable. I am an avid note
taker and was refilling my other pens daily. With this pen, I only need to
refill about every four to five days.I've got fairly small hands and the size is a bit larger than I was initially
expecting, but after a couple days I came to actually enjoy that aspect.I'd highly recommend this as a workhorse pen."
Stan,"January 4, 2019","These are beautiful pens! No denying that. They seem to be well made. I was
concerned with the giant ink reservoir leaking, but have had no leaking issues
but I don’t carry this one. I just don’t like this pen with the EF nib maybe
it would be better in F. The EF nib is scratchy and the ink flow seems abit too
dry for the ink and paper combo that I use. For the money I would suggest a Lamy
Safai in an EF nib. The Lamy Safari is not as pretty as the ECO but the Safari
writes and draws on another level by comparison."
lucia,"March 21, 2018","I love the ink capacity of this pen, the fact that I can see my ink (both the
color and how much I have left), the twist off cap, the ease of cleaning, the
piston filling mechanism, and the extra fine nib. I don’t like how plasticky this pen feels. I have a Pilot Metropolitan with a
fine nib, and that pen was less than half the cost of this one, yet it has a
nice solid feel to it. I also happen to prefer very fine pens, and the Pilot
fine is a bit finer than the TWSBI extra fine. I am using Noodler’s Black in
both of them, and have also tested them with Massachussetts 54th. Very convenient for students who are always running around and don’t have time
to worry about if their pen has ink in it, but the pen is kinda chunky and
plasticky. Not that the plastic is crappy plastic - it’s very high quality
plastic, and feels quite durable - but I just don’t like it as much as the
nice metallic, solid feel of the PM."
planB,"November 13, 2016","This is a very nicely made pen, the materials look to be of good quality. Fit
and finish are what you would hope for a pen of this price. My example however
was horribly scratchy out of the box - paper tearing scratchy is more like it.
It was quite unusable and I should have just sent it back. Instead I went to
work on the nib and got it smooth and functional - at least in a sweet spot.
However along the way it showed a propensity for ink to blob along the feed -
worse with Noodlers Black ink, which flows like the unstoppable Amazon river
from this pen. Diamine Jet black ink is a little better, but getting the pen to
start is a trial sometimes. As it stands this is a desk pen for me. It is so
temperamental that I dare not put it in the sketch kit, or carry it for general
use. Those of you who got a smooth writing pen of this type with no other issues
are fortunate! Another thing I don't like is that replacement nibs are not
readily available, when they can be had for some other brands in this price
range."
mizu1,"January 6, 2016","At first, the TWSBI ECO extra fine seems to write a little dry for me. I thought
it would be equivalent to a Lamy Safari extra fine, but it seems to write a
little drier (finer lines). But that's just my opinion. So I used a micro mesh
to widen the space between the tines in the nib. After that, it wrote wetter,
and I'm very pleased with this pen. It is smooth and holds a lot of ink."
greyautumnsky,"March 9, 2020","Bought this ink to be a dedicated pen for Noodler's Standard Black ink, for
writing in my lab notebook. A little wider than I would like the nib to be, but
writes at about a F. However, I like to use very fine Japanese nibs at home. I'd
say this the EF is about the same width as a LAMY EF, or a Japanese F leaning
toward M."
ginarteau,"October 31, 2018","I love the smoothness of this pen and its easy filling option. The EF point is
not quite as fine as Platinum Preppy 02, though, which is a favorite. "
scott,"September 6, 2018","I love the TWSBI ECO pens.  I use one in the office and have a couple of others
that I use with my sketchbooks.  I have both Fine and Extra Fine and fine them
both easy to work with.  I love the fill mechanism and the fact that I can see
how much ink I have to work with so I can load up if I am headed out the door
and don't want to take extra ink with me. "
Eutychus,"January 4, 2018","What a splendid pen! It writes great right out of the box, holds a bunch of ink,
and feels well made. It may be the economical TWSBI pen, but I don't think it
feels cheap. I like the way it posts, although I have read comments that suggest
the o-rings that grip the pen might wear out. I chose the EF nib, a first for
me. I find it very well suited for writing in a small notebook, as well as on
paper that you don't want to lay down a very wet line. It does not lend itself
to expressive handwriting or showing off ink color. I definitely plan to
purchase other ECO pens to try out the other nib sizes. This is an excellent
value."
12345,"December 11, 2016","I love this pen, it writes beautifully and is a great price for a starter pen.

the nib for my sensibilities. Filling it is very simple and it holds a good

emptied it half way yet. I will be buying more in the future so I can have the

athar.rafiq,"August 12, 2022","The pen arrived and I had to use it immediately after waiting so long to afford
to buy it. Filled it with Movteverde USA Horizon Blue ink and the first writing
experience was sheer joy! I have been using fountain pens for most of my life
(over 6 decades) and for $35, I have never experienced such a pleasant, flowing,
smooth, gliding motion over the average notebook paper. As an assistant
professor, I cannot afford the expensive papers and pens but this has been a lot
of fun."
zip freeman,"July 6, 2022","This is from the perspective of someone who uses fountain pens for drawing with
watercolor washes. That means I use ink that holds up to washes, like Platinum
Carbon Black, De Atramentis Document, and blue-black iron gall inks. It seems
like this pen does not do well with water-resistant inks.I can't trust it to start. Much like a ballpoint pen, every time I use it, I
scribble on scrap paper to get it going. It skips on occasion, sometimes
multiple times in a row (very frustrating). According to JetPens support, I did
not get a dud pen. They tested it and it worked for them. I guess if you stick
to non-waterproof inks, it's much smoother. Anyway, it performs much worse than my Pilot Kakuno ($12) and Pilot Metropolitan
($20) with the same inks. I really wanted to like the Eco for the ink capacity,
since sometimes I end up refilling every couple days, but I got frustrated and
gave up on it before I could even empty it once.I bought another Eco with a Bold nib, which does better (Pilot makes no cheap
pens with Bold nibs, unfortunately), but still not as smooth as the Pilot pens
at half the price."
allethasaunders,"May 28, 2022","Straight forward, well made pen.  Butter smooth.   It has taken me a long time to love EF nibs,
but I appreciate that TWSBI has made that possible for me.  It is also wonderful
to not need to refill my ink every five minutes.  Definitely an EDC."
David Cesarino,"April 30, 2022","Excellent. There are a few things that I believe warrants mentioning, and I'll
compare to the Platinum Preppies, which are well known, good enough for the
price, cheap, thus providing good comparability.1) It is just a little bit broader than the old EF Platinum Preppy, and I mean
the EFs you could buy up to around 5 years ago, with the transparent back
barrel, not the newer EF pens with the colored back barrel.2) The TWISBI ECO writes smoother than the Preppy. This is very perceptible.3) It is very balanced when writing, both with and without the cap attached.4) It looks way, way better than it seems by looking at the pictures here on
JetPens. Especially after you fill with ink.Overall I'm very, very satisfied. This one is a keeper and I intend to use it
almost every day for a long, long time."
Shawn,"April 11, 2022","Amazing pen and a great introduction to the fountain pen hobby. The fill
mechanism is easy to use, its easy to clean and I like that I can use bottled

canisters. "
Pensformrn,"February 15, 2022","Pen works fantastically, I’ve had no issues writing at all and the large well

RJL03042014,"September 2, 2021","It's everything I expected it to be. It holds a surprising amount of ink, and
for an EF nib it writes very smoothly. I swapped to this from a kaweco sport, so
the full size in comparison is an adjustment but that's because I got used to a
small pen. "
belinda2edwards,"July 13, 2021","Superb pen. I love the extra-fine nib which writes smoothly. I would definitely
buy this product again. "
jiri.lebl,"June 1, 2021","Writes very nice, a little on the wet side.  Easy to fill, large capacity.  I am
a little paranoid about the piston getting unscrewed by mistake and squirting
ink, but so far has not happened.  When it is tight it can be actually pretty
tight and takes a bit of force to move it.  When posted I find it a little bit
top heavy and not totally comfortable, also the cap is not totally secure when
posted.  It does sort of snap on, but it's easy to knock it off anyway.  I just
use it unposted, and it is very comfortable to write unposted.Since it writes a little wet, so thicker than my other EFs, I use it for online
teaching with a document camera.  Downside is I put black ink (for the online
teaching) into it and so it isn't quite as fancy looking as would be with a
colorful ink sloshing around."

Cecropia,"March 15, 2020","To start off, the pen comes in a nice plastic case, with a wrench and little
bottle of grease. I'm a bit too new to fountain pens yet to feel comfortable
taking it apart to maintain it, but it's a nice touch. It has a nice big ink
reservoir with a built-in piston filling system, and I love having the clear
barrel to see my ink level. It feels nice and heavy (but not too heavy!) in the
hand, and writes well. It feels a bit scratchy on some papers, but it IS an
extra fine nib, and I have no trouble in my Bristol and rhodia notebooks. I use
it to draw, and it seems to have a bit of trouble keeping up the ink flow with
quick strokes, which seems to be the case with all fountain pens and is not
really an issue, but keep it in mind! Slowing down keeps the flow nice and
consistent, I've yet to have it skip otherwise. Definitely worth the price!"

is what I like and dislike.Likes: - Smooth writing pen, does not skip, fits good in my hand, does not
scratch.Dislikes: - I feel that line thickness has everything to do with paper.  I got a
Stalogy note book and it writes quite wonderfully if I hold it at a slight
angle, however if I use the cheep copy paper that my office uses it is bold and
bleeds (again I know this has to do with the paper, not the pen).Overall, I feel this is a good pen and I'm looking forward to getting another so
I can see if there is any difference in the vacuum fillers and the piston.  "

nwroper,"July 25, 2017","I have bought two of these pens. I Absolutely love this pen when it works. But
both have broke in the same exact way. The barrel right at the front next to the
nib cracks, usually in multiple locations and begins siphoning ink through the
near invisible cracks, making it impossible to use without getting ink on your
fingers. Both the pens cracked in under 5 months. With the first one I thought I
was unlucky, now I just think its pen not designed with longevity in mind, would
not buy a third."
haroharoharo,"July 17, 2017","In my opinion, this is quite a good pen. It has a good ink flow, and holds quite
a bit of ink. It also didn't leak, which is better than some of my other pens.
Sometimes, though, other people are playing with my pen and accidentally twist
the knob at the top and some of the ink comes out, but that is on them and is
not on the pen. The only problem that I have is that the extra fine is not
actually extra fine. I have a few Pilot Metropolitans in the fine nib, and those
fine nibs are thinner than the extra fine nib on the TWSBI ECO. Other than that,
though, this is a very good pen."

wjpzk,"May 27, 2017","Love these TWSBI pens,  Have one ECO in every nib size and they all write
wonderfully.  I have some pricier gold nib pens and these write just a well. 
Great value, great pen"
Carus,"April 20, 2017","The nib was a little scratchy in the beginning but after adjusting the nib it
wrote smoother. I like to pair this pen with my wetter inks so it doesn't give
as much feedback. I would buy one again but maybe a different nib."
Alex,"April 5, 2017","The pen leaves a little too much ink on the paper. I'd recommend using quick
drying ink."
Michael.Oestreich,"March 28, 2017","This pen writes very well for its low price.  Maintenance is simple is basic and
instructions were simple.  Changing inks, cleaning, and lubricating is also
easy.  For some reason it also catches other peoples eye when i use it at work
and creates an interesting conversation piece."
tausanchez,"February 17, 2017","Great writing pen, easily glides !!"
Dana,"November 26, 2015","I love this pen. Wrote smoothly right away, with a very fine line. Feels
comfortable in my hand with or without the cap posted."
rosenwald,"November 13, 2015","Writes like a gem -- has the writing characteristics of a pen 10 times the
price. The XF nib is wonderful."
dglongjr,"November 10, 2015",Great value!  I like the look of the pen as well as the full piston filler. 
Hugo Costa,"November 6, 2015","Just received 2.One is loaded with Pilot ina-ho iroshizuku and the other with J. Herdin - Ambre
de Birmanie.Great pen, extremely smooth even if it's a EF nib. Doesn't scratch the paper
even from the first strokes.Being a demonstrator's pen it also adds character."
NanB,"November 2, 2015","Excellent value. Not too wet or dry, the nib consistently lays down a uniform
line. I have it inked up with Diamine Ancient Copper, and it always writes
immediately. Highly recommended."
trish.frazier,"October 8, 2015","It's perfect and the price is great for a new fountain pen user.  I love writing
with it!!"
fiberdrunk,"October 2, 2015","This is my first TWSBI, and wow, what a great pen!  I use it for shorthand, with
the EF nib-- it's great for that!  I love the large ink capacity and the
built-in piston-fill ink converter.  I know this will not be my last TWSBI.  "
weglarz_m,"April 18, 2017","Love this pen.  The extra-fine nib is perfect for me.The pencil case is also great.  I researched both these items and they proved
true to the description."
jbstan7,"October 8, 2016","My first Twisbi is the Eco x-fine nib. Not extra fine! I purchased a Lamy x-fine
in the same order and that pen is truly extra fine! Ordering two pens with the
'same' size nib was because I had the Pilot Metropolitan Medium and that just
wasn't fine enough. This Twisbi and my Pilot are nearly the same. I like the
feel and smoothness of the way it writes, just so disappointed in how broad the
extra fine nib is!! Wish I could give this pen more stars--I am reluctant to
purchase and more in the Twisbi line-up with out some other customer
reviews/input. "
rolandaragona2,"October 23, 2015",Excellent ink. I use for all purposes. 
Pinataplans,"January 11, 2021","I wish I had not wasted the money or time on any other fountain pen. I have
purchased many other less expensive fountain pens over the years, mostly because
I couldn't bring myself to pay twice the amount for a TWSBI. ""What's the
difference?,"" I told myself. Well, a lot, actually. The piston-fill is EVERYTHING! I no longer have to deal
with low capacity converters or proprietary cartridges. And I can write so much
more before having to refill because the ink capacity is so much more generous
in a TWSBI.Also, in my experience with less expensive pens, there is usually a hard start
if I don't use the pen everyday, whereas the TWSBI is a smooth writer even if
it's been a week since I last picked it up."
chasesakounts,"November 27, 2020","Absolutely beautiful (a little bigger than expected, but I have tiny hands, so I
should be used to that by now) and a delightfully juicy inkflow. I write really
fast, and I've had 0 problems with skipping"
CovingtonLetterCo,"May 6, 2021","Gosh this baby writes like a dream!! I wish I had bought this pen as my first
fountain pen purchase. I can 100% see myself buying more of these. The M nib is
just write for my size writing. The barrel feels supremely comfortable in my
hand - specifically compared to the LAMY Safari, Pilot Metropolitan, and the
Kaweco Sport. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the visible ink well, but I
quite like it. I've been using it with Diamine's Dark Forest ink and it's just
gorgeous! Highly, highly recommend."
saraskids1,"July 23, 2020","This is my new favorite pen.  It holds a large supply of ink and writes
smoothly.  I have used it for art projects as well as general writing and find
it excellent for both."
katcole,"February 5, 2021","This is my third TWSBI Eco. I love that you can see the ink color and level
through the barrel. The pen is very easy to dissemble using the included tool,
so the pen is very easy to clean. Overall one of my favorite pens!"
abilorditch,"April 14, 2020","Writes very smoothly with no leaking, very easy to fill and shows off the ink
delightfully well. No skidding over paper."
flowersmoke,"March 27, 2020","A great pen, easy to use and comfortable to hold, love the color. I'd probably
call it seafoam green rather than mint blue, but that just might be due to the
lighting in my room casting a yellow tint on it, hah. It's nice either way."
mami.angeles1404,"February 19, 2020","This fountain pen writes so amazingly smooth! I love it so much I have ordered
another one!"
gabiappinelli,"July 30, 2022","Arrived so fast and carefully packaged!!! This is, by far, the best, affordable
fountain pen I have in my collection! Glides effortlessly and worked, flawlessly
from the moment it hit the paper!!"
KAlice,"June 17, 2022","I originally had a flow problem with this pen until TWSBI customer service sent
me a new nib. now it works perfectly!"
sierra.e.lomo,"June 10, 2022","One of my favorite pens that this purchase is my second TWSBI pen. The medium
nib allows the ink to showcase any shading effects, although it's a bit more
subtle on medium compared to broad. I find it does have trouble writing on
smoother papers, but in general, it's not an issue.I compared my TWSBI medium nib to my LAMY medium nib and I found that my TWSBI
medium is -slightly- larger than my LAMY.The piston feature is easy to use and secure. It stores so much ink that I don't
have to refill it often."
charmainemartinez,"April 29, 2022","I absolutely LOVE this pen. It holds so much more ink than cartridge style
fountain pens. Filling the pen with ink is super easy and mess-free. Flow of the
ink is even and it's a dream to write with this pen. I am currently using
Diamine Oxford Blue ink in this pen and I would describe this ink as pretty wet.
As a result, the line weight is thicker than it might be with an ink such as the
Pilot Namiki, which I am using in another fountain pen. The pen is somewhat
thicker in diameter than many pens, so if you like skinny pens, this may not be
the right style of pen for you. The point of the pen is tapered, so if you hold
it closer to the nib, it is a bit narrower. This pen is a amazing; if you're on
the fence, you should definitely buy it. It's my new favorite pen and I use if
for everything: writing in my planner, making lists, writing cards, etc. It just
gives me joy to write with this beauty."
Pentastic,"April 13, 2022","Overall I like the color of this pen a lot. The nib is on the drier side so I
have to be deliberate with which ink I use as a dry ink creates a horrible
writing experience. For me, I’m doing less writing these days as a new mom so
the large ink capacity is sometimes a negative as I like to change inks
frequently. Still it’s an affordable pen but for writing quality I prefer the
580 ALR."
amandajhare,"April 12, 2022","Liz Steel recommendation from her Sketching Now classes. I love this pen for
urban sketching and journaling. "
stephiepeterson,"April 11, 2022","This is a great pen.  Reasonably priced and writes nicely.  Fills easily, too. 
I like it so much, I want to get one in every color that comes out now (and so I
can fill it with lots of different colors and have lots of different colors to
write with, depending on my mood)."
erin.wildman,"November 13, 2021","One of my daily use pens. Lighter than it looks even when completely full. Would
absolutely recommend."
100 Friendly Bees,"September 25, 2021","this is my new favourite pen. it's a smooth writing experience with still enough
feedback to feel pleasant, and the ink flows so nice and wet! also the barrel
being a bit bigger than your average pen feels really good in the hand."
burnsmarshall2,"August 18, 2021","This pen is such a dream to use. The grip has a slight contour to it like a
rounded triangle that just makes holding a dream. The medium nib was a bit much
for me, but I switched it to a fine nib and it’s perfect for me. For the first
filling, just cycle the ink a couple times with the piston to fill the reservoir
up a bit fuller. "
landonrtipton06,"June 2, 2021",My favorite pen! So easy to use!
justanothermusician,"February 15, 2021","This pen has been lovely to write with so far.  I've only put about one round of
ink through it so far, but good flow, easy to fill, and the demonstrator aspect
of the TWSBIs is kind of fun."
kdeback3,"January 5, 2021",Really glad I have this in my collection. I have three pens with three inks now
svaden65,"March 30, 2020",My first fountain pen. Excited to use. Very happy with quality of product.
jon.sienkiewicz,"October 7, 2020","The Platinum Preppy is the best choice for a refillable, budget-priced fountain
pen. The 03 (Fine) and 02 (Extra Fine) write smoothly, without skip, and so far
(for me at least) they never fail to start writing I when start writing. Added
bonus -- with a O-ring and some silicone grease (both available from JetPens)
you can convert a Preppy into an eyedropper filler. It holds so much ink you
could probably rewrite War & Peace before running dry. Highly recommended. "
Francesca,"February 1, 2021","I was expecting this pen to be scratchy, being an extra-fine, but it’s not. It
has some feedback, HB pencil-like. The blue-black ink cartridge is not really
blue-black but is what I consider blue, unlike the Pilot Petit 1, which is
blue-black. I like the length of the Preppy and use it unposted. The nib and
feed come out easily for quick cleaning. I like that the supplied cartridge has
a metal ball. The ink flows well and I’ve had no hard starts nor skipping on
the papers I used (absorbent, less absorbent and coated) and no feathering; the
only problem I had was when using a paper with a waxy feel coating. The “Slip
and Seal” cap does prevent the nib from drying out, and the ink from
evaporating from the cartridge (unlike the Pilot Petit 1). I prefer my Preppy 03
because it offers a cushioned feel, but the 02 does lay down a thin, contained
line. Excellent value for money."
SomeKittens,"August 9, 2020","Great for the price!It writes smooth with only a little feedback.  I didn't think it was scratchy,
it doesn't skip, and has a clean line on most paper I've used it on.  The ink
looks good and dries quickly.  It is also more durable than I expected from
JetPens' test (I got some coffee on a page and it barely did anything).  The
cartridge is well made and easy to use.The only thing that kept it from 5 stars is that the EF writes almost the same
size as my F nib Pilot.  I would still recommend Preppy as a daily use pen. 
Really like the ink and cartridge."
xyrikosu,"December 26, 2018","writes good when it works, otherwise it dries up quickly and need to scribble a
lot"
treemerryweather,"November 2, 2018","I used a fountain pen in elementary school and the Platinum Preppy is a
nostalgic choice for me. This is my second 02 nib and there was a learning
curve. Like others I had trouble with dry out. Today the humidity is 17% and
that happens frequently in my coastal desert environment. I store my Preppy pens
upside down in a lidded jar. the 02 stays moist in the jar and only occasionally
have i had to really work the pen to get the ink flowing again. So I am happy
with the pen. I am satisfied with the nib size and I love the feelings of being
a student that come with the pen."
kara.kaminski,"August 28, 2020","I was very excited to learn there was a Preppy EF option, and this does not
disappoint! I wish it came in all of the other colors, but I will use other inks
in it."
ultrayankee,"June 29, 2020","I adore this pen!  And it was so inexpensive!  I have been looking for an
extremely fine-tipped fountain pen For a while and not a disposable one.  The
ink is blue-black which I really like since I usually only by blue ink in any
type of pen. I have been very happy with all my purchases from JetPens, and this
is no exception!"
Evan,"May 10, 2020","Excellent for very small writing. I love the Preppy and the Plaisir. They're
durable enough for everyday carry and cheap enough that you'll never worry about
them. You can also give one away to a friend that's interested in fountain pens.
I recommend the 03 for that though. "
shahaniaoscar,"March 29, 2020","It writes surprisingly smoothly for how small the nib is. Typically extra fine
nibs are much more scratchy. Love it for annotations on school texts!"
OrangePatty1,"March 6, 2020","I bought my first Preppys when they were introduced 10? years ago.  I got every
color I could, in the 02 sized nib.  I love the Japanese extra-fine nibs!!  Now
days, I save the cartridges and clean them, and refill them with my favorite
colors.  I wish I could get new 02 nibs; one pen dropped, and bent the nib, and
I like the 03 pen colors, too!  I just miss orange, my favorite color.  The
Preppy is a very dependable pen, and the price is great!  The 02 nib is perfect,
if you prefer a very fine line.  I will put a nice turquoise blue ink in this
one.  Thanks!"
donsatalic,"July 17, 2019",You just can't beat the 02 nib for smoothness at this price.
orgchemistken,"May 15, 2019","Great pen, I was going to just try it out then upgrade to a more pricey pen.
Turns out I like this one just fine."
torik1,"May 10, 2019","I wish I could give 4.5 stars for this product.  This is due to the fact that
unlike other extra fine preppy pens, this pen appears to have ink flow issues. 
you have to shake it every now and then to get the ink flowing again. 
Everything else about this pen is superb though.  Writing with it is enjoyable
and the blue black ink is a great color.  "
mickey.schulz,"January 25, 2019","I've used these for years.  They have excellent points, and are inexpensive so
you don't feel bad if you lose one. The only problem has been accessibility,
because only one store in my area carried them, but knowing that you guys have
them makes getting replacements and more ink cartridges much easeir.  "
cacarlson86,"January 6, 2019","Performs very much as expected, which is coincidentally far greater than the
cost. Makes for a great every day pen that can use cartridges or be eyedropper
filled. I'm considering the converter, but seems a bit overkill given the
additional cost and how easily it is filled with an eyedropper."
NontradStudent,"December 4, 2018","I got this pen to use with the blue highlighter cartridges for marginal notes.
In use, I use a blue highlighter to mark subject matter I need to go back over
then use this pen to expand on why there is blue highlighting in the text. It
works very well for that."
johnwoods02219,"October 18, 2018","Warning. This pen is NOT extra fine the description on the pen and website
notwithstanding. It writes like a medium. You get what you pay for.  "
Doctor Memory,"October 3, 2018","Very disappointed, the feed in my example keeps going dry. It will write a word
or two, then simply stop. If I wait a second, it will start again, but only
write a letter or two. It seems to work better if I write slowly, but that's no
help. I have tried flushing the nib with soapy water, but that only helped for a
little while. Shame, as when it works it's a great pen but it's basically
useless the way it is."
sohgrove,"December 13, 2022","This is a great little pen. I thought that I would like the extra fine nib more
but I find that it dries up more easily and there is less ink flow. I'm not a
professional pen reviewer, but I am still giving this one a try to see if
there's more merit in the extra fine nib."
asherr.ren,"October 26, 2022","If you know how to use this pen it can be an absolute game changer, and this is
a current must-have for me. Jetpens videos recommend the 02 extra fine nib for
lower quality paper like copy paper. I use it for bullet journaling and copy
paper, and is the pen I automatically pick up if I'm worried about any potential
bleedthrough. It's also recommended as a beginner friendly fountain pen and I
found it to be extremely helpful to train myself on the proper writing position.
I think the ONLY downside, and why I say you need to use it correctly- I
occasionally experience inkflow issues. I'm not sure of the cause outside of
maybe I put the cartridge in wrong or I'm writing too fast. I say that because
if I open the pen and slightly jiggle the cartridge the inkflow seems to be
fixed, and when I slow down my writing the ink doesn't skip. But that could be
user error. Outside of that I wholeheartedly recommend this pen"
ccordova,"June 29, 2022","Nice pigment, and I love my Preppy Fountain pens!  The 0.2 extra fine nibs are
hard to find!"
Clifton R,"April 30, 2022","The Platinum ""Preppy"" pens are all an extraordinary value. Even among them, this
one is a particular stand-out - at only around $5 it's got one of the best Extra
Fine nibs among all the under-$50 fountain pens, and it's got a great Blue-black
ink cartridge loaded to start with. It's very comfortable in the hand, a comfortable size and weight - I feel I
could write with it all day. The 02 Extra Fine nib on this pen produces a very
fine line - almost as fine as the Pilot EF, which is one of the best - without
any feel of scratchiness. Another reviewer described it as having similar
feedback to a sharp HB pencil, which is about right. The Blue Black ink has excellent contrast, and it's good either for general
writing or for color-coded notes and annotations.I very much like this shade of Blue-black ink; it's been one of my favorites.
While I've been replacing the inks in most of my other Platinum Preppy pens with
assorted color cartridges, I'm sticking with this one for a consistent and
readable blue-black."
davidschumaker,"June 29, 2018",Best pens for the price I have ever found. I use them for urban sketching.

writing.Comfortable feel for a plastic pen."
stokerblake1,"March 7, 2022","Decent cheap fountain pen. Writes smoothly but I haven't figured out how to
fully disassemble it for cleaning yet. Changing out inks seems like a bit of a
challenge with these pens, but I have yet to try. The plastic feels like
plastic, its a cheap pen, you kinda get what you pay for. That being said, they
feel like durable plastic, and the nib truly is extra fine, produces very crisp
thin lines. However, I do not recommend using the stock ink, it is a very watery
gray-blue that does not look good. It also seeped out of the feed and filled
that chamber, which did not happen when I used other inks in the pen. The cap
does seal very well, I have not had any issues with the pens drying out."
debravaloff,"March 6, 2022",Really enjoy this pen. Comfortable in the hand and an very fine nib.

quality are fantastic.  "
foxdenfarms7,"January 18, 2022",Already a 5 star pen. The extra fine Japanese nib. Perfect. 
Emma,"December 29, 2021","I picked up this pen as more of a toss in my notebook cover pen that I wouldn't
have to worry about it. The nib writes smoother than I thought it would, from
what I've heard about Platinum. As far as the body material goes, I would say it
toes the line between sturdy and brittle, if that makes sense. It won't fall
apart in your hands, but if you drop it on the floor it may be over for the
body. I would buy it again though, it seems like a nice pen for what you pay
for."
mike,"December 18, 2021","Works beautifully with the cartridge it came with. This might be use error but I
had flow issues when i tried to use a converter the ink flow was kinda splotchy.
Otherwise it is not scratchy as LONG as the ink flow is good."
quenerramirez,"December 9, 2021","This pen is great , only downside is that the barrels breaks of its too tight. "
Duke,"November 26, 2021","The 02 nib isn't what I remember from the past but is still okay.  As for the
blue-black ink, is this really the best Platinum can offer?  It is about as
inspiring as a colonoscopy."
scho,"October 15, 2021","I keep buying this pen because it's a cheap fountain pen. But it's not a great
pen. If you're looking for something you won't mind losing, this is the best pen
for that. It's got a good feel, and is smooth a lot of the times. But if you
haven't used it in a while, it takes a few hours or so to get the ink flowing
well again. "

cltinseattle,"May 28, 2021","I'm not feeling the love for this pen.  I tried it because of all the hype and
the good reviews.  The extra fine nib on my Preppy is not even close to being
extra fine.  It's not even fine, it's more like a medium, and that is a deal
breaker for me.  I thought this would be a good choice for an inexpensive
knock-around pen that I wouldn't be afraid to lose but no, I really dislike the
heavy line this pen lays down.  I probably will be looking for someone to give
this pen away to because I have no use for it.  For my knock-around pen I will
stick with my Kakuno.  The Kakuno extra fine really does produce a nice,
pleasant fine line."
jetpens enjoyer,"May 27, 2021","I had high hopes for this pen, I really did! I loved the design, was a big fan
of the ink, and was excited for the extra fine nib that my western fountain pens
couldn't provide. But only after a few days of use, the barrel cracked while I was trying to uncap
this thing. I'm not even that strong; my muscles have withered and disintegrated
during lockdown. I taped it up very carefully and put it aside for use later,
but lo and behold, it cracked on the other side when I tried opening it later!
What!!  Unless my muscle mass has suddenly decided to return to me out of nowhere and
smash the cheap plastic barrel of this pen to establish dominance I don't know
what to say. Be careful of your massive, herculean grip strength while you
handle this thing I guess...  (The ink is still good and the nib is awesome though.)"
michellebbrunson,"April 26, 2021",Perfect for those who like an extra fine nib
jenpetcar,"April 20, 2021","Not as fine as a Kaweco Sport EF, in fact it doesn't seem to be any finer than a

eyedropper pen to be able to put more ink in it. There are A LOT of videos on
YouTube on how to do this. But basically, you just put an o-ring in the threads
and add silicone grease, et voilà! Now I want it in every color available!
Can't say enough how pleased I am with this inexpensive pen. Highly recommend
it!"

nutellacrepe,"December 17, 2020","Another advantage I haven't seen mentioned in reviews is the water-resistance of
the Preppy Ink.Years ago I had a very scratchy Preppy and a scratchy Plumix. I gave up on them
out of frustration. But I wanted to try again, esp. because I am using document
inks, some oxgall inks, to have smudge-proof or even waterproof writing. Some of
the oxgalls can be hard on your pen, so I wanted a low-cost pen to try them on.
I emptied the anemic-looking red Preppy ink, and refilled with a Monteverde red.
It's vibranter, but does smudge if rest my hand on a page later. This blue is
more blue-black, and I noticed that the ink doesn't smudge after it dries. My
unhygienic water test is to dribble a little saliva on my finger and drag it
across some writing. No smears! I am glad I gave the Preppy pens another try. "
mrsargent,"December 11, 2020","The Platinum Preppy pen is my favorite go-to fountain pen.  I use the black EF
pen everyday and love the flow of the ink.  The Blue EF pen, however, just
doesn't seem the same.  My first blue black EF didn't start the same as the
black (though the cap design was to prevent this) and the lines continuously
broke.  Given how wonderful the black EF nib worked, I figured this one
particular nib was an outlier.  So, I ordered a second one and am having the
same issues, which really doesn't make sense.  Again, the black EF pen is my
favorite and I constantly use it.  The blue EF (and I know this doesn't make
sense) continues to be a pain.  I might try one more order ... third time's
charm, right?"
sheilasuesides,"November 23, 2020","I enjoy my Platinum Preppies.   I modified them, and they leaked badly.   But, I

colors."
patty43123,"October 7, 2020","The Platinum Preppy 02/extra fine nib is similar to the nibs on Pilot's EF
Kakuno or Penmanship pens. If a very fine line is what you're after, I recommend
this pen! I bought several of these and converted them to eyedroppers using the
silicone grease and O-rings from the JetPens accessory bundle. A couple of them
leaked where the barrel met the grip. I'm not sure if I made a mistake or if
this is common but I'll use cartridges or converters with these in the future
just to be on the safe side."

Beng,"November 19, 2008","After trying 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mm (I didn't try 0.25 because I knew it would be
too thin) I find this pen to be the best. The 0.5 mm line was a bit too thick
for me and was similar to a Sarasa, while the 0.3 mm would lose its ink flow
once in a while and I would have to shake it a bit. I found the 0.4 mm to be
just right, and the Blue-Black ink color is the best. This is going to be the
pen that I do all of my work with."
lian.tiffany,"February 24, 2011","After all is said and done, I think a combination of Sliccis and Hi Tec C's
would be a perfect addition to any pencil case. The blue-black pen i got was veryvery inky, moreso than usual and I love it! it
writes in nice dark lines. However, it does run out of ink fairly quickly. They
are both very unscratchy and you can write nice and smoothly with them.  The 0.25 is way too thin for me, and I only bought it to write my finals
notecard in (because its basically a notecard where you write as much info as
you can. therefore having a thinner pen works very well).  After writing with both the Hi Tec C and Slicci in 0.4, I would say both the
tips are fine. The Slicci tip is noticeably sturdy, but the Hi Tec C is fine
too. Unless you write amazingly heavily, it is no problem. However, the Hi Tec C
tip is nicer looking compared to the slicci one. Also, the Hi Tec C has a wider
barrel and a hexagonal shape, which is easier to grip than the slicci's small
circle shape.  Overall, I love both of these pens, and I think they're a lot better than
Sarasas. Signos are also nice, but get a 0.38 because 0.28 Signos are rather
scratchy."
sh02266,"December 3, 2009","This pen is perfect for people who write small. I've been looking for a pen that
wouldn't turn my small handwriting into a muddled, incomprehensible blob of ink.
So far, the pen hasn't skipped and it's not scratchy either. Heavy handed
writers beware: the tip of the pen could bend if you bear down heavily. The
shade of ink is awesome as well. I'm not a fan of black ink, and blue ink can be
a little iffy. This blue/black shade is wonderful.  If you plan on writing for a long period of time (i.e: in class) you might want
to find a grip. It's not easy on the fingers. Overall, I'd say this pen is pretty much amazing."
djszekeres,"November 9, 2009","I have finally found my favorite pen! I had heard all sorts of good things about
the Hi-Tec-C pens, and finally got around to trying them. The 0.4mm Blue Black
pen will be my writing instrument of choice for as long as I can get my hands on
it. It's a precisely fine line in a wonderful shade. I have not had any issues
with the ink skipping, and have found the pen to write wonderfully every time."
phirun123,"January 29, 2013","I LOVE THESE PENS!!!!!First of all, people love to diss the plastic barrel quality. I would like to
say that it is PERFECTLY fine! There's nothing wrong with it. The lightweight
construction reduce fatigue when writing for long session and I would know
because I would sit and write and study for 12 hours with minimal breaks! The
lightweight helps and it's very comfortable as well.  Second, this blue black color is, by far, THE best blue black I've ever tried. I
love the color very much. I can't really describe it, but it's just right. Third, the 0.4mm, is the perfect size to write notes with. It's not too large,
too thin, it's just perfect. However, you do have to let the ink run after a word or so. The ink can be
scratchy for a word or so, but that is NOT a concern whatsoever.  Now for the best part, it is less than 4$!!!! it writes so much better than some
quality pens that run in the hundreds *cough cough Montblanc* So just get one
and try it out before making a judgement and perhaps in the future you'll save
hundreds by using this pen. Have fun writing with it!"
Rodney,"August 15, 2016","Oh, yeah. This is the one. After weeks of frustration trying to take notes with my Hi-Tec-C .3mm pen I have
found the sweet spot with the .4mm. It's the perfect thickness for anyone who
likes a slim line with no skipping. The blue black color is my favorite for work
because it looks professional but is still unique.As for the .3mm, I simply added it to my art kit and still love it for drawing
lines. It's great for my style of drawing which revolves around geometry.Verdict: the Hi-Tec-C is a great gel pen for all types of inking. You just have
to find the right tool for the job."

Francesca,"February 6, 2021","I bought this Blue-Black pen to complete my set; I was hoping that this
blue-black would be the same colour as the Pilot Juice Blue-Black, but it
isn’t. The Hi-Tec-C has a green tinge to it, while the Juice has a red tinge.
I much prefer the Juice. The Hi-Tec-C writes smoothly on most of my papers,
catching slightly on the papers that have a bit of texture, like the Graphilo,
for example, or the lowest grade photocopy paper. The tip is thin yet seems
sturdy. I haven’t damaged it yet; then again, I have a light hand. It works
very well with the Hobonichi stencils. Again, I’m not crazy about the colour,
but the pen itself didn’t disappoint me."

noticeable when you write on a single sheet of paper over a hard surface.  If
you are writing in a notebook or something that has several layers of paper
beneath it, the scratchy feeling is not noticeable. -Pricey"
tesabee,"August 16, 2020","Smooth and lovely! Resists alcohol ink perfectly! It only needs a few seconds to
dry and it can be immediately colored over with copic, Ohuhu, or any other
alcohol based marker. No skipping, smooth even lines and quick dry time (5
minutes max and erasing doesn’t even smudge it). It does not hold up to water
based marker Like Tombow brush, or water color (get a pilot multi ball for that)
but if you’re looking for a fine liner that doesn’t budge with your copics,
this is it! "

seriously blown away at the comfort, the weight and the quality of the gel ink. 
It writes so smoothly with no effort, no skipping and no smudging.I was concerned that the grip would get easily dirty because it is white but it
has remained clean and without any stains even after near constant use at work
where I handle money a lot.  I love the color of the embellishments.  Highly
recommend this pen!"

but the 0.5mm seems to be MUCH thicker than any other 0.5mm pen I have? It is
even thicker looking than my 0.7mm pens. Also, when writing it doesn’t
necessarily skip, but the thickness levels seems to vary a lot and doesn’t
have a consistent flow of ink? This make my writing look really messy. Other
than the inconsistent ink flow and the thick 0.5mm point, it is really a great
pen. Ink dries fast, looks very dark, and is smooth. "

ZoeOB,"April 4, 2018","Sometimes you just need a basic pen that's not too expensive and writes well. I
bought this one after reading one of JetPens guides. I like the weight of it,
the handy clip, point sizes and rubberized (but not sticky or gummy) grip. It's
become one of my favorite ""I need a pen"" pen. "
inquisitive1too,"April 18, 2018",Fits my hand well and writes like it's on glass. Ink does not bleed through.
reginaford,"March 11, 2008","I am a cancer screening lab tech who uses these pens to mark abnormal cells on
glass microscope slides. My profession has been looking for a white pen that
writes well on glass and fits under the objective lens of the microscope for
thirty years. Finally! A pen that does the job. These are great! They mark
precisely where we want and flow well. The lines show up nicely on the
background of the black microscope stage. Don't ever stop making these or I'll
have to retire..."
sodakissed,"April 28, 2015","Love them. So opaque. So nice. The only problem is that, as expected, if you use
them over a medium that can bleed, it will turn that color. :c They're also really thick and not good for super tiny detail work. I wish they
had a similar pen in a smaller size, but the jellyroll pen doesn't even stand up
to the opacity this pen has. The down side is that because it does use a lot of
ink, they run out really fast which is why I suggest buying them in a 10 pack. I
ran two out of ink just adding highlights to a 24""x16"" piece. I've since bought
another pack and will probably purchase more in the future."

aobehel,"December 23, 2013","I am a professional calligrapher and this is my go-to when I need white gel ink.
 It is very opaque and bright on the darkest  paper.  The only issues I have
found...if you write too quickly the ink will occasionally ""skip"". It is not as
free flowing as the signo gold and silver inks.  And warning...this ink WILL
smear on certain surfaces.  I recently did an order of very high quality black
envelopes with a tight,smooth finish and had to put tissue paper between each
one as when they were stacked they did smudge onto the adjacent envelopes.  The
writing itself does not smear..but the residue did and I had to use and art
eraser to get off the smudge marks. Also happened on an order of navy envelopes.
Does not seem to happen on Kraft or lighter, less heavy weight paper where the
ink absorbs into the paper more instead of sitting on the surface...but do
beware it can and will leave white marks on some papers if they touch.  Would
also love to see signo design this line so that you can see when the ink is
getting low in the barrel....a bit of a pain as you usually cannot use this pen
until it is completely empty and it starts to ""fade"" in brightness about with
about 1/4"" ink or more left but you cannot see the ink level."
cottonswab44,"February 23, 2012","The best white ink gel pen I have ever used!  I never thought I would find
another white gel pen ever again.  You certainly can't buy these things from

nuada2723,"November 8, 2012","The pens themselves are great. You can write quickly with them and expect a
decent line. My only complaint is that if you hold the pen at too shallow an
angle, the edges of the tip will scratch/smear the ink as you write. Other thoughts: One thing I didn't really care for is that a box is pictured. I
received no such box, just 10 pens. Not a big deal... I just expected a box of
pens like in the photo."
mrsmackulics,"October 12, 2011","I have purchased these pens in the past and thought they were made in the

went to your site and ordered the box set for me.  It may be my imagination, but
these pens write better.  In fact, they are the whitest pens on the market.  In
addition, they seem to have more ink then their counterpart.  They're
astonishing.  I just ordered my second box. I won't use any other. Neena."

friendly artist,"September 4, 2022","It's a beautiful pen, but I will note that the materials don't really seem
""premium"" to me-- the plastic already got scratched up a bit in the first week
of use. It already looks more beat-up than my Lamy Safari, which I've had for
several years and still looks new.I also had to pretty much immediately buy a fine replacement nib for this. The
broad nib only seemed to actually write broadly on cheap, absorbent copy paper.
It was finicky and unsatisfying to use-- though the nib was smooth, it was so
smooth that the ink often had trouble getting a ""grip"" on the paper. For me, the
fine replacement nib was a much better fit for this pen-- a WAY better writing
experience and a smarter fit for the pen's extremely limited ink capacity
(especially since the only converter that fits this pen is absolutely tiny). "
elliebean,"May 4, 2022","Iridescent Pearl is a striking limited edition.  The color alone is reason
enough to purchase this beautiful pen!!This was the first broad nib from Kaweco I purchased.  I typically buy extra
fine or fine nibs.  Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed by the nib's performance.
 It seems to act a bit more than I would expect.  Tends to be a dryer writer
with an uneven flow.  If it continues to act up, I may have to get a replacement
nib for this pen.  "

starlitskvader,"January 13, 2023",Another of my daily go-tos! Very nice for small hands and writes beautifully!
Pen User,"January 10, 2023","I love the colour! I paired it with Ferris Wheel Press’ Tears of Sapphire
because of the pinkish sheen and the shimmer, which felt like it fit with the
iridescence of the pen.The plastic is kind of translucent, though, so the guts of the pen do appear
like a ghost in a family photo but it is still pleasant to view. I have small
hands so the body is not terribly small for me; however, I do need the cap
posted for the best hand fit.The reason why it is four stars is because of the writing experience. Compared
to my Sailor or even the two platinum preppies (because the sailor might be an
unfair comparison) I have, the nib skips a lot. Maybe it’s the ink I use but
it doesn’t provide a consistently smooth write, especially with looping
letters like ‘o’ or ‘a’, so I have to go back over the lines again.
Writing with it is a bit tedious because of the backtracking.Also, ink has been leaking a little into the cap.I feel like it is an okay pen overall."
ahoffmeister198,"December 6, 2022","Got this in broad and love it. One thing I wanted to point out with this pen and
the frosted yellow one is, the first time I took them out the package and opened
them up they were a little squeaky when unscrewing the cap and nib section. The
sound was the equivalent to nails on a chalkboard for me so I put a tiny amount
of silicone grease on the threads and problem solved. "

carveitfast,"August 28, 2009","Now this is a brush pen's brush pen. It's what most other brush pens wish they
were. Simple elegant class all the way. It's light like a regular brush so the
switch between the two is almost effortless. And when you plug a Platinum ink
converter into it your ink choices are infinite. The most useful inks that I've
found to use in this pen so far are Noodler's Bullet Proof Black and Platinum's
Carbon Black with the Carbon Black being slightly more useful if your into heavy
watercolor washes as it doesn't bleed that tiny little bit that the Noodler's
BPB does. The brush itself has been the most responsive of the synthetic styles
that I have used so far, at least for my style of line work, it has a crisp snap
so that going from a hairline to the broadest of line and back again is as near
to intuitive as I've found in a synthetic. And if you're a serious line junkie
you can easily convert this puppy into an eyedropper fill pen with a 1/16""
diameter (hard to find so if you don't mind a bit of a bump between the pen
barrel and nib section you can use an 1/8"" diameter washer found at any hardware
store) 1/4"" washer and some silicone grease on the threads and you have yourself
a brush pen that can hold an 1/8 of a bottle of ink and it'll lay down lines for
days. Just remember to keep the nib upright as it can bleed like crazy if
dropped or stored nib down with that much ink in it."
ebenfatto,"March 3, 2012","This is a wonderful drawing tool. My first brush pen was the Pentel Pocket one,
and it is a lovely pen. But this Kuretake has a higher quality brush with more
spring and a finer point. I am really enjoying it. Just fyi, I use Platinum Carbon ink cartridges instead of the supplied ink,
because the Platinum ink is waterproof and dries near instantly on most papers.
Happily the Platinum and Kuretake cartridges are identical to each other (even
down to the little metal ball),  and the Platinum converter fits this pen
beautifully as well. I've had absolutely no problems with inkflow."
DarrellBerr,"November 21, 2013","OKAY IF YOUR A ARTIST THAT'S CONTEMPLATING BUYING THIS PEN.. DO IT!!!!!!!!haha. i haven't tried any other brush pens so i cant compare this to any other
one in performance, but.. i draw alot, and this pen is something i can use for
everything. i draw manga influenced illustrations and i can create lines of
basically any width that i please from broad blunt lines to TINY THIN HAIR LINES
litterally the smallest a line could get probably with any medium. though, at
first i was so frustrated with the sensitivity of the pen, literally the tiniest
bit of pressure can vary the line drastically so i was really having a hard time
keeping control. but after a few hours of just messing with the pen i can lay
out lines of the width i please. its all just getting used to it and after that
you'll be in love! definitely worth the price. came in packaged nice, no damage,
no tiny little scratches on the item, so if your a weirdo like me that worry
about that then that clears it up xD -overall review-LOOKS GREATFEELS GREATPERFORMS AMAZINGLY oh and the ink it comes with is actually great and solid. not waterproof, soooo
like said in many reviews or descriptions you can convert it and blah blah if
you are working with other wet mediums. but if not then theres nothing bad about
this ink at all, flows like a dream and looks really clean. no fizzyness. just take my word and buy this and give it some practice. itll open up so many
doors as a artist and really make your work look authentic and lively ^^"
duoc9119,"April 24, 2012","I've had this pen for about a week so far and absolutely love the pen. I've been
using the standard Winsor & Newton Series 7 brushes, but they are becoming hard
to find without ordering, and the constant dipping was getting old (not to
mention the few times I turn to dip, I knock the bottle of indian ink over) So I thought I would try a brush pen to avoid spillage but still get the same
brush feel, and it was probably the best decision I've made so far.  Ink that is supplied isn't waterproof and I found that when dried, it has a dark
brown tint rather than flat black. So I ordered a few cartridges of Carbon Black
and a bottle of it.  Is it truly confirmed that the No. 40 replacement tip will fit on the No. 13? If
so, I would like to convert it over to the natural sable. I found that the nylon
brush tip is a bit slow on flow when taking fast strokes, and maybe a natural
hair tip would fix it.  May be getting a second to use exclusively with the Platinum Converter for
colored inks/washes, or just for non-waterproof cartridges for sketching. "
TheHOINK,"November 16, 2008","Hello, and a wonderfull (whatever daytime you might be reading this...) Interesting, for such an infamous pen with these fast de- and increasing numbers
in any shops, that I am the first to write a short review here... nice. The Kuretake DV140-13C is one of the better Bruspens I have used.It's nylon bristles range, in flexibilitx and resiliency between the Kuretake
Phys Waterbrush Pens and the Pentel FP10 GFKP Brush Pen.The Bristles spring back to a sharp point, but sometimes it needs a short while
with the pen closed, before it's tip is sharp again for working on crisp lines,
especially after filling in larger areas, which stresses the bristles a lot. After nearly two months and 8 used cartridges, the tip looks quite like new, so
the possibility to buy spare/replacement tips/nibs is great and counts as a
plus, but it is not necessary too often, a second plus. The Pen closes with a wonderfull clicking sound, and you can feel the
""reistance"" of the pen while closing the cap, so you know it is ""closed"" and
tight. It gives you a good feeling about the bristles not getting too much air
and drying out. The Barrel and Cap are made out of Aluminium it seems, it seems more durable in
feel and more elegant in look than the Pentel GFKP. Maybe thus the price is so
much higher. The Pen is very lightweight, more lightweight than the Pentel GFKP, could be a
little heavier, depending on the user, it's up to you whether this is good or
bad.  The Price is very moderate for a pen of this quality. The Ink is a very dark and saturated black, watersoluble and even after drying
not waterproof. If you want to make washes or use aquarellistic colours on your
paintings, do it before using the Kuretake-ink, and you will be fine. Kuretake DV140-13C only gets four of five stars because I prefer natural sable
bristles, more stable, more sharp lines, and a better control of the line, like
on the Kuretake DV140-40 oder DV140-50.Anyway, it is still one of the best brush pens I have ever had the luck to own,
thanks to JetPens. ^_^ TheHOINK"
JSFink,"April 5, 2018","Excellent brush pen for drawing, inking or fine detailing.  Because of the way I
hold it, I find this easier to use than a regular paint brush or 102 quill. 
Good, solid construction and really feels like a professional tool.The #40 replacement tips -ARE- compatible with the #13 body.  Personally, I like
the construction of the #13 body more with how the pocket clip is attached to
the cap.  The #40 sable tips are a definite improvement over the synthetic.  If
you do buy a tip, it includes the entire front end of the pen, not just the
bristles.  So really when you buy the pen you are getting the cap and back
section plus one initial tip.The feed system is a long felt or paper tube from what I saw when cleaning it. 
I first used it with Speedball Super-Black india ink which does work without
clogging/drying, but I found it too thick overall.  Note, I sketch so much now
that I've never let this sit more than a few days (less than a week) without
usage.  I've since switched to Rapidograph ink that seems to flow much better,
and blends in with Copic Multiliner SP inks when dry.The tip is definitely capable of lines thinner than the smallest fine-liner if
you get a good tip, or aren't afraid (have the money) to play with it.  As the
bristles fray, I pull them out with a pair of tweezers (and this happens very
rarely at that).  I've used this pen over the course of a year and haven't had
to replace the tip yet.  It is capable of light fill-work, if you go slowly and
at an angle.  I would not try to ""paint"" with it unless you are going for
dry-brush effect.Very satisfied overall.  Will be keeping this as my primary inking tool and
ordered another sable tip just in case."
nday11,"December 18, 2010","Most pleased. It writes from a thick line down to a single hair. It feels
smooth. No ink flow problems. The Platinum converter works fine.It's better than my Pentel Pocket Brush."
liberty7melody,"September 21, 2010","This Kuretake Fountain Hair Brush Pen is not only a beautifully designed brush
pen, but also an excellent writting brush pen. I have used this brush pen or
more than 40 year (Of course I used more than 10 of them during these years). I
just love it and can recommend for any person who is intereted in trying to use
it without reservation. I only wish that the company can also produce and sale
the larger brush tip ones, so that people can buy them for use to write
characters of medium and large sizes as well. (If not now, perhaps in the
future.) Signed,Charles Y. Yang"
ninevoltart,"March 2, 2010","$30 may seem pretty steep for a brush pen, but this is worth it! I decided to
try this brush pen after I was very happy with my Pentel Pocket, but wanted
something with a thinner tip. Yes, the tip is thinner (but considering I work
with a 6/0 brush when I'm inking sometimes, it's still big to me), but you can
also get some fairly bold lines out of it. I am very happy with it. It is
extremely good quality, enough that I've inked final pieces with it instead of a
regular brush-- it looks that good.  Compared to the Pentel Pocket, the ink seems much ""wetter"" and darker. It takes
a bit longer to dry, so it's easy to accidentally smudge it. However, it works
better on paper with a little ""tooth"" than the Pentel does.  If you only use a brush pen once in a while, buy the less expensive Pentel
Pocket. But if you want to make an investment and plan to use the pen
constantly, go for it."
Ashi Kimiko,"December 28, 2020","The pen itself, is Extremely affordable for such a high quality Gorgeous
looking/fun using pen! The Gold trim of the logo and the clip is an Awesome eye
catcher! It writes and draws ridiculously well! Thinking of using this pen for drawing? Dude, buy this pen you won't be
disappointed! Thinking of using a fountain for drawing, then just get an extra
fine clear pilot kakuno with a con-70 converter, but if you want to be fancy and
get a pen with a gold nib for drawing then the only pen you'll ever need is the
pilot falcon soft extra fine nib. And if you want to draw the lines of your
drawing before inking it up I recommend the uni advance mechanical pencil with
hi-uni 0.5 lead to draw the outline of your drawing, I bought the one with the
black/gold spirited away picture on it. And all of the products I mentioned can
be bought here on jetpens dude! Sweet.I ordered mine with the kuretake no 50 red brush fountain pen because there was
only five left and I wanted to get one before they ran out again.The number 13 and number 50 and 40 brush pens all use the same synthetic/nylon
brush tips but you can buy the sable hair brush tip for your no 13's and it will
fit it.Guys, if you want draw Beautiful pieces of art.......buy this freaking pen dude.
I cannot believe I didn't know about the existence of these kuretake brush pens
before I spent a lot on my pilot custom 912 falcon nib fountain pen, I use this
pen more than my custom 912 and it only cost me this price! Wow.I've seen a lot of expensive fountain pens and this pen truly does look like a
japanese maki-e urushi laquer $1,000.00 to $5,000.00 pen! Don't be intimidated by the price tags of the no 13 and no 40 and 50 pens, I
once saw a mickey mouse disney fountain pen that cost $1,050.00 and believe me
these kuretake brush pens are way cooler, more affordable, Gorgeously Exquisite
Japanese Craftmanship, and much funner to write/draw with!I usually draw pictures of Gorgeous women like Jessica Rabbit, Elizabeth Taylor,
Monica Roccaforte, Debora Caprioglio, etc. I then started to draw them with my
kuretake brush pens and WOW, my drawings became so Beautiful! I even drew Ashi
from season 5 of samurai jack with rock n roll 1980's groupie hairstyles and the
line variation I got with these brush pens was insanely Awesome!Dude, buy these pens you will not be disappointed!"
joanamiranda,"April 20, 2019","A truly beautiful pen.  The weight of the pen feels great in my hand and the
dark black ink flow is smooth and silky. The ink is waterproof so I can paint
over it without any feathering or bleeding.  A big plus is that the pen is
refillable - which means less plastic going into the environment."
Anonymous,"March 28, 2019","The Pentel Pocket Brush pen has been popular among many fellow artists, but I
personally did not resonate with the hype. There was something about that brush
pen in particular that didn't click with me and I didn't know why. That is...
until I tried out this Kuretake No. 13 Fountain Brush Pen! The answer became so
apparent when I noticed how the bristles snapped back to a fine point after
applying various degrees of pressure. As a result, I was able to achieve finer
control and did not end up with unexpected marks. It was kind of reminiscent of
working with watercolors where a good round watercolor brush can maintain its
point. When I made that connection, I understood finally what my personal
preferences were for brush pens (and perhaps brushes in general). The Pentel
Pocket Brush Pen, by comparison, did not hold up to that same sharp point and I
had to frequently reshape the tip in order to achieve delicate lines when
needed. Yup... this Kuretake brush pen is THE holy grail of brush pens for me!"
Mister Twister,"May 11, 2017","This is currently the best brush pen one can get, and I am not exaggerating.
Both the bristle material, and the way the body harnesses hairs to keep a sharp
point, ensures that said point remains sharp most of the time, and requires
minimal work to re-sharpen. The like is easy to control, and relatively easy to
keep thin, giving you better control of what ends up on paper. The body is
mostly plastic, but good plastic, with some small metal inclusions, like the
holder. The only flaw of this set is the ink which, while quality, is not
waterproof. Kuretake currently does not produce waterproof ink (that may
change), and it is a challenge finding good ink that wouldn't ruin the bristles.
Thankfully, I was told about Platinum Carbon Ink (which conveniently also comes
in compatible cartridges). It is waterproof, and works wonders with No. 13. It
bleeds just a little on some types of paper, but only if you draw very slow, so
I recommend you get faster with your strokes!I suggest everyone buy this pen with Platinum >Carbon< Ink as a bundle of sorts.
Until something better arrives on the market, this brush pen is the best."
djkhimtaka,"July 2, 2014","This was my first ever brush pen (and fountain pen in general, now that I think
of it), and I've had it for years upon years now. Only now is it starting to
show a bit of wear and tear, so it's a resilient little guy. That said, the nib
only looks frayed when the bristles are clean and dry. While inked, it looks and
feels nearly brand new. As for function, it's line widths range from single-hair-thin to 5/8"" wide (yes,
I just measured that with a ruler). The bristle length is shorter compared to
the Pentel Pocket Brush, and this allows for more control while writing or
drawing. The ink is a neutral black, saturated, and works very well in wet-media
applications. Watercolor and sumi, anyone? I actually only use the Kuretake No. 13's front section these days.. as the body
portion of the pen has been taken over by the No. 40 nib I bought. The Kuretake
cartridges seat firmly onto the feed, so I don't even require the body portion.
Instead, I now have a short pen the size of a Pilot Petit with lots of control
thanks to the cartridge's snug fit. (And in case you're wondering, I use the
clear plastic cap that came with my 40 nib to keep my No. 13 nib from drying
out. :D ) The combo of cartridge, nib, and cap make for a compact travel-pen for
sketching on the go. I probably wouldn't just chuck it in my pocket, however..
But for me it's rather safe in my sketch kit, so I'm sure if others wanted to do
the same, that would be the way to go."
poochacho,"October 6, 2009","This pen has held up beautifully for me - and the tip is just a bit stiffer than
a natural hair brush. I carry this around in my purse and have no leakage or
drying - the cap is very airtight. It's great for on the spot inking! At first
you think it's kind of cheap looking when you open the package, but that's just
because it's not over decorated. It's very well made! Light but sturdy. I adore
this pen!"
Laura,"January 14, 2022","Wonderful for Asian writing - get the sable brush tip replacement for maximum
writing pleasure. Can do very fine to very broad lines when handled correctly.
Compact and easy to carry unlike disposable brush pens. Sleek, professional
appearance."
biztos,"June 10, 2020","Lighter and smaller than expected, so should be good for travel.  Very nice
brush feel especially on smooth paper."
NovelTea,"February 28, 2017","One of my two indispensable brush pens. The body is metal, which I didn't
realize; it's never been cold to the touch. Also a good size to wrap your hands
around. The brush is very precise despite the synthetic material, and the ink
flow is fairly smooth. You will get dry brush if you try to make fat lines too
quickly, but that's not a bad thing. Due to the shape of the brush, it is easy
to control varying line width.Only con is that the ink used for the pen is not waterproof...it becomes much
more water resistant over the course of days, but never completely bleed proof.
I've heard you can use other cartridges/converter and inks such as Platinum
Carbon Black (if you want waterproof), but haven't tried it yet."
M Murphy,"July 24, 2015","The brush glides smoothly, the ink is dark, and if you let it dry for a bit you
can actually go over it with copics with no bleeding or streaking.Gotta be careful with the brush because it's individual bristles, so fast thick
lines will splay the bristles out and cause damage. You'll also want to be
careful when putting the cap back on, because I'm an idiot and totally ruined my
first one by smooshing the bristles with the lid. Go me."
bfly,"March 11, 2015","Probably my favorite, most reached-for brush pen out of the 8 varieties I own. I
actually prefer the synthetic bristles of this brush to the natural ones of my
Kuretake No. 40 to be honest. The springiness is just perfect. "
fkfishman1,"February 26, 2015","Lovely juicy brush pen, but it is best used for calligraphy, imo. It's just a
little too wet and lays down ink too heavily for sketching, unless you have a
much lighter hand than I have, I guess. However, I have also tried the Kuretake
No. 8 which is great fun to use for sumi-e sketching. The brush tip is a little
narrower and longer than the No. 13 and, combined with a longer, lighter pen
body, it makes the No. 8 easier to use in a looser more spontaneous way. But
both pens are great! "
khepworth,"December 11, 2014","This is the first ink brush pen I have ever bought, and I was not disappointed.
I love this pen! It is of very good quality for the price. And you can buy a
universal refill, so it is possible to use any ink in it."
lisachen0913,"December 6, 2013","I love this Kuretake brush pen.  I wasn't expecting much, but this pen is
wonderful. I use it for drawing, and the ink is a nice black, blacker than my
Pentel Pocket Brushpen.  The bristles are also more flexible and not as stiff. 
Even better, it's alcohol proof, so I can color over the pen strokes. The design
is sleek and nice to the eyes, plus as other reviewers have commented there's a
clicking sound when you close the cap, which complements the whole design.
Overall, a great buy."
sb,"November 7, 2013","I've used this brush pen for a couple of months, and I really like how it puts
down a line (I use it for drawing). But, the cap is so tight that it squeezes the pen and causes the pen to leak
slightly at one side.  I can't remove the cap, either, without wrapping both the
pen body and the cap so I get enough grip to remove the cap. I'm using the ink adapter, and I don't know whether the adapter is causing this
problem, or whether the problem is entirely within the cap. There's one thing for sure:  the ink isn't going to dry out!"
saachisingh93,"May 12, 2013","The perfect brush pen. The bristle tip is slightly shorter and snappier than the
Pentel's, making fine lines easier and slightly more controllable. This really
is a quality pen, with beautiful strokes and amazing potential. I wouldn't say
that the price difference between this and the Pentel is justified, but if you
want the absolute best, this would be it. Plus, the huge advantage with the
Kuretake No. 13 is that it can be fitted with Platinum Carbon ink cartridges (no
need for a converter- the cartridges are identical in shape!) so you can get the
blackest, most waterproof lines along with a stunning brush tip and beautiful
pen body. It does require a lot of practice to master if you haven't used brush
pens before, though, and even then is not suited for all kinds of artists- you
need to do slow, loving, fine, detailed work with this one- this is not for
quick, aggressive large scale drawings! "
yepunaci,"January 15, 2013","I think this is the best brush pen you can find.It can handle very small letters and the design looks luxurious.I am very satisfied."
thomas.levron,"October 3, 2011","Yes, this is a really nice pen but does it really worth the extra $ compare to
the gfkp ? that's the question I was really interested in. So, I bought them both, and as
many others, I prefer this one. However, I sometimes wish the ink flow to be a little faster - even if it create
a nice ""dry"" effect on some papers... dunno if some other ink and a converter
can help with this. Anyway, I love it, this is a great pen, precise, soft, a real pleasure to
use.... but I'm seriously thinking to buy a No 40 just to see if it could get
REALLY better. or maybe I ll only test with some Sable Hair replacement tip on
this one... if it fits."
DukenukemDesign,"August 10, 2011","I would like to add that I was surprised to find that this does not bleed with

Bella Marie,"October 2, 2022","I've always wanted to try a brush pen for art and so glad I went with this one!
I really wanted something I could add my own fountain pen ink into and play

to sable hair bristles too in the future."

body and the fact that it is more like a standard pen length rather than the
longer length that is used for some brush pens. "

water wash afterward. I use this in conjunction with prigma markers for really
detailed work and Yasutomo loose sumi ink. "

theqwervy,"April 16, 2018","A good beginner brush pen. The brush isn't of the absolute highest quality but it is sensitive and performs
smoothly and has a good consistent flow. The body is very solid, but the grip isn't the most ergonomic. The capping mechanism is very good; it has a very strong hold and wont be
letting that brush dry up anytime soon. The supplied ink cartridges are good but not the best; the black tends to lean
toward the brown side although they do suit the pen in terms of flow. Platinum
carbon pen ink cartridges are much better."

was a bit more stout, feels cheap."
loribarns,"December 4, 2017","So far i really like this pen. I put a converter in it so that i could use the
same ink that i use in my regular fountain pen. The only thing that bothers me
is that i occasionally have to clean drops of ink off of the body right above
the nib. Relatively minor, i just need to have a paper towel handy for the few
occasions that has happened."

emmett.catedral,"April 28, 2017","Springy and responsive. I'm using it with a platinum fountain pen converter and
lamy turquoise ink at the moment, and I love it. Would absolutely recommend. I

refill. Compatibility with a converter was top priority for me, and I'm
extremely satisfied."
jenel,"February 18, 2017","Elegant, beautifully made.  I also wound up getting the Kuretake No. 50

brush pen.  Many years ago I'd been given a refillable pocket carry brush pen
while in Tokyo and had not been able to find a replacement for it even in Little
Tokyo in L.A.  But JetPens has several high quality pocket type brush pens and
the No. 13 works very well.  Use it for small on-the-go sumi-e sketches.  Very
handy since I can just throw it in a pocket and roll."

howyd,"December 23, 2016","I am very impressed with this pen.  I haven't had it long enough to give it a 5,
but it's close.  The brush is stiff enough to spring back with a fine point. It
can put down a fairly consistent fine line which is what I want. I've been using
dip brushes for fine line style ink painting and wanted this for travel.  It
looks like it will perform nicely.  I'm looking forward to trying it with a
converter."

Christina R,"October 15, 2015","I WAS IN LOVE until I changed the ink cartridge.As an illustrator/comic artist, I tried this pen because the Pentel pocket brush
kept giving me streaky and overall bad lines (and yet it's beloved by some of my
favorite artists.) and even though the price put me off a tad, I gave it a go
anyway. AND I LOVED IT! The amount of details and variety you can get in this
pen was phenomenal! I couldn't put it down! But then ink ran out finally and it
needed a change. That's when the love ran out. As soon as the new ink cartridge snapped in and I went back to inking a drawing,
my fingers got covered in ink! I examined the pen and a small hole was
hemorrhaging the stuff! The only solution I could come up with was putting
drafting tape over the hole. But that made it hard to put the cap back on AND
the ink still managed to leak out!In summary: The pen was heavenly until it leaked an inky hell. I don't know if I
just got a bad pen or its a common problem, but they need to fix that because 28
bucks for something that only works on the first cartridge is a rip off."
electricabyss,"July 10, 2015","This is a very nice brush pen with synthetic bristles, similar to the pentel
pocket brush.  Unlike the pentel, though, this one has much darker ink included,
which is great for my on-the-go and convention sketches.  The ink is not
waterproof (hence the 4 stars), but is copic and marker safe, so a great little
pen.  While it is more expensive than the pentel, the pen also just looks really
nice and not as cheap, like you're carrying around a high-quality instrument."
ananasvolant,"March 17, 2015","It's all right but the ink did not react well on tracing paper. Also I find it
harder to control than a simple brush."

kat,"May 3, 2010","Excelent brush. even pul and a joy to use. I would have given it a 5 except for
the fact that after 6 months my cap would not stay on all the way. after an hour
or two it would pop off slightly, causing my brush to dry out. I had this
problem numberous times over a 3yr. period.  BUT I would definately consider getting this pen again and I have talked to
other people who had it with no cmplaints. It's worth the $$."
tr_whitney,"February 14, 2010","I just got this and after using it for a week, I really love this pen. It beats

different inks (something you can't do with the Pentel)."
anton,"August 17, 2009","Great pen. I prefer this to the Pentel. It's lighter, classier, and I think the
ink is a little darker, too. It's on the thin side, but if you're used to watercolour brushes you won't mind."
hhuy888,"March 18, 2016","Pen was nice, but brush was too soft to my taste. I intended to use it for

catplanet,"April 4, 2015","For its price, this is a great pen. I love the control I have with the tip and,
though it has worn down a bit for me, I am pretty hard on it and it's kept up
pretty well. Ink dries quickly, which is great for me because I go over and
around my work a lot. I carry it every day! while I do like this pen a lot, I
will probably try to find a pen with a felt tip that is a bit more sturdy, and
hopefully refillable. I don't like disposables )':Note on ""disposable"" pens: An experiment I did with a pilot brush pen: if you
don't care as much about the exact ink color or particular properties of the ink
you're using, try this. Boil water and dip the body of the pen in the water, tip
facing up. Let it sit for a few seconds to heat the pen. Then submerge the tip
into ink (I recommend separating the ink from the bottle so you don't mix
inks!). As the body of the pen cools, it draws the ink into the body of the pen
through the tip. It doesn't completely refill it, but it does work. I used it
with a purple and had minimal color change, but this trick probably will not
work if you plan on using it for multiple ink colors. Still a cool discovery,
though."
richardpace,"March 19, 2014","I find the ink thin (grey), and the stroke scratchy and prone to gap during
quick lines.  I ordered two different Kuretake brush pens (this and the extra
fine) this order and both made similar strokes Not likely to try this pen or the brand again as a result."
liralenli,"February 4, 2010","This tip is softer than the xtra-fine, and shows good variation for small
written Chinese calligraphy. It's also perfect for putting pine needles on pine
trees with my ink paintings. Wide enough to show the right kinds of variation
for the needles, but thin enough to keep every needle sharp. I can watercolor
right over it and there's no smearing or bleed thru. It's perfect for what I'd
hoped to use it for.  I suspect this will also be quite good for the thicker outline lines for
manga-style drawing as well."
James,"February 28, 2014","I use this to outline my sketches and it really makes them pop! It is very easy

sammidodge,"January 28, 2018","I already owned this pen in a pink/champagne color. I loved the way it
writes--it's so smooth!--and the wonderful convenience of the ""vanishing point.""
But I didn't love the color. It's okay, but not really my taste. So, considering
how much I use and love the pen, I decided to purchase it in gray as well. I'm
so glad I did: it's perfect. The color is subtle yet beautiful. It writes
beautifully and feels great in the hand. Although both of my Decimos are fine
points, the gray one has a slightly broader stroke. That's fine with me.
Overall, I adore the Decimo and am so glad Jet Pens carries the gray color. "
scoots,"August 9, 2022","This pen is perfect for exactly what I bought it for—using with my Hobonichi
Techo planner. It's fine enough to write clearly in the paper's small grid size,
slim enough to fit easily in the cover's pen loop (my planner cover is a folding
one that keeps the pen protected, not the type that uses pen loops to hold it
closed), and the retractable nib makes it easy to reach for and put away at a
moment's notice. The nib is incredibly smooth and writes so well—I don't think
I've lost the sweet spot even once, and there's not a hint of scratchiness
despite how finely it writes. The weight is also great, light but still nice and
solid in the hand. I've heard that the CON-40 converter can be a big drawback,
since it has a small ink capacity and is difficult to fill completely, but it
doesn't come with the Decimo and I didn't bother getting one separately; I just
cleaned out the included cartridge and refilled it with bottled ink instead,
which was quick and easy and holds more ink anyway.From what I've seen Pilot's capless pens have a reputation of being perfect for
jotting down quick notes, and my Decimo definitely excels at that. I was hoping
that the lighter weight might also make it a good choice for long writing
sessions, but I've found its slender profile works against it during extended
use; I need a looser hold than I can get on the Decimo to be comfortable writing
at length. It's still a great all-purpose pen that can go anywhere and stays
comfortable for several minutes of writing, so I can't recommend it
enough—just be aware this pen may not be up to marathon sessions if that's
something you need rather than a nice bonus."

Jessiesova,"November 28, 2022","Almost 2 years later and still my favorite. The aluminum and finish are

:'( Sad day.The following day, my husband returned to the location of the accident,
searching for things that had flown out of my car and he found it! I figured it
was a lost cause, never to write again. I washed it up anyways. He oiled the
little hinge for the capless mechanism. I use it every day. It has one scuff
from its adventure. Also, comfortable, fine and smooth writing. So...10/10 "

john.hertel,"May 13, 2021","Great pen, arrived fast & perfect condition"
ltgargaz,"February 27, 2019","I received this pen today.  I like EVERYTHING about it -- the design, weight,
fit, finish, flexibility, service before and after the sale.  Assuming that
O-rings and refills will always be available, this pen should last for
generations.  The ad refers to the finish as ""stonewashed.""  It appears to me (a
retired Architect) that the finish is ""satin"" titanium, which was likely
achieved by ""bead-blasting"" the exterior surfaces.  The color is a soft, ""warm
gray"" and there is almost no ""reflection,"" which I prefer.  Visually, this pen
is ""understated"" and reminiscent of the utilitarian, tool-design, minimalist
movement.  The unadorned simplicity is something that you would find in the
Bauhaus movement.  There is no ""style"" and zero ornamentation.  Is this an
""everyday"" writing instrument?  Yes and no.  If you are constantly using the
pen, then you probably want a clicker so you aren't unscrewing the cap and
screwing it back on to use the pen.  If you use a pen infrequently, then you
should consider this classic.  For me, it's a keeper.  I appreciate great design
and this is a fine, versatile, instrument.  I also like the excellent
information I've received from ""Joe"" with BIGiDESIGN.  He's helpful and
knowledgeable.  The fact that this is a relatively new design and they have
already made incremental improvements with this latest model speaks well of the
business model of BIGiDESIGN.  I like this pen VERY much.  LTGAZ"
WriterQ,"February 28, 2020","The idea of having a pen that holds a huge variety of refills and makes other
pen bodies sounded brilliant. It is. I bought several different refills that
were recommended for the pen. --One of the recommended refills fell out of the pen during a meeting with a
potential client. Embarrassing. Luckily, I had another pen and waited for the
meeting to be over to crawl under the table to retrieve the slim refill.-- The cap posts, but you have to thread it on. And be careful, after just 10
days, the O-ring on the back already looks worn. --The one part I hate is that I have to tighten the front gripper part EVERY
time I use the pen. I don't know why it won't hold, but it's annoying. For the
price I paid, I find this a big defect. My Pentel Hybrid Technica is not nearly
as cool, but is far more dependable. And cheaper."
hroe,"January 12, 2020","Briefly:I really like this pen. The weighting and the functionality are excellent.One note: the pen gets *better* with a bit of use. When I first took it out of
the box and started using it I wasn't a huge fan. The surface texture in my hand
was a little 'off' for my preference. The cap didn't screw/unscrew smoothly from
either end of the pen. But about a week into using it the surface texture had
smoothed very slightly to feel much better. And, the screw/unscrew got much much
smoother to a lovely glide. So, I'm really happy with this pen and if you have some initial concerns like
what I describe, give it a chance. "
cbpete,"November 16, 2018","First, fast shipping and pen arrived early. Pen is exactly as pictured and
described. Nice weight, not too heavy and not to light. Haven’t found a refill
that will not fit. Solid construction and sturdy when cap screwed on in use and
not in use. Finish is fantastic. "
AlanRobertson,"October 15, 2018","The power-drill style of holding the pen's internals is ingenious--I have full
confidence in its ability to hold any of 750+ models of refill.  They say the
pen is mightier than the sword: with the right refill, and the right writer,
this pen could take on a nuclear weapon . . . and win."
ben_smith,"October 8, 2018","Pen is not heavy in my hand.  The cap doesn't screw on and off easily.  I think
that the natural texture of the titanium along with the ""brushed"" finish is what
makes it not glide very well.  I was going to put some silicon grease on the
threads to help, but decided within 10 minutes of playing with it that I had
wasted $90 and would not be using it.  I took the Pentel Energel Needle point
refill that I had tested in it out and put the pen in a box with all of my other
pens that I don't use.My biggest frustration was that the Uni-bal ""vision"" liquid ink refills don't
fit.  I later found the compatibility list, and so I blame myself for not doing
enough research before buying the pen.  I thought that to add just a couple more
mm's in diameter and the vision refills would have fit.  Actually I think that
just 1 more mm and they would have fit.  The Uni-bal liquid ink is so much
better that the gel ink refills that do fit.Pros  1.  light in weight, not heavy          2. took every refill of the uni-bal and energel refills (except the
vision liquid ink refills)          3.  comes with an excellent starter refill.  I really liked the dark
black ink, it was excellent           4.  engineering is amazing, and adaptation method really does work.          5.  bought the pen to survive all the times that I was going to drop
it, and looks as though it would not have               disappointed me had I decided to use it in my daily rotation.  A
few drops on hard surfaces and no problems noted.          6.  unlike the first version of this pen, you don't need a special
tool to disassemble the cap to adjust the clip, just a                             regular screw driver.          7.  comes with a few extra ""O"" rings in the box.Cons  1.  Cap is hard to screw off and on (see above comments).  Maybe this
would improve with time or silicon grease.                I don't know.           2.  Wish that this were a snap on and off cap for convenience.  I'm
an air traffic controller and I need to have                 quick access to the pen.  I don't have time to laboriously
screw off the cap.  As you can tell I was super frustrated                with the cap.  I don't know why.  Maybe I was having a bad ""cap""
day.           3.  Uni-bal vision liquid ink refills don't fit  ugggghhhhhhhhhhhh
(see above comments).Suggestions:  1.  Make an oversized version that's just a mm or two wider in
diameter so these Uni-bal vision liquid ink                            refills would fit (I like them so much because the
ink is the smooth flowing liquid Super-Ink.  Unfortunately                             the EnerGel fraud proof pens don't flow as well and
the ink colors are not very dark and look washed out                             compared to the uni-bal liquid ink Super-Ink
colors.)                        2.  Make a snap on/off cap.  I guess a retractable
version would resolve this problem as well, but I don't                            like to carry RTs in my pocket due to possible
stains.Conclusion:  Pen is exactly what it says it is, and does it extremely well.  I
only deduct one star for the difficulty in screwing the cap on or off.  Other
than that, the pen is perfect for what it is intended to be used for:  a
stealthy Ninja assault pen used for writing silly comments on the forehead of
your family and friends while they are sleeping.  "
ijuggle4life,"June 2, 2020","The concept alone for this pen deserves 5 stars. I wish the TI Ultra wasn't as

that one of the prongs in the cam mechanism is bent. It doesn't take away from
the functionality or the aesthetics when a cartridge is installed but for the
cost and from a company who prides themselves in their product, i am surprised
this made it past quality control."

mechanisms are more quickly deployed, so maybe get the Arto EDC for variety of

Zackadoom,"March 2, 2022","I LOVE the concept of this pen.  Truth be told, I haven't yet found a refill
that doesn't work with it.  Now, as to why it gets only four stars.  Its overall size and weight.I expected it to be a little longer and fatter.  The length isn't a big deal.  I
have shorter pens, but the ""chubbiness,"" I would have preferred it to be
chubbier.  I like a thicker pen.  It's light, but posted, I feel that it is weighted oddly.  I don't feel its
center of gravity at the center.Do I regret this pen?  NO.  it looks awesome and an pretty much take ANY refill
that I use.  It writes well and the clip is TOIGHT and won't fall out of your
pocket/notebook pen holder, etc.  I WOULD have given it 4.5 stars if that were
possible.I KNOW its pricey, but I still like this pen a lot.  If you have 90isn dollars
to play with, go ahead and give it a try."

klongcrow,"December 9, 2021","Excellent and balanced. may be a little heavy for some but is a nice writing
experience."
Zack W,"February 25, 2021","I've been using this pen for about a year now and I am pleased enough that I
hope to buy the Ultra one day when I feel comfortable paying the tall price tag
to get it. Things to note about this pen, it is not a pen made for pen
enthusiasts who like fancy pens. This is NOT a fancy pen. It will probably not
feel great in your hands if you don't use it regularly. If you aren't used to
using tools, you may have trouble with the cinching mechanism. If you don't
""back into"" the threading which you should be doing with any screw on pen top,
you will likely strip it. This is a pen for people who like working with their
hands, enjoy how tools work, look, and feel, AND are either very picky about
their refills, or simply want to be able to use the same pen consistently
regardless of what pen refill they have lying around. It has a great weight, but
is a little short in the hand when the cap isn't posted regardless of refill. If
you see this pen and think it looks neat, cool, durable, etc and like the fact
that it is Titanium, you will probably indeed like this pen. If you don't know
where to buy replacement o-rings for when the o-rings which come on this pen
need to be replaced, most hardware stores will have them for you."
mellentine,"February 6, 2019","Great feel, perfect weight.  I was a little concerned about the overall length,
however after a month of using it, it's pefect for using at sit down meetings,
standing Tier meetings, walking the production floor, etc.  "
Tansy,"December 26, 2019","The EnerGel ink is my favorite for everyday writing because it doesn't smear
under my hand (not a lefty, but I manage to smear Pilot G-2s) and the needle
point is precise. This pen is the same as the EnerGel RTX but with a cuter body.
I usually use a black 0.3 RTX in my planner (Kokuyo Jibun Techo), but if you
like a slightly thicker line this is a nice, unusual thickness. I like that the
ink color is readable as brown, and not brown-black or reddish. "

don’t notice at all. Overall this is a really good pen :)"

stvn,"May 14, 2020","This pen is great! The Ahab & Neponset were my previous go-to’s for getting
flex/line variation, but this pen brings that to a whole new level. If the
Ahab’s line range is approx. F/M => B, I’d estimate this as M/B => BBBB! You
def need Rhodia-quality (or above) paper to handle the amt of ink it puts down.With Noodler’s pens, you kinda have to know what you’re doing, or you’re
gonna have a bad time. And sometimes you have to tinker around a bit, adjusting
the nib/feed, and testing different inks for flow to get them to where you want
them. I have a few Noodler’s pens now, and usually the first thing I do is
widen the feed channel(s) with a craft knife, and then adjust the nib & tines a
little, before heat-setting them.I did some minor tweaking on the Triple Tail when I got it, and now I can get
some pretty mind-bending flex... So far I’ve gotten the best results while
using wetter Noodler’s & Robert Oster inks. Sometimes you just gotta get under
the hood with these pens, but it’s well worth it (and you can learn a lot
about fountain pens in the process!)."
MWoolsey,"March 9, 2020","Still has the fairly strong resin smell.  Hard to keep the pen flowing, either
dries up or dumps copious amounts of ink at start. Its like the ink doesn't
spread equally between the 3 tines.  While the nib is exotic looking I should
have spent the money elsewhere.  I used Noodles nightshade ink in this pen. 
This is my 4th Noodler brand pen."
a2price,"March 18, 2020","Looked forward to using a flexible nib pen and the creative writing
possibilities. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. The pen skips, the ink
clogs. I am unable to find a writing angle that gives a consistent flow of ink.
I do not recommend this pen. Buy with caution as an inked pen cannot be
returned."
skunkmountain,"May 11, 2020","I listened to Nathan of Noodler's tell a long story about the triple tail shark
this pen is named after and wanted one ever since.  The pen feels nice in my
hand, is wonderfully clear to highlight the color of the ink in the barrel, and
the nib/feed is fabulously wet.  I am not enough of a writer to show off the
full extent of the nib's flex abilities, but I can a bit, and it makes even my
handwriting more interesting. "
lunapuella,"May 11, 2020","i have read alot of bad reviews of this pen but i just love it. yes it is inky
but its curves and flex are just what i wanted and damn affordable."
QuantumTea,"April 23, 2021","Love how this brings out the shading in inks! I pushed the feed in a little to
slow the ink flow and used R+K Alt Goldgren (after a failed attempt with
Platinum Citrus Black, too dry of an ink).There is a strong smell to the resin, less after a day out of the packaging. The
section is hourglass-shaped and comfortable in my hand. It's a BIG pen, but
feels good, light and easy to use. Still experimenting with writing angle for
best flex, but out of the box this was the least finicky Noodler's pen I've ever
used (at least my 5th)"
desorgo,"March 10, 2022","Update - it looks like I was wrong about this nib, and apologies to Renee at
JetPens who was super responsive in helping me figure out how to get this pen
working. I cleaned it (which many people recommend before inking it), reset the
nib/feed slightly further apart and less deep (I needed it to be drier and more
controllable as it was dripping ink), heat set it (there are great videos out
there on how to do this), put a little silicone grease on the threads, and now
it writes and flexes beautifully. It takes some tinkering, but the end result is
worth it. "
ispeight,"December 19, 2021","I cannot give a five star as I am of the opinion I have a faulty product.I cannot be certain it is the product. I might not understand how to fill it

and theInk is getting all into the section. I did try disassembly and reassembly
several timeswith no joy. So I writing off, ha-ha, this purchase as a loss."
cordfish,"July 24, 2022","It's fine, but the flow isn't great and doesn't come in the middle of a printed
word. Not worth the $$."
samdenham8,"February 26, 2022","Nathan Tardiff is far better at confecting ink than in precision pen
manufacturing. (My Ahab pen was unusable.)That said, the Triple Tail has better fit and finish. With well-behaved inks
like Pilot Iroshizuku, it lays down a fabulous wet line that shades
magnificently on my last sheets of Tomoe River paper.Will soon try it with Sailor Sakura, a delicate cherry blossom ink, then with a
monster sheener, Vinta Blue Blood."
katimus.prime,"November 28, 2022","As with most Noodler's products, there is an odor in this one, and I have to
press harder than I'd like to make it flex, but it does write very gorgeously
and handles shimmer inks well."
yishanwangcmu,"August 27, 2022","Least smelly of Noodler's pens. This is my first flex pen but it's pretty
friendly for beginners and the nib flexes well once I got the hang of it. I
would recommend inks that flow well (rather than a thick ink like Sailor storia)
in order to avoid seeing sudden blobs down the nib as you flex. Really happy
about this purchase!"
nater8546,"July 2, 2022","Perfect First Pen! I have had no issues with this pen have used it for months. I
was originally hesitant due to the other reviews but I have had no trouble. It
writes beautifully, shows a lot of character, and has some insane line
variation.Its filling mechanism is better than any other I've used and in just two pumps,
it's full."
KAlice,"June 17, 2022","It has a flow problem. If you press down for a thicker line (the whole point of
the pen) there isn't enough ink and I end up with 2 small parallel lines
instead, not even 3 like there should be. the third tine never seems to have ink
on it."
desorgo,"March 9, 2022","My Triple Tail arrived with an unfortunate flaw - the nib has a significant bend
upward from the feed. As a result, it uncontrollably spilled ink on the page.
JetPens was not great as far as addressing the issue, I'm afraid. So I spent $55
on a pen that's useless. "
Kozmo18,"February 15, 2022","This is my least favorite pen because it frequently has a problem with hard
starts. When working properly, it does put down a good flow of ink and responds

ljuarez416,"March 12, 2020","This pen is great! I switched out the ink for a ohtoBlack ink which works perfectly. I took a star when i noticed the black paint on

I don’t mind it too much but for a pen that cost as much as this one does, I
would of expected better resistance to this issue."
jackson.gabriel,"March 12, 2020","The pen body itself is great - heavy for it's size and the knurling makes it

insert is not. "
Rob Whitnell,"June 27, 2018","This pen is great! Exceedingly well constructed with a very nice twist mechanism
for extending and retracting the tip. The provided Rotring refill writes well
for me (but I’m not the pickiest writer). My first generation Rotring 600

doesn't have the same heft, it’s a worthy, solid, successor. "

the shipped cartridge, as I went straight to the included converter and my
preferred Noodler's inks.  I'd probably better buy some more: when something is
this good Murhpy's Law guarantees the manufacturer will discontinue it.  "
ceeb,"March 12, 2019","Honestly of all of the fountain pens I picked up recently between the Lamy
safari, Lx, and Al-Stars, TWSBIs, this one was my favorite. It's not as pretty
in my opinion, but it felt the nicest in the hand, the weight was beautiful, and
it wrote the most beautifully, especially for such a fine nib. I keep it loaded
with pigment based/lightfast inks for artwork and sketchbooking, and it has had
zero issues with inkflow and clogging, and maintains a nice and fine line
economy with even the wettest inks. Easily the starter-mid range fountain pen
I'd recommend the most, which is great, since it's also much kinder in price!"
Crownme02,"August 18, 2015","This was my first fountain pen! The packaging was beautiful as it came in it's
own case and I still use the case today. The body is nicely weighted, grip is
good, its writes to nicely. This was a great fountain pen to start with and I've
since bought other ones with a different body shape. Love the color as well. "
chirmer,"July 19, 2016","Great but fragile. The pen wrote incredibly smoothly for the week I had it. It feels solid in the
hand, comfortable to hold, and is a gorgeous color. But it's incredibly,
INCREDIBLY fragile. It fell, capped, from my Midori pen loop as I was bending
over (I'm short, so it was only about a 3 ft. drop) and it hit on the back end.
The cap flew off, the pen bounced on the hard floor back and forth, spurting ink
and bending the nib. I bent the nib back as best I could and it writes, just not
as well as it did.I don't expect my pens to be super durable - they're fountain pens. But I do
really feel like after such a short fall, the cap should have stayed on to
protect the nib. I expected it to be dinged up or dented, but I didn't expect
the nib to be destroyed after such a small incident. If you are looking for a
pen for EDC, I would pass on this one and go with a LAMY. Those are
indestructable - this one is absolutely not."
Pendragon,"October 23, 2015","Bought this based on the reviews. You'd think a cheap pen couldn't do it. But I
believe because it was made by Pilot. It was my second fountain pen and it
OUTRANKS the Lamy Joy I had. EXCELLENT for daily use, the ink lasts quite a
while, doesn't skip, flows well (so be careful on the nib else you'll have very
inky hands). The kind I had was medium nib and it was black with zig zag
pattern. Doesn't matter the design tho, they're fairly pleasing to look at.
Altho I think they could be a bit more masculine, they're fine for both genders'
tastes. I've dropped it many times, and the outer part hardly gets scratched.
BUY IT. <3"

the only small negative is the industrial look of the regular clear demo. Well
this Prussian blue and the recent black and gold edition are just stunning.
Personally I like all their nibs but if you want to add some flair to your
writing go for the Stub 1.1. By far my favorite stub fountain pen in all
category. Get them while you can."
MdgColorado,"August 28, 2020","I've been writing with a base 580 for almost 4 years (and 2 ECO's besides). The
580's size and balance have been ideal for my hand, but it always looked like a
collection of disparate, competing elements with too much chrome. This 580ALR,
with the cool blue pieces, somehow looks much better. Out of the box, the stub nib was missing starts pretty often. 60 seconds with
micro-mesh cured that and smoothed it out to a really nice writing feel. Knowing
TWSBI's reputation for customer service, I am confident they would have taken
care of the hard start problem but I was able to do it myself in no time. "
JDES,"January 18, 2022","This is a beautiful, well made pen.  I purchased this to use with Emerald de
Chivor.  I've experimented with various nibs for this ink and thought I'd try a
TWSBI stub.  This pen puts down so much ink that the lines were very dark and
lost most of that Chivor pop we all love.  I used it on my Rhodia paper so this
wasn't tested on cheap copy paper.  The TWSBI stub may be a good choice for
Apache Sunset but didn't work for my purposes."
kathrynammonstiles,"August 10, 2022","My 4th TWSBI and my first stub nib. I love this pen but have one minor complaint
that may be just due to my own issues! The grip area near the nib is metal, with
the pretty blue color, and has tiny grooves in it the circle the grip. For some
reason this can cause me to get a little bit of a spin on the pen while I am
writing. It may be due to my struggle to find the best paper match for this nib.
My Moleskin and Leuchtturm 1917 did not work well with this nib so I was
gripping harder perhaps? It works wonderful with CD, Tomoe River, Pilot, Life
Noble and any other Japanese fountain pen paper product that I have tried thus
far. I love the pen in every other way and it still deserves 5 stars because of
the gorgeous reliability of the pen and it's amazing ink capacity. Love the
Piston Fill and the overall design. All of my TWSBIs are wonderful. "

Terri P,"March 15, 2021","Nice, sturdy, well-built pen. The stub nib is a beautiful writer that adds some

randallgsullivanmsmd,"October 4, 2021",No problems.  Arrived promptly 
Lyric Thompson,"June 14, 2021","So far so good, writes really well and the nibs swap easily (currently using a
broad). I'm very fond of TWSBI's stub nibs in general. Mine is a very wet writer
with the inks I have put in it so far. Doesn't post well, but it's big enough
you really don't want to, and to be honest if you have enough patience it can
sort of be posted just not really recommended. I really really like using
Emerald of Chivor in mine since you can take apart the nib assembly, I like it
for shimmer inks personally. The one thing I really prefer about the Eco over
this is the case it comes in, the case of the Diamond 580 is more like a display
stand, which is still neat just not really my thing."
Nekona,"June 2, 2021","A friend recommended the TWSBI stub nib to me and I am so glad he did. This has
become my new favorite fountain pen. It works amazing with inks, feels very
solid in my hand, and is easy to fill. The weight and the nib really help to
make my usually poor handwriting look like something special despite my
neurological hand tremor. "
tmoehn,"May 27, 2021","The way this feels in my hand is well balances and so natural.  I ordered the De

AC MD,"April 7, 2017","As a left-handed medical student I've struggled to find a dependable pen that
writes well and dries quickly enough that my notes don't smear. Needless to say,
I'm no longer looking. This pen has all of the positive qualities of the Zebra Sarasa Push Clip Gel Pen
family and the added bonus of rapid drying. The grip is comfortable enough to
last 8+ hour study sessions and the 0.5mm tip flows nicely across glossy and
normal paper. Most importantly, it is the ONLY PEN available that won't smear my
notes in First Aid.Very satisfied with my repeated purchases of this pen."
chlo studies,"July 28, 2017","The Sarasa Dry stays true to its word. No smearing at all! However, the ink does
skip quite often, and the tip size is much bigger than other normal 0.5 pens

in 0.7."
morgen,"June 27, 2017","It definitely dries very fast and you can highlight it immediately, which is
exactly what it says it'll do.However the the ink is a strange texture (because it dries so fast) which

unusable by any standard."

pen in my case. As a student who hand writes notes, these are by far the best
pens for note-taking I've ever used. The ink flow is excellent, almost like a
rollerball but without the scratchiness, perfect for writing quickly. The ink is
very dark and has great contrast against bright white paper. Paired with a
thick, smooth paper like Kokuyo Campus paper, it dries extremely quickly in
comparison to most inks and you can highlight over it even with zebra mildliners
without smudging. It doesn't perform as well on thinner or scratchier paper, it
might bleed through or look less smooth. I have other pens to suit that need, so
that's alright with me. "

an almost invisible faint blue skinny line. I will stick with the regular sarasa

med student,"August 3, 2018","FINALLY! I write mostly in an extra large, ruled moleskine notebook for medical
school. I had tried a lot of different pens before this one (energel, sarasa
clip, pilot, uniball signo) in a lot of different sizes (from 0.3 to 0.7). Every
single one of those pens was either too scratchy or did not dry fully and
therefore kept causing smears on my notebook. I'm right handed but I hold my hand in a weird way so that my hand actually
rests above whatever I am writing. So when I'm writing in my notebook, I place
my hand on whatever I've just immediately written as I move down to the next
line of writing. The ink would ALWAYS get smeared all over my right hand and
it's been like this my entire life. I just never really cared too much until I
actually started to need these notes much more now that I'm in med school. So I finally ordered these sarasa dry gel pens in a .4mm and a .5mm and they
both dry instantly in my moleskine notebook. I can immediately set my hand on
what i've just written and it does not pick up or smudge at all. I saw in these
reviews that one person commented they were having the same issue with this pen
that I was having with other pens. But that is not the case for me at all! These
pens completely solved my problems. This is officially the only pen I will ever
purchase again. Side note, I do prefer the .4mm to the .5mm. The .4mm is not scratchy at all and
writes about the same thickness line as my .5 energel. I don't know why people
are saying the .4mm is scratchy, because it isn't. However, my energel .3mm was
very scratchy which is why I ditched it (just for comparison). The .5mm is a little thick for me. It writes more like a pilot g2 .7mm in my
opinion. So if you like a nice thick line, go with that one.Again, this is hands down the best pen (.4mm in my case though. I just happened
to order them at the same time to test both. I love both pens but just prefer a
smaller line) for what I need. I will never be ordering any other type of pen ever again! "
Mpreid,"July 20, 2018","While this pen writes a little ""thick"" in terms of the average 0.5 pen, the
darkness of the black and the quick dry time has me coming back here to buy
refill after refill. Highly recommend for any lefty!"
Heyy,"July 11, 2018","I got this pen for college since I take fast notes I need the ink to dry really
fast. This pen does dry really quickly, but using a highlighter will smear the
ink pretty bad. I can't use the pen if I can't use a highlighter with it."
desiree.may,"June 28, 2018","I bought this pen because I heard it was a great option for left-handed people.
Well, its not bad. Some pros include the fact that it dries really fast (like
realllly fast) so there's no way you'd smudge anything. The ink also flows out
smoothly, and it's very dark (If you're looking for something that won't be seen
on the back side of the paper, this isn't it). Some cons: after a while (left
handed people know this all to well) the pen stops working properly. By that I
mean the ink won't come out and you'll have to write over and over again until
the ink finally comes out. The only way to fix this is to hold the pen in your
hand in an angle that a right handed person would. And that's really
uncomfortable, unless you've been doing that for a long time. TL;DR: If you're left-handed this pen won't fix all the issues that comes with
using a pen. If you're right-handed buy this pen, it's wonderful."

jelenko,"May 16, 2018","Leaves a nice, solid line.  But, writes a little scratchy."
Allison,"April 15, 2018","I'm a lefty, so I'm always on the lookout for pens that dry quickly. The ink in
this pen dries almost instantly and doesn't smear. It's also well-made,
comfortable to hold, and puts down a nice dark line.However, I'm running into issues working in a Moleskine notebook -- even after
the ink has been dry for days, resting your hand on top of your writing will
lift up some of the ink from the page. So, while the ink doesn't smear, it does
create these faint gray smudges over your words where the ink on your hand
transfers back to the page.This has only happened so far in my Moleskine notebook. More absorbent papers
don't seem to have this problem, so in standard composition notebooks and
cheaper journals, this pen works as advertised. Since Molskine is a pretty
popular notebook brand, though, the lifting problem is worth mentioning.  "
viviantndoan,"March 26, 2018","The lines seemed bigger than .5, it did dry quickly but it wasn't worth it for
me "
sam.hill7,"March 23, 2018",Nice thick inky line. Good action 
psprudnikov3,"February 25, 2018","The fastest drying ink formula I know. Dries as fast as Pentel Energel does. Has
the same problem with pale color on correction tape. Ink feathers on cheap
paper."
autties.r,"February 1, 2018","It’s good, but I.T feels like a 0.7 not .5"
pcraythorne,"January 16, 2018","My new favorite pen. Best pen I’ve ever used (I’m leftie). Highly recommend
to all lefties and anyone else who wants a great pen. "
Rebecca C,"January 8, 2018","It really does not smear. This pen is smooth and cool looking. It is also
comparable to the Pentel Energel X needle point, which I also purchased. They
are both great and I will be using them for different things."
Markl,"November 14, 2017","Great pen. Very comfortable grip. Consistent, pigmented, fast drying ink.
Comfortable grip. Smooth writing and no skipping ever"
stevenso,"March 27, 2017","Nice grip on this quick-drying gel pen.  I have small hands and find it
difficult to find comfortable pen grips -- this one works well.  Overall, the
pen seems a bit too light for comfortable balance in the long run, but it is
comfortable on short writing jobs."
nickie,"March 24, 2017","I'm a leftie and these Sarasa Dry pens are aMAZing! They don't skip or blob or
scratch. They dry incredibly fast, and everyone who tries them are ""jell-ous""
;-)I have just come to the end of my first one with the black body, so now I will
get some with the pink and the blue bodies.I love the black ink and it is just the right line for my purposes."
mike,"March 8, 2017","NEW FAVORITE PEN! The ink is so BLACK, and it's so smooth to write with I prefer
it over my fountain pens. I burn through a Coleto refill in under a day, but the
Sarasa refill lasts me over a week, nearly two. And the pen clip is on a spring
so I don't snap it off like I do every other pen. I've ordered a bunch of these
now so I can keep one everywhere I need to write. Try it, you will not be
disappointed."
JapanFan,"February 5, 2017",Best Gel Pen period. Smooth and light. 
anna.machavariani,"February 1, 2017","I LOVE this pen, perfect for those who want bold color. Dries really quickly."
codefortress,"August 22, 2021","I like these pens, but the sticker leaves adhesive when removed. I attempted to
remove the adhesive with alcohol, but was not successful. This is unacceptable,
since other companies have figured this out, and use stickers which remove
cleanly. I realize this may not be a issue for others, but I hate writing with
sticky pen. "
egret23,"April 4, 2019","I bought the 0.5 size and it writes like a 0.7. I emailed JetPens to confirm
this was correct and they said it was. I wish they would put that in the product
description as I’ve wasted money on a pen I don’t use. "
aprilalieda,"March 9, 2017","The pens are great but they confirmed what I thought was true - I am not a fine
point gal. I need a medium point at least. This is a user issue, not a pen issue
so I gave 5 stars. Also purple. You can't go wrong with purple."
davis_jessi,"January 14, 2017","I love them. I would definitely recommend the gel pen sampler. Great way to
determine which gel pens you truly love. "
MiscMarilyn,"December 28, 2016","I love purple pens and gel pens so this was made for me. I had tried pilot juice
before but not the other brands. It helps to use pens to know if I like it or
not so this gives a great variety to use and figure out which are my favorites! "
PenGal,"March 11, 2017","I love the color and the way each one writes differently. I just don't like the
ones with the .3mm point. It scratches the paper if you write too fast."
kathleen.krucoff,"March 10, 2017","I LOVE purple. These are a great way to try a vey nice variety of pens in my
favorite color. Happy with each one I've tried so far. "
Simone,"February 18, 2019","I bought this set of pens as a Christmas gift for my mom who loves stationery.
She absolutely loved all the pens! I tried them out as well and every single one
is great quality. These JetPens Pen Samplers are some of my favorite items
offered here. They're great if you're a stationery or pen lover and want to try
out a bunch of cool new pens. The pens included are diverse so you get a good
taste of numerous brands, inks, barrels, etc. I'd definitely recommend this to
anyone who is addicted to pens! :)"
Pretty but fades,"March 8, 2018","I'm an attorney and have lots of transcripts that are printed two pages on one
sheet of paper, so the font is very small, and double-sided (to save paper &
it's lighter to carry around). I really liked this pack for taking notes on the
transcripts because 1) purple stands out against black ink but is still dark and
not too harsh on the eyes; 2) gel pens don't bleed through; 3) most of the pens
in this pack are very fine and allow me to write in the tiny spaces between the
printed lines. I really liked the Pilot Hi-Tec C Maica, because I like capped pens, and when
posted, it's a nice length (longest of the bunch!), but a bit too
""nonprofessional"" looking for court. As someone who often makes mistakes when I
hand write things, I also have a soft spot for any Frixion pens. You also can't
go wrong with the classic Uniball Signos, but the one in lavender black didn't
stand out enough against black ink for my purposes. My least favorite was the
regular Pilot Hi-Tec C, which, being the thinnest grip-less pen in this pack, I
found uncomfortable to hold."
elippman,"July 8, 2021",Wonderful variety to use in my daily journaling
m.morris404,"December 18, 2020","There were a lot of 0.5mm and some 0.3mm pen, but I prefer 0.7mm pen. I loved
the variety of colors and found d a few pens I love and want to buy more of in
other colors. I loved the Lavender  Black!"
writingdiva5,"April 26, 2019","My first sampler set, but definitely not my last. So far the stand out pens for
me are the Uni-ball Signo DX in lavender black which is both professional yet
edgy, the Pentel EnerGel X which just skates over paper, and the Hi-Tec-C maica
which is the smoothest fine tip I've written with in ages. I'm really pleased
with the quality and the fun little comic printed at the bottom of the shipping
invoice. "
kucharek412356,"March 29, 2019","Really happy with this order! My first time shopping at Jetpens. Loved this
sample kit. I liked 8/10 of the pens. "
mjcheung,"November 17, 2018","This set let me fine tune my choices to my very specific needs -- editing typed
copy and being able to write legibly between the lines with a smooth flow
because there's very little room for globs or crossing out. I chose another for
a different writing purpose. I also walked a friend through the process who
needs a bold low smear pen. I recommend this process. "
mooska2185,"April 10, 2018","All of the pens are great! Having the sampler option is such a fun thing. I love
being able to try new pens in my favorite colors. I will be buying some sets of
a couple types. "
TOKYOKIE,"December 24, 2017","Bought this for a friend that likes purple. Would be better if it came in a cute
case"
register,"March 9, 2017","It was fun to get the pens, of course!  So I'm not sorry I got it.  But none of
them wound up being in my collection of treasured ""boy I love to write with this
pen"" pens."
Shoshana,"March 9, 2017","Love, love, LOVE this set! Of course the color is awesome but I really like the
fact that there are so many different brands and styles included. This way I can
try a bunch of new ones I probably wouldn't have picked myself, plus I don't
have to spend a bunch of time picking them out. Awesome!"
heather,"December 21, 2022",about half the pens didn't work or are very VERY fine so they barely write.
snowpuppies,"February 9, 2021","PAY ATTENTION While the quality of pens was good, they are almost all a fine or smaller tip,
which are those 0.5mm and below. Out of TEN pens, there are only TWO that have a
medium point. Below the item is a listing of all the pens included, which means
this is on me that I didn’t get what I expect.  Still, I did get to try
several and now have an idea of which ones I might like in a larger tip size,
although it was an expensive way to find out. Four stars because they are good
quality, but for a “sampler” I think I’d have at least one in a bold size,
with the majority falling in the fine-medium range  (3/10 in this set). 
Overall, I’m just kinda sad. "
tatalinieykaleneedra,"October 29, 2020",Excellent quality and variety. 
DEBRAJWOOD,"June 1, 2020","These purple pens are awesome, I'm not sure which one is my favorite but I use

love it! "
sjbroadwell7,"May 12, 2020",Pens are good quality and give a few different shades of purple to write in.
andrea.felder,"April 14, 2020","Overall I love them!  There are a couple that I've given away because they
weren't the right 'feel' for me, but the rest are fantastic!  Great variations
of style and shades of purple.  Very happy with my purchase, will order my
favorites individually and would definitely try another color set!"

sarahgstallings,"February 12, 2018","I love all of these pens. I am a fan of them all being the same color and
different widths. I would add a few more thick options to this pack, but other
than that they are so great and fun!"
Megan Rex,"February 1, 2018","My husband bought this for me (along with some of his personal favorite pens for
himself) so that I could test out a variety of pens in my favorite color ink. I
love this set! I'm so glad to have this sampler; I've noticed my least favorite
pens tend to be favorites for others and vice versa. While I'm still taking most
of them for a longer test drive, first impression leaves me with the Pilot
Frixion Ball Knock in 0.5mm as my favorite. It's been perfect for taking notes
for classes as well as jotting down assignments in my planner, and I enjoy the
option of erasing if a deadline changes or I make a mistake. I've also been
really enjoying the Uni-Ball Signo UM-151 in Lavender Black - the dark ink is
beautiful and it flows so smoothly! My least favorite has been the Pilot
Hi-Tec-C Maica, while it's my husband's all-time favorite pen; mine just seems
to skip an awful lot while writing. Overall, I would absolutely recommend the
samplers to others, and am planning to purchase other samples as well as some
favorites!"

stationeryangel,"January 24, 2018","The Jetpens samplers are so fun!Purple is my absolutely favourite colour so I was thrilled to find colour
specific sample bundles. Its just a great idea! However, I do not like the fact
you cannot choose the size specifications for these pens. I cannot write with
extreme fine pens, thus there are at least two out of this bundle that I cannot
stand to write with. As a consequence I can't compare the extremely fine tip
pens with the others. Im stuck wondering if I'd like it more in the larger size.

they were shipped to my house I gave them a little trial.  All I can say is WOW!
 Purple is not my color but the pens wrote so well.  The tips on several were
tiny which is great for the way I write and draw but the larger tips worked well
too and may pull me down that path eventually.  The Purple Gel Pen Sampler is
definitely worth the price."

mandre1108,"February 23, 2017","I could not resist this sampler of purple pens and I'm enjoying trying them all
out. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is that most of them are a
finer tip than I prefer, but that's just me. Still a fun set, highly
recommended."
fire-fox,"February 3, 2017","Just got this sampler of pens and really not a fan of all of the pens. Out of
the ten pens I find that two are really good to write with, three are not really
not at all good and the rest were fine. The three that I really do not like at
all are Zebra Sarasa 0.3, Pilot Juice .38 and the Sakura Ballsign Knock 0.4;
They really did not feel comfortable when I write with them. The two that I like
are the Pentel Energel X 0.7 and the Uni-ball Signo DX .38 nice feel the ink
color is good not great but at least they did not fall in the rest of the pen
pile like the rest of the sampler did all in all ok but will stick with my
Fountain Pen for the important paper work that needs to be sign."

betkshew 71,"June 14, 2020","Not to sound trite, I love these pens.  It took me awhile to learn what a light
touch is required.  One or two pens in the set seemed to have drier ink, so I
would push harder.  I discovered that occasionally if I wipe the tips, it is a
gentle pressure that works.  Bearing down on them scratches the paper I think
and causes tiny bits of lint to adhere to the ball tips.  Easy does it!!"

i was able to write with alllll of them. im usually a 0.7 writer but these 0.5's
are so smoooooth and nice to write with. colors are solid and the variety is
superb.  i think i'm missing one though. i only count 27 swatches. if its my mistake then

them for my bullet journal if I use black paper."
Drewskaya,"December 2, 2020","As far as performance, you know what you're getting with Zebra Sarasa ink. It's
quick flowing, smooth writing, and fast drying (which is important to a lefty

the thicker line."

scratchy, and others, like the white gel pen or the lightest blue, just don't

wonderful though, and the push clip is amazing! I will repurchase some of these
colors, but the rest I have barely touched."

garys221,"September 29, 2017","Not sure why my favorite ink color has become brown lately... I've bought
several brown ink pens from JetPens over the last year but I've been frustrated
with their search algorithm. When looking for pens by ink color you often get
spurious results making it hard to find just the pens you're interested in. So
when I ran across this collection of brown ink pens I had to buy it.The collection has a number of pens that I have never seen when doing previous
searches for pens by ink color. Several of the pens have very fine tips and I
will be interested to see how they hold up over time.I will be writing reviews for the individual pens on their sales page when I
have had time to use them.If you're interested in evaluating a number of pens I strongly encourage the
purchase of the collections offered by JetPens."
mattnelson,"July 29, 2017","I received two-thirds of this order due to postal neglect and JetPens was swift
to remedy the situation. Thank you very much! As for the sampler itself, I like
using browns in my drawings and watercolor paintings, and this set is very fun
to explore. Decent variety of tones, ink quality, and line widths. "
femmith,"August 14, 2018","What a great idea to put a sampler of all these pens together! I love the
variety, the different shades of the color, and the different feel of the pen
tips. Now I know which ones I'd like more of."
prosopopoeia,"May 16, 2018","The various shades of brown in this sampler are wonderful. Some nibs are
narrower than I'd like, and a couple are fatter than I'd like, but that's the
point of a sampler! Very glad I purchased, helps to fine-tune future pen
purchases."
Sparrow,"April 15, 2018","Very pleased with assorted fine tip browns. Already own a couple of the brands,
but this is an excellent sampler of different brands, I've hesitated purchasing.
Shipping was fast, no frills and secure - no nonsense, just great service."
BugRabbit,"November 14, 2019","The pens are nice, although I was disappointed to find 95% of them are fine or
micro tip.  I prefer medium point."
okvenice,"August 2, 2019","I liked some of these pens better than others. My favorites were the Hi-Tech C,
Juice 0.5,Juice 0.38 and Sasara 0.5. The Pilot Hi-Tech C had a nice warm brown; the Juice
0.5 was almost an orange brown."

missamandaeaston,"May 14, 2020","I love pens with brown ink but these pens are terrible for journaling. Really
hard to write fluidly with. You need to be able to write quickly when you are
journaling. It’s stream of consciousness. You should not have to focus on
getting the pen to write. Way too fine a point. Wishing I had not spent the
money."

juicy Uniball Signo. Experiencing this vintage sepia look I think I will stay
with brown ink for very long time. Thank you for introducing it to me!!!!"

firefly,"March 31, 2017","I use gel pens for artwork on black paper and these are by far the thinnest and
most vibrant (of the thin pens out there).  I have the metallic set and this
pastel set.  They are both worth it.  I find the white pastel is a bit finicky,
but even that is worth it because the line is just so thin.     I'm very happy
with this purchase.  I also want to note that I reached out to Jet Pens for
advice on the thinnest and best gel pens to use on black paper for art work
purposes and they got back to me so quickly and with so much detail and
information that I was able to put in my order within a few hours.  I am so
pleased with the customer service and depth of information Jet Pens shares about
their products.  "
hellooomary,"December 3, 2017","these are absolute perfection, they write so smooth and the colors are so

it being very handy for someone who uses pens more artistically. "
rxntrs,"February 20, 2017","So far, so good. The pink can be a bit tricky to flow smoothly while writing,

Gracianne,"November 8, 2019","Great pens in color variety, tip, and ink flow.Keep in mind if you do purchase these, they aren't that visible with white paper
and considering the small tip size. If you plan to use these for everyday use,
on white paper, I recommend buying a set with darker colors."
Anonymous,"July 1, 2019","I was drawn to the clean design of these pens and after writing with them, they
did not disappoint! The ink flows smoothly and consistently. They also show up
on darker paper, but note that the ink isn't the most opaque compared to, say,
the Sakura Gellyrolls. Nonetheless, you get a nice selection of pastel colors
that aren't too hard to read."
notebook.wizard,"May 13, 2019","Confession: I almost never use pastels. I love bold, dark colors. However, there
are times when I need a different color or shade, so having a reliable pastel
set around is always useful. Pilot is and remains my favorite and most trusted
pen manufacturer, and this set has proven my loyalty has gone to the right
place. Smooth - Juice Up pens are SO incredibly smooth to write with. As good as
some of the Ohto pens! These fine point pastels have great color, dry fast, with very little bleed or
ghosting. They don't dry out if I don't use them for a bit, making them a great
set to have with me for that moment when a different color becomes necessary. "
kavyn.cox,"January 12, 2023","I am a sucker for a fine point pen. I love these pens. I have had an issue with

Sumabokemo,"October 7, 2018","I was so hopeful after reading all the glowing reviews, but I was very
disappointed. I'm a lefty and have yet to find a gel pen that writes smooth and

friend to try them. She loved them, bought them from me and then promptly bought
more. So, moral of the story I guess is that I should give up on gel pens."

jaero7,"January 3, 2022","I really love the marker part of this pen.  I got this as a free gift, and I had
never tried the Kokuyo Mark+ before.  I like it better than the Uni Emott pens -
the tip is finer and the color is richer (so easier to read).  One star off
because I have no need for the highlighter and I wish they made a Kokuyo Mark
version (with the Mark being just the pen; Mark+ including pen+highlighter). 
But overall, I'm really glad I got to try this!!  I had always passed it up
because of the highlighter."
ss8792,"December 27, 2021","These are the best! I bought these for my Kokuyo Jibun Techo Biz Diary, but they

beautiful! What more could you want!? I highly recommend these for anyone!"

mail,"October 25, 2011","More info and pictures on http://www.elizafrye.com/wordpress/?p=1745 The BoxIn typical Japanese fashion, the pen is packaged better than most Christmas
presents. It comes in a slipcase box with gold foil details, and just opening it
made me feel special. Look at that rice paper hang tag! I’m a professional
artist now. The InkThe pen comes with three cartridges, and the ink itself is actually pretty
decent. It’s water based and flows beautifully through the pen. Not quite as
opaque as I would like, but then I find almost all inks disappointing in that
regard. Luckily using the Platinum Converter the pen can be filled with any type
of ink. Pretty awesome! Replacement Brush tips are also available. I feel better
about a tool when I can replace its key parts. The BrushThe pen itself has a really sleek matte finish that just feels good in your
hands. The response of the brush is very similar to the other Kuretake brush
pens, but better in all the ways you would expect from natural hair. It holds a
nice point and produces gorgeous line quality. Quick strokes result in a dry
brush effect that I found especially pleasing. The pen’s versatility of line
is definitely it’s strongest feature. I used it for all of my Mid-Ohio Comic
Con sketches, and could only have been happier if the tip were slightly larger,
specifically size #6 like my favorite Isabey brush. Like any natural hair brush, the No. 40 will be your best friend for life if you
pamper it just a little. The instruction booklet recommends washing out the
brush tip if it gets stiff or sits unused for a long period of time. ‘A long
period of time’ to me means more than 24 hours, so the one to five day washing
procedure is a little annoying and perhaps the pen’s only downside.  The ConclusionIf inking a line with anything besides your favorite sable-haired workhorse
makes your eyebrows crinkle and your mouth scrunch up, this pen is for you. The
No. 40 is beautiful to hold, performs like a champion racehorse, and comes in
elite fancy packaging. However, if you just need a fantastic travel brush, I
recommend the No. 13. I wore mine out and would have bought it again if the No.
40 didn’t mash all of my brush snob buttons. Congratulations Kuretake, you win
the Best Brush Pen Prize. For life."
blackirish72,"April 25, 2012","i'm not sure how to rate this pen yet. i used the pentel pocket brush for years,
it got a TON of use and i really put it through its paces. eventually, the tip
lost it point and i decided to move on instead of replacing it. my biggest
complaint about the pentel was the ink. i eventually had to buy specific paper
to keep the ink from feathering. moving on to the kuretaka was a big step because i'm used to more disposable
materials. i figured i'd take the plunge if it was durable and from what i could
gather everyone seems to love it. immediately, i liked the ink more. the sable
hair tip is even more like using a real brush (which i still use) than the
pentel.  here's my complaint though. only had the pen for a few months and the tip is
already garbage. it no longer gives the thin lines i like, like old blown-out
brushes. i don't know. pretty disappointed. not too thrilled about forking out
another $30 + to get a new tip when i've only had a few months, especially since
the pen is nearly $70.  did i get a defective brush tip? "
disappearingact,"July 10, 2010","Update: I just got a bottle of the Platinum Carbon ink from JetPens and a
converter, and the pen has ratcheted up into the amazing category. Dries dark,
quick, and no feathering on any of the papers I tried in my last review. The
downside: I basically spent $90 on a brushpen system. But it's the most like a
brush I've seen and I can get really detailed thin lines with it-- and since the
ink is in a pretty big bottle, it's going to last me quite a while. So I'd recommend if you have the money to invest, ditching the ink in favor of
the Carbon ink and refilling yourself with a converter or syringe. It's night
and day."
TheHOINK,"March 28, 2009","Hello, and a wonderfull (whatever daytime you might be reading this...)  I am one of the crazy illustrators and freelance-artists mentioned here, who
eagerly requested these pens, nib refills AND Pens... This pen is proof that even the best synthetics can not mess with mother natures
gifts. The Kuretake DV140-40/50 is THE best Brushpen I have ever had the pleasure to
handle.  TIP:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------- It's natural sable bristles offer a higher flexibility than any other pen with a
brush-like tip you might find on this page, better than the Pentel GFKP FP10 or
the Kuretake DV140-13C or or or... I have them all, but THIS one is the best. In the beginning there is a cartridge inserted in the tip with oil and water, so
the bristles do not dry out, a very clever idea by the company. The Bristles spring back to a sharp point, offer a very high resiliency and very
good controll of pressure and line width. After 9 months of being in use and 27 used cartridges, the tip looks quite like
new, so the possibility to buy spare/replacement tips/nibs is great and counts
as a plus, but it is not necessary too often, a second plus. Sometimes you should clean the tip, just use some cold to mid-temperated water
and wipe the pen out on a clean tissue.For larger areas, you should, after all, stick to synthetic bristles, since
natural hair is more about control and detail, and not for fast colouring of
large areas, which would (di)stress the hairs a lot.  BARREL AND
CAP:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- The Pen closes with a wonderfull clicking sound, and you can feel the
""resistance"" of the pen while closing the cap, so you know it is ""closed"" and
tight. It gives you a good feeling about the bristles not getting too much air
and drying out. The Barrel and Cap are made out of Aluminium or resin, it seems, it seems more
durable in feel and more elegant in look than the Pentel GFKP. Maybe thus the
price is so much higher, but invested this pen it is more than worth the money. For some people this pen might seem heavy, it is around 18 to 20 gramms,
somewhere very close to the Pilot Décimo which has 20gr. So it might be too
heavy for some, but it is perfect for me. The Price is very moderate for a pen of this quality.  INK:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------- The Ink is a very dark and saturated black, watersoluble and even after drying
not waterproof. If you want to make washes or use aquarellistic colours on your
paintings, do it before using the Kuretake-ink, and you will be fine. And you can use any ""noodlers"" (have not tried the eel-inks) to refill empty
cartridges with a syringe.  IN THE
END:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------- Kuretake DV140-40 AND DV140-50 are all getting five stars, since they are very
close one to antoher in weight, and since they share the same tip their
performance equals one another very closely, too. And they are highly better than the synthetic counterparts of the DV140-13C. Forget about all the other brush-pens which use synthetic bristles, when you use
this kind of pens a lot, buy one with natural bristles, especially if you are up
to detailed, evry controlled work.  TheHOINK"
wckd79,"November 29, 2010","I wanted to post again after having used this pen for over a year now. Again I
have to say it is the best brush pen I have found. I have used about everyone
offered on this site, and some other random and cheap ones I have found other
places. I also have been using platinum carbon ink in it as opposed to the
regular kuretake that it comes with, and I find it works better this way. I
recommend this pen to anyone. http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y64/Angry_spirit/IMG_0334.jpg"
crewchief227,"March 3, 2012","I just recieved my pen in the mail and could not be happier. I ordered on a
tuesday and I received my package on friday with the free shipping. I do have to
say though that this pen does not come in a wood gift box but rather a cardboard
box like the 1 pictured. It does come with a oil cartridge installed in the pen
to keep three sable hair from drying out. So when you first go to use it remove
the pill cartridge and rinse the bristles in warm water then install the ink
cartridge and with a scrap piece off paper Betsy for a good 20 to 30 minutes to
get the ink flowing past the oil residue. Because off those three ink will be
quite thin and grey for the first day until you work work enough ink through it.
After that though I am happy to report that the ink supplied is water proof and
even stands up to alcohol markers such as my Copics. The sable tip is wonderful
and I finally jabber a brush poem that it's comparative to my inking brushes. I
had been using a Pentel pocket brush pen and can say that this pen is in another
league and definitely worth the money."
euphonious,"February 18, 2014","I've been using this pen every day for several months now. I highly recommend
using the Platinum converter - I expended one of the included cartridges in just
two days. The pen still has to be refilled every two or three days, as I use
quite a bit of ink. It has been filled with two different kinds of Noodler's ""Bulletproof Ink""
which, for me has worked flawlessly. The ink flows a little faster than the
cartridge ink, but I draw quickly, so this is a great improvement in my eyes! Basically: this pen is perfect."
cgoose86,"March 28, 2012","Let me start by saying I think that this brush is great and is built well,
HOWEVER, I do believe I got a bad brush tip.  It tends to bend and stay bent
with little pressure applied.  The flow of the brush is a little much also.  The
ink will amass at the tip which causes heavy lines with little pressure.  Can
anyone verify that this is something wrong with the brush tip or the part where
the ink cartridge is inserted?  Maybe it got damages or was just a faulty one
off the line. I want to love this pen but at the moment i doesn't compare to my
traditional WN series 7 brush. "
soyelisao,"October 8, 2011","AMAZING!!! I absolutely love this pen. I am an illustration student and this is of the best
quality. As artists and art students, well all know of sable hair. The best hair
in the market and the longest lasting too! ( it will not loose its point) The price is what i would expect for this type of pen, actually a great price.
(they usually go for $100 or more!) Great PEN!"
wckd79,"May 14, 2009","I just received my Kuretake no. 40 and have to agree with the previous poster.
The difference the natural brush made is apparent from the first stroke. The
level of control and detail it gives is very high. I do not use them for art so
I can not comment on using them to draw, only for writing kanji as I am learning
Japanese. I have used chearp felt tips, decent synthetic nylons, and now this
sable hair. Definately a very nice brush pen, very simple an elegant in style as
well. I do not find it very heavy at all either, but sticking on the cap on the
back end in use does add a bit of weight to it. And thank you to Jet Pens for supplying us with all these great products and on
the fast service on all my orders."
disappearingact,"June 19, 2010","I want to love this pen, but so far I'm not sure. The good: this pen is one of the most responsive brush tips I've used (and I've
bought quite a few from JetPens!). It goes from thick to thin in no time, which
is awesome for expressive drawings. Snaps back to a point pretty easily too--
granted I've only had it a few days, but I'm impressed with the quality. The
packaging and pen itself are very nice and I feel like I bought a pen I'll have
for a long time, which I definitely like. The less-good: The ink. It's a very wet, not super-dark ink-- I can forgive the
color, as when I scan drawings in it's usually not an issue. But I've tried
using this on cheap printer paper, plate bristol board, a Maruman Mnemosyne
sketchbook (my favorite!) and two brands of marker paper with varying results.
I'm a lefty, and so fretting about smudging is not a new issue for me-- but
still, it didn't dry fast (and I'm in a super-dry climate in Arizona, so I can
only imagine how it'd be in a more humid place) and in the Mnemosyne there is a
tiny amount of feathering (although it seems to dry fastest on that paper).
While the feathering is not the end of the world and could be much worse, it is
a bit of a disappointment. I'm curious about using the converter, but nervous it might muck up the pen.
There's not a lot of information on the internet, and I've heard some people say
good and bad things about replacing the ink with the Platinum Carbon ink... I
have Noodler's ink here though, so if it is a better match perhaps I'll give it
a shot. Overall this is a bittersweet brushpen-- awesome for its 'hardware' but at least
for me a bit lacking when it comes to the 'software'. Better ink would make this
an amazing pen! For now I'll just say it's really pretty good and perhaps
experiment to find a better ink solution."
jason,"March 17, 2010","I'm an illustrator and was looking for a good brush pen that could emulate an
actual brush and still be pocketable. I've used brushes and brush pens for years
and this one is the best I've found, hands down. The sable hair has a good snap
that most pens are missing and holds a point perfectly. It makes a great range
of marks from very fine to thick. It also has a fantastic weight and I love the
matte finish both aesthetically and functionally. The one downside is the
supplied ink. While the flow is very nice, the opacity is not. The ink seems to
be more dark grey than black. I'd recommend getting the converter for sure. All
in all, a great tool and worth the cost, far superior to the other Kuretake
brush pens I've tried. The next best thing to using a brush!"
leebcgfx,"May 16, 2019","The good: I like the texture of the rubber-ish body. Makes it easy to handle.
Good length on the nib hair, and good shape. My hands are not large, and the
size of the brush-pen is comfortable to hold. The cap snaps on very well, and
has an inner cap to protect the brush from drying out.The bad: When I post the cap, it makes the whole brush a bit top heavy. But the
worst of all is the flow of ink to the tip. I used the ink that came with the
brush. I could start with a pretty decent flow of ink. But once used for a
moment or so, it starts to flood the tip. This of course makes it hard to
control size and quality of your lines. Then I tried other inks... same story. The last one has been Ultradraw ink by
RapidOgraph. That ink is a tad thicker, and works better, but still not well
enough to stop that flooding completely. It becomes difficult to get thin lines,
and I have a light touch. I like going from thick to thin and back to thick.
This brush works me too hard for those results. I also have the Kuretake #13
that performs better doing the same work, with the same ink. I'll add, that the
#13 is still wet though. I also have several Pentel Pocket brushes, and they do
not have this problem of flooding. This brush is just very wet - bottom line.Just to be clear,  Everyone uses their brush differently. if you do only heavier
line work, then you may love it. If you use the brush a lot, some of the heavier
india inks may work well for you. But they can ruin a brush that isn't used a
lot.If you want fine lines, try the Pentel using Ultradraw. Platinum Carbon Black is
nice, but does not have the viscosity of Ultradraw. "
Dan Stone,"September 29, 2018","One of the best! Not only a brush pen but also a stylus! I’m using it now on
my iPad. I load it with the platinum brush pen cartridges, available here at
jetpens. I’ve used it for more than a year and it still has a point. Quality
bristles. Great grippy matte finish. Looks cool. I have a brush pen collection
and this one is in my top 3 along with the Kaimei pocket brush pen and Platinum
CF-5000. "
gui_diorio,"September 5, 2017","Kuretake brush pen with natural bristles is the best !!!! Worth it. The pen came
with a cartridge containing a special oil to keep the bristles lubricated, so I
could use it immediately. I didn't had to keep it in water for some days to make
it work properly. Great customer service."
Drlolly,"August 14, 2015","This brush pen is fantastic. The brush head itself compares well to any best

marshalltrp,"August 10, 2015","A lot has been said about infrequent use causes the brush to dry out.  Well,  I
use this pen infrequently and the tip has never dried out.  I live in Las Vegas
so I would say this pen has been under adverse conditions.  I am mainly an
acrylic painter and I wanted this pen for the occasional plane trip.It has served me very well and I recommend it.  Also I highly recommend
JETPENS.COM  "
thefeeb,"May 12, 2015","Would be worth the price if the ink flow remained consistent. As with another
reviewer's experience, the amazing crisp, thin lines of the first hours, give
way to blotting, clumsy flow. I have purchased several replacement tips, and the
last one didn't last more than a few hours. Extremely frustrating, and I am
considering asking for a refund, despite my sheer love of JetPens and their
products. If the tip held for a reasonable time, I'd be more than happy to give
this 5 stars. The initial response of its use is breathtaking, crisp line and
control. Some reviewers are happy after years. This could be due to either
amount of use, type of use, or the luck of a rare tip, impervious to becoming a
lemon. I've tried several methods of preserving the flow to no avail. My first
tip lasted so long, I considered it a bargain... but I now have all of these
expensive replacements that are only good for covering larger areas of black.
I'd give it 4 stars, but the fact I'm barely into a cartridge on my new tip
before it failed, knocks another star off of this product. I even bought one of
these for my girlfriend, who barely uses it, but loves it. For her the clumsy
flow might never even be a problem. For me, however, it's everything. I need
consistency, and this falls far short of that.I suggest going with a synthetic, much as it pains me to say. Less expensive to
replace, and difference in quality is not matched by the difference in what
you'll be saving- both in cash and, of course, the animal these hairs come from.
It really bums me out to write this review... I seriously have sang the praises
of this product to so many that the irony of my rating is no small thing. "
ozbugger,"September 1, 2009","Just got the pen yesterday. After putting the ink in and getting few strokes on,
I was amaze the finesse of the brush. This is def the pinnacle of pocket brush pen. Even way finer than pentel pocket
brush and very natural. GREAT STUFF"
ruizjacob407,"January 2, 2023","I'm tempted to give it more of a 4.5 because of the brush nib. It's quite
generous in laying down ink, and a bit tricky to get the desired line widths or
textures.However, the actual pen grip is very comfortable, not to mention the weight is
satisfying, especially when paired with a converter. I ended up buying a No.13 brush nib replacement, and the pen became that much
more enjoyable. Remember, if the stationary item is satisfying to work with, it makes it that
much more valuable to you as a scribbler or artist."
artofjim,"August 29, 2022","This brush pen felt like a big investment, especially since I also got the
converter.  I have only used this pen with the converter and Platinum Carbon
Ink, not the cartridges provided.  It was 100% worth it.  I've used tons of different brush pens over the years,
from the classic Pentel Pocket Brush Pen to the big body XFP5M and a slew of
others.  I also use real brushes sometimes when inking comics.  This thing blows
all of them out of the water.The brush tip is very versatile, and has a great shape for a variety of strokes.
 I found the weight of the pen made it easier to draw fine lines (oxymoron but
trust me), but it had enough inkflow to lay out fat strokes as well and fill
areas quickly.  Refilling with the converter was easier than most fountain pens,
just make sure to do a few strokes on the edge of the ink bottle to get the
excess ink out or it will be way too juicy for awhile.  I never want to draw
with anything else after getting this.It's very fast, as in it keeps up without my strokes getting broken up with
paper texture if I'm lining too quickly.  This is something the Pocket Brush Pen
and the replaceable body brush pens never could manage unless I squeezed a lot
of ink into the brush first, but that wears off.  With the converter, the flow
stays consistent until you're almost out of ink.  When that happens, it produces
lovely dry-brushing strokes.It's also beautiful, and comes in a nice box, if you're into that sort of thing.
 I believe the only difference between the no. 40 and no. 50 is cosmetic, so I
chose the 40.One final tip: don't put the cap on the back, or put it on lightly if you do. 
It will rub a groove into the body of the pen.  I found this out after owning
the pen for a week and it was a bummer, but I don't really care about looks,
just writing efficiency.This is my forever pen, and that's only possible because the ink is refillable
and the tip is replaceable. Thank you Kuretake for a great product!"
seth,"January 28, 2022","I don't know if I got a defective unit but after about a year of off and on
usage, the pen has started to leak around the seam by the nib. In the year prior to this, the pen was a joy to use. And the lines I was able to
produce were fantastic. Disappointed that I need to spend another $25 to replace
the nib after such a short amount of time."
gabbottiii,"January 23, 2022","This was my grail pen and I didn't know until I got it. Absolutely love it. I
did have to pluck away several hairs from the tip as I was using it, but this is
a great brush pen and I can even do note-taking and journaling with it after
weeks of getting used to how it handles. You don't need a flex pen when you have
the ultimate flex of a brush tip."

this low price point, it's just a wonderful find. Thank you, JetPens!"
danelle.malan,"October 31, 2019","Wonderful to draw with! Struggles to go around tiny curves and circles neatly,
but can achieve extremely fine, lovely lines. Working very small with this may
not be ideal because the bristles are quite soft, but they hold their point
wonderfully for drawing and sketching. Get a converter and a suitable waterproof
black ink if you want to use it with watercolour. I use Platinum Carbon Ink. You
might want to buy a replacement nib with it, because you'll like working with
this so much that you will wear through your bristles."
Fabio Martins,"August 15, 2019","I´ve been using this pen for near 9 months for inking art. The tip feels much
better than every other brush pen I´ve ever used (and I tried the Pentel Pocket
Brush, several nylon tipped Kuretakes, Pilots, etc).The tip feels easier to control than any other brush pen I tried.It´s roughly the same size as the Pentel Pocket Brush and Kuretake 13. After
using all three for some time, I can make this comparison:Pentel Pocket Brush: lighter, plastic body, longer nylon tip.Kuretake 13: a bit heavier than the Pental, enamel body, nylon tip.Kuretake 40: a bit heavier than the Pental, rubberized (or maybe ""rougher""?)
body, sable hair tip.The longer tip of the Pentel makes it harder to control sometimes.The enamel body and the heavier weight of the Kuretake 13 make it harder to keep
a good grip.The Kuretake 40 has a better tip and better grip than both, making it easier to
get small details right.So it feels worth the extra price."
qetuo895,"May 15, 2019","I bought this for my husband for his birthday. This is his 2nd or 3rd, not

beautiful items."
my.life.is.confetti,"January 31, 2019","Love the brush pen. Sable hair is nice. This is the second unit I've purchased
(lost the first one)..The brush tip on both had a single hair at the tip for ultrafine lines, and more
pressure unleashed that messy natural brush look that is great for more abstract
illustrations. If used more precisely, it makes clean lines. If used more quickly during a stroke, you get tat painterly brushstroke that
draws me to brush pens for my Illustration, rather than the crisp, clean lines
of something like a Pigma Micron. "

twist the piston when un posting, spurting ink out and onto your hands and

many pens I've had last for much longer. Under the assumption that I would be
using these pens for a long time - I bought a bunch of refills along with this
set.To my surprised, one month into university and I've already chewed through two
refills. I don't think its a problem of it running out of ink - I think it dries
up or gets suck somehow :\. I've tried many solutions but its never the same

fountain pen. If you don't mind the occasional re-dipping of the pen tip for
restocking ink in the breather hole then I would recommend this for writing
and/or drawing. The scratchy-ness of the fine  nib when writing really didn't
bother me.  My new writing pen for at home. Very satisfied with my  purchase.
Excited to receive the restock notification email for the same dip pen except
the transparent blue plastic body medium nib planning to buy that as well."

npatel,"January 24, 2015","This is a great pen.  I love the look of the pen and the grip that extends to
the very bottom of the pen (I tend to hold pens close to the tip).  The ink
flows easily and doesn't smear or smudge.  The only bad thing about this pen is
that the clicker rattles when pushed in.  However, this isn't really noticeable
unless you're shaking the pencil around a lot -- I don't notice this when
writing."
vandreww,"April 20, 2014","This pen has now become my favorite pen.  It is a thin line, but still managed
to be a nice dark black, while drying fast, which I need because I am left
handed.  I have bought four more of these pens because of my experience with
this pen."
kate.foreman,"January 13, 2014","I bought this and a Ohto Slimline retractable in the same order. One reviewer
said they used to love the Signo, but now the slimline is their fave. Not the
case with me. The 0.38 Signo is very smooth and balanced, while the slimline is
far too slim a body (and I have pretty small hands!) The slimline is quite
scratchy too which I find irritating, but otherwise writes fine. It's just not
my first choice. The Uni-ball Signo is now my very first choice. A great pen all
around."
JoslynMSU,"March 21, 2013","The pen has a VERY fine tip which I prefer.  It lays down a very thin line (hair
thin), but it is dark and doesn't skip.  Some rattling in the clip when writing,
but I do not find it distracting.  The design is sleek and it works very well."
Francesca,"February 7, 2021","I bought the Black in the 0.28 and 0.38 mm tips after trying the 0.5 mm one,
which laid down too much ink for my writing style. These smaller tips were
perfect for smaller spaces; even if they are tiny, they both have vibrant and
rich ink that looks black, not grey. The tips are not scratchy, but I do feel
the texture of the paper under them; if I write with smooth paper, the pens are
very smooth. They are comfortable to hold, and I like the click mechanism. I
find the 0.38 mm RT1 smoother than the same-sized Signo DX. Sometimes, I write
with these pens on larger ruling just because I like them so much, even if
there’s need to go that thin. Even so, the text remains readable and doesn’t
look like a spider’s web!"
kevinmorse1,"September 5, 2016","I needed the retractable version because of the nature of my job. I can not
constantly be capping and uncapping pens while I am trying to quickly see
patients. The click on this one feels very nice. This pen has never skipped on
me--not once--and I have been using it for months now. The 0.38 mm was initially
bizarre to me and I did not like it because I write really large I discovered,
but these pens ALLOW you to write very tiny and fit a lot of information into
places you normally would think you couldn't. It really changed a lot about how
I write. At my work I fill out a lot of charts with patient information and I
was loving how much more I could fit into boxes using it. I would highly
recommend this pen."

ADR in NY,"February 17, 2019","Bold, smooth ink. I was pleasantly surprised when I put this pen to paper. My
favorite point size has always been 0.7 mm, so I was stunned to discover that I
actually enjoy writing with a 0.38, especially on smooth, good quality paper.
The clip rattles when the tip is extended. Doesn't bother me much but might for
others. I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this pen in this
point size."
HD8439,"December 8, 2018",I love this pen more than UM-151. 0.38 is better than 0.28 in my opinion.
25miscellanous,"June 26, 2018","Sleek and comfortable at the same time. It has the same ink as the Uni Signo DX,
but without the cap and for the same price. It also stands out among the pens of
your classmates and is a good gift to a studious high school student. The clip
is the most flimsiest part of the pen, but is usable"
Ryan,"January 13, 2018","I purchased this pen for many reasons, the body design and the point size
(.38mm), as my handwriting is on the smaller side. I tried this pen on several
different kinds of paper--most of which did not work well with this pen--and
only one was able to showcase the pen's writing qualities. A graphing notebook
found on my college campus. It produces very dark lines, very thin but tends to be on the wetter side.
overall, 3 stars"
miqktb,"February 17, 2016","Really a perfect pen for what I was looking for in a pen. 1) precision and

collection (for collectors) and every day users."
analisathecat,"February 7, 2016","Amazing pen ! Picked up one day in the store and never looked back. This is

a few weeks of use it started to skip a little. I will continue to use this pen,
but not sure if I would order it again."
brownrray,"February 15, 2014","The Uni-ball Signo RT1 UMN-155 is as innocuous as a pen can get. Once you pick
it up and start writing with it, you will not want another black 0.38 pen.
Consistently smooth, jet color, never skips,... amazing. Big tip of the hat to
the folks at Uni-ball. They did it again."
bam.mead,"December 8, 2022","Super precise, writes smoother than you would anticipate"
Caroline,"October 18, 2022","I love how the grip section goes right down to the tip, my grip tends to be very
far down and this pen is comfortable there. This has become my most-used pen,
with a Jetstream cartridge installed. Super basic but you can't go wrong with
it. The deep-carry style clip is also nice, so there's very little pen sticking
out of any pocket or pen loop it's in."

probably not survive the academic year."
killersim00,"July 20, 2022","This is my favorite pen for note taking. This is the pen I won't lend to anyone

always predictable and nicely pigmented. The retraction has a nice satisfying
click and a slightly rubbery grip that I like. "

The tip is sharp and scratchy compared with Juice Up 0.4, but when I’m writing
really small in margins I prefer more feedback and so the Signo fills that bill.
 When I’m writing a letter I prefer smoothness and that’s when I use the
Juice Up."

buy a second one was that I lost my first one. I searched for about an hour and
by the end of the day I had already ordered a new one. This pen goes everywhere
with me, I use it every day for my planner, journal and any paperwork I need to
do. I have tried plenty of other pens in an attempt to switch things up a bit
but I always end up back at my Signo. The ink flows smoothly, the tip is sturdy,
it is comfortable to use and refills are easy enough to find and cheap enough to
make it a reasonable pen. Each refill lasts for several months of daily use. You
really can't go wrong with this purchase!"

it felt a bit like a cheap plastic pen. It still feels that way whenever I hold
it but it definitely doesn't feel that way while writing.In contrast to most people I am someone who loves thick, inky lines. The darker
the ink the better. I veer away toward thin pens, especially due to the scratchy
feeling many have as though you are grating a needle against paper. This has
minimal scratch, but admittedly the sound the pen makes against the paper is
abnormally loud. The grip is very comfortable, when I write the pen feels very
balanced. The ink is phenomenal, very dark black and doesn't skip. "

them as much.  4 stars because I prefer 0.4 to 0.38."
Kitty,"December 21, 2020","Like Signo 207, but with a body that looks like a mix of Juice Up and Sarasa
Clip... and uses the same ink as the 207. In a way, the very existence of this
is kind of boggling; it looks cheaper, with no metal parts in sight, but it also
seems to be designed/finished/engineered better... and is quite a bit more
expensive. What a strange pen."

HaPo,"August 21, 2017","This pen is just okay...skips an awful lot and feels really scratchy to write
with. Maybe it's because it's so thin? It started out okay to write with but at
this point it's very unpleasant to use."
chelicocat,"January 27, 2016","I just love uni-ball. Most of their pens are a dream to write with, so smooth
and pretty and fine. This is definitely just as wonderful as all those other
pens, and it has the added benefit of being retractable. The pen is so
comfortable to write with because of its smooth grip, and so far I have
experienced no skipping. Absolute delight!"
